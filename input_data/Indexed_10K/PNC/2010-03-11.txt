ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY PNC is one of the largest diversified financial services companies in the United States and is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. PNC has businesses engaged in retail banking, corporate and institutional banking, asset management, residential mortgage banking and global investment servicing, providing many of its products and services nationally and others in PNCs primary geographic markets located in Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, Michigan, Maryland, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Florida, Missouri, Virginia, Delaware, Washington, D.C., and Wisconsin. PNC also provides certain investment servicing internationally. On December 31, 2008, PNC acquired National City Corporation (National City). Our consolidated financial statements for 2009 reflect the impact of National City. The impact of National City is described where appropriate throughout this Report. We expect to incur additional merger and integration costs in 2010 of approximately $285 million pretax in connection with the acquisition of National City. We previously recognized $421 million pretax in 2009, including $155 million pretax in the fourth quarter, and $575 million pretax in the fourth quarter of 2008. The transaction is expected to result in the reduction of more than $1.5 billion of combined company annualized noninterest expense through the elimination of operational and administrative redundancies. We continue to integrate the businesses and operations of National City with those of PNC. REPURCHASE OF OUTSTANDING TARP PREFERRED STOCK As further described in Note 19 Equity in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, on December 31, 2008, we issued $7.6 billion of Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Shares, Series N (Series N Preferred Stock), and the related warrant to the US Treasury under the US Treasurys Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Capital Purchase Program. As approved by the Federal Reserve Board, the US Treasury and our other banking regulators, on February 10, 2010, we redeemed all 75,792 shares of our Series N Preferred Stock held by the US Treasury totaling $7.6 billion. We used the net proceeds from our February 2010 common stock and senior notes offerings, described further in the Liquidity Risk Management section of this Item 7, and other funds to redeem the Series N Preferred Stock. Dividends of $89 million were paid on February 10, 2010 when the Series N Preferred Stock was redeemed. PNC paid total dividends of $421 million to the US Treasury while the Series N Preferred Stock was outstanding. We did not exercise our right to seek to repurchase the related warrant at the time we redeemed the Series N Preferred Stock. PENDING SALE OF PNC GLOBAL INVESTMENT SERVICING On February 2, 2010, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell PNC Global Investment Servicing Inc. (GIS), a leading provider of processing, technology and business intelligence services to asset managers, broker dealers and financial advisors worldwide, for $2.3 billion in cash. Upon completion of the sale, we expect to report an after tax gain of approximately $455 million. We currently anticipate closing the transaction in the third quarter of 2010. Completion of the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and certain other closing conditions. If the sale of GIS is not completed by November 1, 2010, we will be required, on or before that date, to raise $700 million in additional Tier 1 common capital. We would do this either through the sale of assets approved by the Federal Reserve Board and or through the issuance of additional common stock. See Item 1A Risk Factors in this Report for additional information. Further information regarding the National City acquisition and the pending sale of GIS is included in Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures in our Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements within Item 8 of this Report. KEY STRATEGIC GOALS We manage our company for the long term and are focused on returning to a moderate risk profile while maintaining strong capital and liquidity positions, investing in our markets and products, and embracing our corporate responsibility to the communities where we do business. Our strategy to enhance shareholder value centers on driving pre tax, pre provision earnings in excess of credit costs by achieving growth in revenue from our balance sheet and diverse business mix that exceeds growth in expenses controlled through disciplined cost management. The primary drivers of revenue growth are the acquisition, expansion and retention of customer relationships. We strive to expand our customer base by offering convenient banking options and leading technology solutions, providing a broad range of fee based and credit products and services, focusing on customer service, and through a significantly enhanced branding initiative. We may also grow revenue through appropriate and targeted acquisitions and, in certain businesses, by expanding into new geographical markets. We are focused on our strategies for quality growth. We are committed to returning to a moderate risk profile 22 characterized by disciplined credit management and limited exposure to earnings volatility resulting from interest rate fluctuations and the shape of the interest rate yield curve. We made substantial progress in transitioning our balance sheet throughout 2009, working to institute our moderate risk philosophy throughout our expanded franchise. Our actions have created a well positioned balance sheet, strong bank level liquidity and investment flexibility to adjust, where appropriate and permissible, to changing interest rates and market conditions. We also continue to be focused on building capital in the current environment characterized by economic and regulatory uncertainty. See the Funding and Capital Sources section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section and the Liquidity Risk Management section of this Item 7. SUPERVISORY CAPITAL ASSESSMENT PROGRAM (STRESS TESTS) On May 7, 2009, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System announced the results of the stress tests conducted by banking regulators under the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program with respect to the 19 largest bank holding companies. As a result of this test, the Federal Reserve concluded that PNC was well capitalized but that, in order to provide a greater cushion against the risk that economic conditions over the next two years are worse than currently anticipated, PNC needed to augment the composition of its capital by increasing the common shareholders equity component of Tier 1 capital. In May 2009 we raised $624 million in new common equity through the issuance of 15 million shares of common stock. In connection with the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, we submitted a capital plan which was accepted by the Federal Reserve. RECENT MARKET AND INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTS Since the middle of 2007 and with a heightened level of activity during 2008 and 2009, there has been unprecedented turmoil, volatility and illiquidity in worldwide financial markets, accompanied by uncertain prospects for sustaining a fragile economic recovery that began mid year 2009. In addition, there have been dramatic changes in the competitive landscape of the financial services industry during this time. Recent efforts by the Federal government, including the US Congress, the US Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, to stabilize and restore confidence in the financial services industry have impacted and will likely continue to impact PNC and our stakeholders. These efforts, which will continue to evolve, include the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and other legislative, administrative and regulatory initiatives, including the US Treasurys TARP Capital Purchase Program, the FDICs Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) and the Federal Reserves Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF). These programs include the following: TARP CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM The TARP Capital Purchase Program enabled US financial institutions to build capital through the sale to the US Treasury of senior preferred shares of stock to increase the flow of financing to US businesses and consumers and to support the US economy. Note 19 Equity included in our Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements within Item 8 of this Report includes information regarding the preferred stock and the related warrant that we issued under this program. See Repurchase of Outstanding TARP Preferred Stock above. FDIC TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY GUARANTEE PROGRAM The FDICs TLGP is designed to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by: Guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of eligible institutions, including FDIC insured banks and thrifts, as well as certain holding companies (TLGP Debt Guarantee Program), and Providing full deposit insurance coverage for non interest bearing transaction accounts in FDIC insured institutions, regardless of the dollar amount (TLGP Transaction Account Guarantee Program). In December 2008, PNC Funding Corp issued fixed and floating rate senior notes totaling $2.9 billion under the FDICs TLGP Debt Guarantee Program. In March 2009, PNC Funding Corp issued floating rate senior notes totaling $1.0 billion under this program. Each of these series of senior notes is guaranteed through maturity by the FDIC. From October 14, 2008 through December 31, 2009, PNC Bank, National Association (PNC Bank, N.A.) participated in the TLGP Transaction Account Guarantee Program. Under this program, all non interest bearing transaction accounts were fully guaranteed by the FDIC for the entire amount in the account. Coverage under this program is in addition to, and separate from, the coverage available under the FDICs general deposit insurance rules. Beginning January 1, 2010, PNC Bank, N.A. is no longer participating in the TLGP Transaction Account Guarantee Program. Thus, as of December 31, 2009, funds held in noninterest bearing transaction accounts were no longer guaranteed in full under the TLGP Transaction Account Guarantee Program, but are insured up to $250,000 under the FDICs general deposit insurance rules. Federal Reserve Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) Effective October 28, 2008, Market Street Funding LLC (Market Street) was approved to participate in the Federal 23 Reserves CPFF. The CPFF commitment to purchase up to $5.4 billion of three month Market Street commercial paper expired on February 1, 2010. Market Street had no borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2009 or during the year then ended. Public Private Investment Fund Programs (PPIFs) In March 2009, the US Treasury and the FDIC announced that they would establish the Legacy Loans Program (LLP) to remove troubled loans and other assets from banks. The FDIC will provide oversight for the formation, funding, and operation of new PPIFs that will purchase loans and other assets from depository institutions. The LLP will attract private capital through an FDIC debt guarantee and Treasury equity co investment. All FDIC insured depository institutions will be eligible to participate in the program. In March 2009, the US Treasury also announced the establishment of the Legacy Securities PPIFs, which are designed to address issues raised by troubled assets. These Legacy Securities PPIFs are specifically focused on legacy securities and are part of a plan that directs both equity capital and debt financing into the market for legacy assets. This program is designed to draw in private capital to these markets by providing matching equity capital from the US Treasury and debt financing from the Federal Reserve via the Term Asset Backed Loan Facility (TALF) and the US Treasury. PNC has not participated in these programs and is determining to what extent, if any, it will participate in these programs. Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) As part of its effort to stabilize the US housing market, in March 2009 the Obama Administration published detailed guidelines implementing HAMP, and authorized servicers to begin loan modifications. PNC began participating in HAMP for GSE mortgages in May and for non GSE mortgages in July, and is evaluating participation in the Second Lien Program. This program is scheduled to terminate as of December 31, 2012. Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) Another part of its efforts to stabilize the US housing market is the Obama Administrations Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP), which provides a means for certain borrowers to refinance their mortgage loans. PNC began participating in HARP in May 2009. The program is scheduled to terminate as of June 10, 2010. In June 2009 the US Treasury issued a report entitled Financial Regulatory Reform: A New Foundation which outlined five key objectives: Promote robust supervision and regulation of financial firms, Establish comprehensive supervision of financial markets, Protect consumers and investors from financial abuse, Provide the US government with the tools it needs to manage financial crises, and Raise international regulatory standards and improve international cooperation. To implement the proposals set forth in the US Treasury report, as well as to provide economic stimulus and financial market stability and to enhance the liquidity and solvency of financial institutions and markets, the US Congress and federal banking agencies have announced, and are continuing to develop, additional legislation, regulations and programs. These proposals include changes in or additions to the statutes or regulations related to existing programs, including those described above. The current regulatory environment remains uncertain and we expect greater reforms and additional regulatory changes. While we believe that we are well positioned to navigate through this process, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these actions on PNCs business plans and strategies. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Our financial performance is substantially affected by several external factors outside of our control including the following, some of which may be affected by legislative, regulatory and administrative initiatives, such as the Federal government initiatives outlined above: General economic conditions, including the speed and stamina of the fragile recovery, The level of, and direction, timing and magnitude of movement in, interest rates and the shape of the interest rate yield curve, The functioning and other performance of, and availability of liquidity in, the capital and other financial markets, Loan demand, utilization of credit commitments and standby letters of credit, and asset quality, Customer demand for other products and services, Changes in the competitive and regulatory landscape and in counterparty creditworthiness and performance as the financial services industry restructures in the current environment, and The impact of market credit spreads on asset valuations. In addition, our success will depend, among other things, upon: Further success in the acquisition, growth and retention of customers, Progress toward completion of the integration of the National City acquisition, The closing of our planned 2010 sale of GIS, Continued development of the geographic markets related to our recent acquisitions, including full deployment of our product offerings, 24 Revenue growth, A sustained focus on expense management, including achieving our cost savings targets associated with our National City integration, and creating positive pre tax, pre provision earnings, Managing the distressed assets portfolio and other impaired assets, Maintaining our overall asset quality and continuing to meet evolving regulatory capital standards, Continuing to maintain and grow our deposit base as a low cost funding source, Prudent risk and capital management leading to a return to our desired moderate risk profile, and Actions we take within the capital and other financial markets. Summary Financial Results Year ended December 31 2009 2008 Net income, in millions $ 2,403 $ 914 Diluted earnings per common share Continuing operations $ 4.26 $ 2.10 Discontinued operations .10 .34 Net income $ 4.36 $ 2.44 Return on Average common shareholders equity 9.78 % 6.52 % Average assets .87 % .64 % On December 1, 2009, BlackRock acquired Barclays Global Investors (BGI) from Barclays Bank PLC. PNC recognized a pretax gain of $1.076 billion, or $687 million after taxes, in the fourth quarter of 2009 related to this transaction. Additional information regarding this transaction is included within the BlackRock section of our Business Segments Review section of this Item 7. Our earnings and related per share amounts for 2008 do not include the impact of National City, which we acquired effective December 31, 2008, other than a conforming adjustment to our provision for credit losses of $504 million and other integration costs of $71 million, both of which were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2008 includes National Citys assets and liabilities at estimated fair value. Our performance in 2009 included the following: We remain committed to responsible lending to support economic growth. Loans and commitments originated and renewed totaled approximately $110 billion in 2009. Included were $4 billion of small business loans originated and renewed in 2009, and we have enhanced our second look programs for small business loan applications. As of December 31, 2009, we had funded approximately 2,100 refinances totaling $.4 billion through the Home Affordable Refinance Program and over 70,000 solicitations under the Home Affordable Modification Program had been sent to eligible borrowers. Loans totaled $158 billion at December 31, 2009 and declined 2% during the fourth quarter reflecting a slower pace of decline compared with the first nine months of 2009. We effectively managed deposit pricing and realigned the deposit mix during 2009, growing transaction deposits by $15 billion, or 14%, and reducing nonrelationship certificates of deposit by approximately $16 billion. Pretax, pre provision earnings of $7.2 billion exceeded the provision for credit losses by $3.2 billion for 2009. Total revenue was $16.2 billion for 2009, reflecting our diverse revenue sources. The net interest margin increased 45 basis points to 3.82% in 2009 compared with 2008. Noninterest expense totaled $9.1 billion in 2009, including $421 million of integration costs offset by $800 million of acquisition cost savings. The pace of credit quality deterioration continued to ease during the fourth quarter of 2009. Nonperforming assets increased $.7 billion over the third quarter to $6.3 billion, a lower increase compared with the $1.0 billion increase in the third quarter. We strengthened loan loss reserves for the 11th consecutive quarter. The allowance for loan and lease losses of $5.1 billion combined with $4.9 billion of marks on acquired impaired loans represented approximately 6% of loans outstanding at December 31, 2009. Capital ratios continued to grow. The Tier 1 common equity ratio increased by 50 basis points to 6.0% at December 31, 2009 and the Tier 1 risk based capital ratio increased by 50 basis points to 11.4% as of year end. We continued to maintain a strong bank liquidity position with an 84% loan to deposit ratio at December 31, 2009. Holding company liquidity remained strong with sufficient liquid assets to fund 2010 debt maturities and other corporate obligations. The acquisition of National City Corporation exceeded our expectations during 2009. The transaction was accretive to 2009 earnings. Cost savings of over $800 million were realized in 2009. We increased our multi year acquisition related annualized cost savings goal to $1.5 billion from $1.2 billion and are on track to meet the new goal. We have successfully completed two major conversions of National City customers to the PNC platform one in November 2009 and another in February 2010. We expect to complete the two remaining conversions by June 2010, ahead of original plans. We completed the consolidation of bank charters in November 2009. 25 Our Consolidated Income Statement Review and Consolidated Balance Sheet Review sections of this Item 7 describe in greater detail the various items that impacted our results for 2009 and 2008. LINE OF BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS In the first quarter of 2009, we made changes to our business organization structure and management reporting in conjunction with the acquisition of National City. Business segment results for 2008 and 2007 in this Report have been reclassified to reflect current methodologies and current business and management structure and to present all periods on the same basis. As a result of its pending sale, GIS is no longer a reportable business segment. Results for 2009 for all of our business segments except BlackRock reflect the impact of revenues and expenses associated with businesses acquired with National City. Highlights of results for 2009 and 2008 are included below. We refer you to Item 1 of this Report under the captions Business Overview and Review of Lines of Business for an overview of our business segments and to the Business Segments Review section of this Item 7 for a Results Of Businesses Summary table and further analysis of business segment results for 2009 and 2008, including presentation differences from Note 27 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. We provide a reconciliation of total business segment earnings to PNC consolidated income from continuing operations as reported on a GAAP basis in Note 27. Retail Banking Retail Bankings earnings were $136 million for 2009 compared with $328 million for 2008. Results were challenged in this environment by increased credit costs, lower interest credits assigned to the segments deposits, reduced consumer spending and increased FDIC insurance costs. Pre tax, pre provision earnings were $1.6 billion for 2009, a 65% increase over 2008. Retail Banking continues to maintain its focus on customer, loan and deposit growth, employee and customer satisfaction, investing in the business for future growth, as well as disciplined expense management during this period of market and economic uncertainty. Corporate & Institutional Banking Corporate & Institutional Banking earned $1.2 billion in 2009 compared with $215 million in 2008. The acquisition of National City positively impacted operating results as revenues nearly tripled while noninterest expense approximately doubled. As a result, operating leverage of $2.6 billion more than offset a $1.0 billion increase in the provision for credit losses. Asset Management Group Asset Management Group earned $105 million for 2009 compared with $119 million for 2008. Asset Management Group achieved strong total revenue of $919 million, with $308 million in net interest income and $611 million in noninterest income. The business increased pretax, pre provision earnings by $69 million or 35% over 2008, as the business grew clients, managed expenses and successfully executed the National City integration. The earnings decline from 2008 was primarily driven by a $91 million increase in provision for credit losses reflective of a weakened economy. Residential Mortgage Banking Residential Mortgage Banking earned $435 million in 2009 driven by strong loan origination activity and net mortgage servicing rights hedging gains. This business segment consists primarily of activities acquired with National City. BlackRock Our BlackRock business segment earned $207 million in both 2009 and 2008. These results reflect our share of BlackRocks reported GAAP earnings during both periods and the additional income taxes on these earnings incurred by PNC. Distressed Assets Portfolio The Distressed Assets Portfolio had earnings of $84 million for 2009. Earnings were largely driven by net interest income of $1.1 billion. The provision for credit losses was $771 million in 2009, which reflected credit quality deterioration, particularly in the commercial residential development and consumer residential construction portfolios. Noninterest expense was $246 million for 2009, comprised primarily of costs associated with foreclosed assets and servicing costs. Other Other earnings were $201 million in 2009 compared with a loss of $73 million in 2008. Results for 2009 included the $687 million after tax impact of the BlackRock/BGI gain partially offset by the after tax impact of other than temporary impairment charges and alternative investment writedowns, integration costs related primarily to the National City acquisition, a special FDIC assessment, and equity management losses. Other for 2008 included the impact of integration costs, including the National City conforming provision for credit losses, totaling $422 million after taxes. In addition, net securities losses in 2008 totaled $134 million after taxes. These factors were partially offset by strong growth in net interest income related to asset and liability management activities, a gain related to PNCs remaining BlackRock long term incentive plan programs (LTIP) shares obligation, the reversal of a legal contingency reserve established in connection with an acquisition due to a settlement, the partial reversal of the Visa indemnification liability and the gain from our sale of Hilliard Lyons. 26 CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW Net income for 2009 was $2.4 billion and for 2008 was $914 million. Amounts for 2009 include operating results of National City and the fourth quarter impact of a $687 million after tax gain related to BlackRocks acquisition of BGI. Increases in income statement comparisons to 2008, except as noted, are primarily due to the operating results of National City. Our Consolidated Income Statement is presented in Item 8 of this Report. NET INTEREST INCOME AND NET INTEREST MARGIN Year ended December 31 Dollars in millions 2009 2008 Net interest income $ 9,083 $ 3,854 Net interest margin 3.82 % 3.37 % Changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest earning assets and related yields, interest bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and noninterest bearing sources of funding. See Statistical Information Analysis Of Year To Year Changes In Net Interest (Unaudited) Income And Average Consolidated Balance Sheet and Net Interest Analysis in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Higher net interest income for 2009 compared with 2008 reflected the increase in average interest earning assets due to National City and the improvement in the net interest margin. The net interest margin was 3.82% for 2009 and 3.37% for 2008. The following factors impacted the comparison: A decrease in the rate accrued on interest bearing liabilities of 97 basis points. The rate accrued on interest bearing deposits, the largest component, decreased 107 basis points. These factors were partially offset by a 45 basis point decrease in the yield on interest earning assets. The yield on loans, which represented the largest portion of our earning assets in 2009, decreased 30 basis points. In addition, the impact of noninterest bearing sources of funding decreased 7 basis points. For comparing to the broader market, the average Federal funds rate was .16% for 2009 compared with 1.94% for 2008. We expect our net interest income for 2010 will likely be modestly lower as a result of cash recoveries on purchased impaired loans in 2009 and additional run off of higher yielding assets, which could be mitigated by rising interest rates. This assumes our current expectations for interest rates and economic conditions we include our current economic assumptions underlying our forward looking statements in the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information section of this Item 7. NONINTEREST INCOME Summary Noninterest income was $7.1 billion for 2009 and $2.4 billion for 2008. Noninterest income for 2009 included the following: The gain on BlackRock/BGI transaction of $1.076 billion, Net credit related other than temporary impairments (OTTI) on debt and equity securities of $577 million, Net gains on sales of securities of $550 million, Gains on hedging of residential mortgage servicing rights of $355 million, Valuation and sale income related to our commercial mortgage loans held for sale, net of hedges, of $107 million, Gains of $103 million related to our BlackRock LTIP shares adjustment in the first quarter, and net losses on private equity and alternative investments of $93 million. Noninterest income for 2008 included the following: Net OTTI on debt and equity securities of $312 million, Gains of $246 million related to our BlackRock LTIP shares adjustment, Valuation and sale losses related to our commercial mortgage loans held for sale, net of hedges, of $197 million, Impairment and other losses related to private equity and alternative investments of $180 million, Income from Hilliard Lyons totaling $164 million, including the first quarter gain of $114 million from the sale of this business, Net gains on sales of securities of $106 million, and A gain of $95 million related to the redemption of a portion of our Visa Class B common shares related to Visas March 2008 initial public offering. Additional analysis Asset management revenue increased $172 million to $858 million in 2009, compared with $686 million in 2008. This increase reflected improving equity markets, new business generation and a shift in assets into higher yielding equity investments during the second half of 2009. Assets managed totaled $103 billion at both December 31, 2009 and 2008, including the impact of National City. The Asset Management Group section of the Business Segments Review section of this Item 7 includes further discussion of assets under management. Consumer services fees totaled $1.290 billion in 2009 compared with $623 million in 2008. Service charges on deposits totaled $950 million for 2009 and $372 million for 2008. Both increases were primarily driven by the impact of the National City acquisition. Reduced consumer spending, 27 given economic conditions, hindered PNC legacy growth during 2009 in both categories. Corporate services revenue totaled $1.021 billion in 2009 compared with $704 million in 2008. Corporate services fees include treasury management fees which increased $221 million in 2009 compared with 2008. Residential mortgage fees totaled $990 million in 2009. Fees from strong mortgage refinancing volumes, especially in the first quarter, and $355 million of net hedging gains from mortgage servicing rights contributed to this total. We do not expect to repeat this strong performance in 2010. Other noninterest income totaled $987 million for 2009 compared with $263 million for 2008. Other noninterest income for 2009 included trading income of $170 million, valuation and sale income related to our commercial mortgage loans held for sale, net of hedges, of $107 million, other gains of $103 million related to our equity investment in BlackRock and net losses on private equity and alternative investments of $93 million. Other noninterest income for 2008 included the $114 million gain from the sale of Hilliard Lyons, the $95 million Visa gain, gains of $246 million related to our equity investment in BlackRock, and losses related to our commercial mortgage loans held for sale, net of hedges, of $197 million. Other noninterest income typically fluctuates from period to period depending on the nature and magnitude of transactions completed. Further details regarding our trading activities are included in the Market Risk Management Trading Risk portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7, information regarding private equity and alternative investments are included in the Market Risk Management Equity and Other Investment Risk section, and discussion regarding gains related to our equity investment in BlackRock are included in the Business Segments Review section. With the exception of hedging gains related to residential mortgage servicing and the BlackRock/BGI gain, we expect noninterest income to be relatively flat in 2010 compared with 2009 levels. We also expect that the conversions of National City customers to the PNC platform scheduled for completion by June 2010 will create more product cross selling opportunities. PRODUCT REVENUE In addition to credit and deposit products for commercial customers, Corporate & Institutional Banking offers other services, including treasury management and capital markets related products and services and commercial mortgage banking activities, that are marketed by several businesses to commercial and retail customers. Treasury management revenue, which includes fees as well as net interest income from customer deposit balances, totaled $1.137 billion for 2009 and $567 million for 2008. In addition to the impact of National City, the increase was primarily related to deposit growth and continued growth in legacy offerings such as purchasing cards and services provided to the Federal government and healthcare customers. Revenue from capital markets related products and services totaled $533 million in 2009 compared with $336 million in 2008. The impact of National City related revenue helped to offset declines in merger and acquisition revenues reflecting the difficult economic environment. Commercial mortgage banking activities include revenue derived from commercial mortgage servicing (including net interest income and noninterest income from loan servicing and ancillary services), and revenue derived from commercial mortgage loans intended for sale and related hedges (including loan origination fees, net interest income, valuation adjustments and gains or losses on sales). Commercial mortgage banking activities resulted in revenue of $485 million in 2009 compared with $65 million in 2008. The impact of National City related revenue was reflected in the 2009 increase. Revenue for 2009 included gains of $107 million on commercial mortgage loans held for sale, net of hedges. Losses of $197 million on commercial mortgage loans held for sale, net of hedges, reduced revenue for 2008. 28 PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES The provision for credit losses totaled $3.9 billion for 2009 compared with $1.5 billion for 2008. The provision for credit losses for 2009 was in excess of net charge offs of $2.7 billion primarily due to required increases to our allowance for loan and lease losses reflecting continued deterioration in the credit markets and the resulting increase in nonperforming loans. The Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7 includes additional information regarding factors impacting the provision for credit losses. See also Item 1A Risk Factors and the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information section of Item 7 of this Report. We expect the provision for credit losses in the first quarter of 2010 to be similar to the provision recognized in the third quarter of 2009. NONINTEREST EXPENSE Noninterest expense for 2009 was $9.1 billion compared with $3.7 billion in 2008. Acquisition cost savings totaled $800 million in 2009. The increase was substantially related to National City. We also recorded a special FDIC assessment of $133 million in the second quarter of 2009, which was intended to build the FDICs Deposit Insurance Fund. Integration costs included in noninterest expense totaled $421 million in 2009 compared with $122 million in 2008. Our quarterly run rate of acquisition cost savings related to National City increased to $300 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, or $1.2 billion per year. We anticipate meaningful expense reductions in 2010, driven by acquisition cost saves, as we continue to focus on effectively managing expenses and achieving cost savings targets and credit cost improvements. EFFECTIVE TAX RATE Our effective tax rate was 26.9% for 2009 and 27.2% for 2008. The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2009 compared with 2008 was principally due to additional tax expense in 2008 related to the sale of Hilliard Lyons partially offset by additional tax expense associated with an increase in the level of pretax earnings in 2009. 29 CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET REVIEW SUMMARIZED BALANCE SHEET DATA In millions Dec. 31 2009 Dec. 312008 Assets Loans $ 157,543 $ 175,489 Investment securities 56,027 43,473 Cash and short term investments 13,290 22,911 Loans held for sale 2,539 4,366 Goodwill and other intangible assets 12,909 11,688 Equity investments 10,254 8,554 Other 17,301 24,600 Total assets $ 269,863 $ 291,081 Liabilities Deposits $ 186,922 $ 192,865 Borrowed funds 39,261 52,240 Other 11,113 18,328 Total liabilities 237,296 263,433 Total shareholders equity 29,942 25,422 Noncontrolling interests 2,625 2,226 Total equity 32,567 27,648 Total liabilities and equity $ 269,863 $ 291,081 The summarized balance sheet data above is based upon our Consolidated Balance Sheet in Item 8 of this Report. The decline in total assets at December 31, 2009 compared with December 31, 2008 was primarily due to reduced loan demand and lower interest earning deposits with banks, partially offset by an increase in lower risk investment securities. An analysis of changes in selected balance sheet categories follows. LOANS A summary of the major categories of loans outstanding follows. Outstanding loan balances reflect unearned income, unamortized discount and premium, and purchase discounts and premiums totaling $3.2 billion at December 31, 2009 and $4.3 billion at December 31, 2008, respectively. The balances do not include accretable net interest on the purchased impaired loans. Loans decreased $17.9 billion, or 10%, as of December 31, 2009 compared with December 31, 2008. Loans represented 58% of total assets at December 31, 2009 and 60% of total assets at December 31, 2008. The decline in loans during 2009 was driven primarily by lower utilization levels for commercial lending among middle market and large corporate clients, although this trend in utilization rates appeared to have eased in the fourth quarter of 2009. Given current economic conditions, we expect continued weak loan demand and low utilization rates until the economy improves. Commercial lending represented 53% of the loan portfolio and consumer lending represented 47% at December 31, 2009. Commercial lending declined 17% at December 31, 2009 compared with December 31, 2008. Commercial loans, which comprised 65% of total commercial lending, declined 21% due to reduced demand for new loans, lower utilization levels and paydowns as clients continued to deleverage their balance sheets. Total consumer lending decreased slightly at December 31, 2009 from December 31, 2008.

Total loans in the table above include purchased impaired loans related to National City, adjusted to reflect additional loan impairments effective December 31, 2008, amounting to $10.3 billion, or 7% of total loans, at December 31, 2009 and $12.7 billion, or 7% of total loans, at December 31, 2008. We are committed to providing credit and liquidity to qualified borrowers. Total loan originations and new commitments and renewals totaled $110 billion for 2009, including originations for first mortgages of $19 billion and small business loans of $4 billion. 30 Our loan portfolio continued to be diversified among numerous industries and types of businesses. The loans that we hold are also concentrated in, and diversified across, our principal geographic markets. Commercial lending is the largest category and is the most sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses. We have allocated $3.4 billion, or 66%, of the total allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2009 to these loans. We allocated $1.7 billion, or 34%, of the remaining allowance at that date to consumer lending. This allocation also considers other relevant factors such as: (a) Actual versus estimated losses, (b) Regional and national economic conditions, (c) Business segment and portfolio concentrations, (d) Industry conditions, (e) The impact of government regulations, and (f) Risk of potential estimation or judgmental errors, including the accuracy of risk ratings. Higher Risk Loans Our loan portfolio contains higher risk loans that are more likely to result in credit losses. We established specific and pooled reserves on the total commercial lending category, including higher risk loans, of $3.4 billion at December 31, 2009. This represented approximately two thirds of the total allowance for loan and lease losses of $5.1 billion at that date. The remaining one third of the allowance for loan and lease losses pertained to the total consumer lending category. This category of loans is more homogenous in nature and has certain characteristics that can be assessed at a total portfolio level in terms of loans representing higher risk. We do not consider government insured/government guaranteed loans to be higher risk as we do not believe these loans will result in a significant loss because of their structure. These loans are excluded from the following assessment of higher risk loans. Our home equity lines of credit and installment loans outstanding totaled $35.9 billion at December 31, 2009. In this portfolio, we consider the higher risk loans to be those with a recent FICO credit score of less than or equal to 660 and a loan to value ratio greater than 90%. Such loans totaled $1.2 billion or approximately 3% of the total home equity line and installment loans at December 31, 2009. These higher risk loans were concentrated in our geographic footprint with 28% in Pennsylvania, 14% in Ohio, 11% in New Jersey, 7% in Illinois, 6% Missouri, and 5% in Kentucky, with the remaining loans dispersed across several other states. Option ARM loans and negative amortization loans in this portfolio were not significant. Within the higher risk home equity portfolio, approximately 10% are in some stage of delinquency and 5% are in late stage (90+ days) delinquency status. In our $18.2 billion residential mortgage portfolio, loans with a recent FICO credit score of less than or equal to 660 and a loan to value ratio greater than 90% totaled $.8 billion and comprised approximately 5% of this portfolio at December 31, 2009. Twenty two percent of the higher risk loans are located in California, 13% in Florida, 10% in Illinois, 8% in Maryland, 5% in Pennsylvania, and 5% in New Jersey, with the remaining loans dispersed across several other states. Option ARM loans and negative amortization loans in this portfolio were not significant. Within the higher risk residential mortgage portfolio of $.8 billion, approximately 53% are in some stage of delinquency and 41% are in 90+ days late stage delinquency status. Within our home equity lines of credit, installment loans and residential mortgage portfolios, approximately 5% of the aggregate $54.1 billion loan outstandings at December 31, 2009 have loan to value ratios in excess of 100%. The impact of housing price depreciation is reflected in the allowance for loans and lease losses as a result of the consumer reserve methodology process. The consumer reserve process is sensitive to collateral values which in turn affect loan loss severity. While our consumer reserve methodology strives to reflect all significant risk factors, there is an element of uncertainty associated with, but not limited to, potential imprecision in the estimation process due to the inherent time lag of obtaining information such as housing price depreciation. We provide additional reserves where appropriate to provide coverage for losses attributable to such risks. We obtain updated property values annually for select residential mortgage loan portfolios. We are expanding this valuation process to update the property values on the majority of our real estate secured consumer loan portfolios. Information related to purchased impaired loans, purchase accounting accretion and accretable net interest recognized during 2009 in connection with our acquisition of National City follows. 31 Valuation of FASB ASC 310 30 Purchased Impaired Loans December 31, 2008 (a) December 31, 2009 Dollars in billions Balance Net Investment Balance Net Investment Commercial and commercial real estate loans: Unpaid principal balance $ 6.3 $ 3.5 Purchased impaired mark (3.4 ) (1.3 ) Recorded investment 2.9 2.2 Allowance for loan losses (.2 ) Net investment 2.9 46 % 2.0 57 % Consumer and residential mortgage loans: Unpaid principal balance 15.6 11.7 Purchased impaired mark (5.8 ) (3.6 ) Recorded investment 9.8 8.1 Allowance for loan losses (.3 ) Net investment 9.8 63 % 7.8 67 % Total FASB ASC 310 30 purchased impaired loans: Unpaid principal balance 21.9 15.2 Purchased impaired mark (9.2 )(b) (4.9 )(b) Recorded investment 12.7 10.3 Allowance for loan losses (.5 )(c) Net investment $ 12.7 58 % $ 9.8 64 % (a) Subsequent to December 31, 2008, an additional $2.6 billion of acquired National City loans were identified as impaired under FASB ASC 310 30. A total fair value mark of $1.8 billion was recorded, resulting in a $.8 billion net investment. These impairments were effective December 31, 2008 based on additional information regarding the borrowers and credit conditions that existed as of the acquisition date. (b) Comprised of $5.5 billion of nonaccretable and $3.7 billion of accretable at December 31, 2008 and $1.4 billion of nonaccretable and $3.5 billion of accretable at December 31, 2009. (c) An additional allowance for loan losses of $.5 billion does not recognize the incremental accretable yield of $.9 billion related to certain purchased impaired loans with improving estimated cash flows. This income will be recognized over time. The unpaid principal balance of purchased impaired loans declined from $21.9 billion at December 31, 2008 to $15.2 billion at December 31, 2009 due to amounts determined to be uncollectible, payoffs and disposals. The remaining purchased impaired mark at December 31, 2009 was $4.9 billion and declined from $9.2 billion at December 31, 2008 primarily due to amounts determined to be uncollectible. The net investment of $12.7 billion at December 31, 2008 declined to $9.8 billion at December 31, 2009 primarily due to payoffs, disposals and further impairment partially offset by accretion during 2009. We currently expect to collect total cash flows of $13.8 billion on purchased impaired loans, representing the $10.3 billion recorded investment at December 31, 2009 and the accretable net interest of $3.5 billion shown in the Accretable Net Interest table that follows.

Unfunded liquidity facility commitments and standby bond purchase agreements totaled $6.2 billion at December 31, 2009 and $7.0 billion at December 31, 2008 and are included in the preceding table primarily within the Commercial/commercial real estate category. In addition to credit commitments, our net outstanding standby letters of credit totaled $10.0 billion at December 31, 2009 and $10.3 billion at December 31, 2008. Standby letters of credit commit us to make payments on behalf of our customers if specified future events occur.

The increase in securities of $12.6 billion since December 31, 2008 primarily reflected the purchase of US Treasury and government agency securities as well as price appreciation in the available for sale portfolio, partially offset by maturities, prepayments and sales. 33 We evaluate our portfolio of investment securities in light of changing market conditions and other factors and, where appropriate, take steps intended to improve our overall positioning. Overall, we consider the portfolio to be well diversified and high quality. US Treasury and government agencies, agency residential mortgage backed securities and agency commercial mortgage backed securities collectively represented 59% of the investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, the securities available for sale portfolio included a net unrealized loss of $2.3 billion, which represented the difference between fair value and amortized cost. The comparable amount at December 31, 2008 was a net unrealized loss of $5.4 billion. The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of investment securities generally decreases when interest rates increase and vice versa. In addition, the fair value generally decreases when credit spreads widen and vice versa. The decline in the net unrealized loss from the prior year end was primarily the result of improving fair values in non agency residential mortgage backed and non agency commercial mortgage backed securities. Net unrealized gains and losses in the securities available for sale portfolio are included in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax. Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities do not impact liquidity or risk based capital. However, reductions in the credit ratings of these securities would have an impact on the determination of risk weighted assets which could reduce our regulatory capital ratios. In addition, the amount representing the credit related portion of other than temporary impairments on available for sale securities would reduce our earnings and regulatory capital ratios. The expected weighted average life of investment securities (excluding corporate stocks and other) was 4.1 years at December 31, 2009 and 3.1 years at December 31, 2008. We estimate that at December 31, 2009 the effective duration of investment securities was 2.9 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in interest rates and 2.5 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2008 were 3.7 years and 3.1 years, respectively. 34 The following table provides detail regarding the vintage, current credit rating, and FICO score of the underlying collateral at origination for residential mortgage backed, commercial mortgage backed and other asset backed securities held in the available for sale and held to maturity portfolios: December 31, 2009 Agency Non agency Dollars in millions ResidentialMortgage BackedSecurities CommercialMortgage BackedSecurities ResidentialMortgage BackedSecurities CommercialMortgage BackedSecurities Asset BackedSecurities Fair Value Available for Sale $ 24,438 $ 1,297 $ 8,302 $ 3,848 $ 1,668 Fair Value Held to Maturity 2,225 3,136 Total Fair Value $ 24,438 $ 1,297 $ 8,302 $ 6,073 $ 4,804 % of Fair Value: By Vintage 2009 40 % 73 % 2 % 34 % 2008 17 % 2 % 11 % 2007 9 % 16 % 16 % 17 % 2006 11 % 3 % 23 % 33 % 18 % 2005 and earlier 23 % 22 % 61 % 49 % 20 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % By Credit Rating Agency 100 % 100 % AAA 12 % 91 % 74 % AA 7 % 2 % 5 % A 8 % 3 % BBB 12 % 3 % 1 % BB 16 % 1 % 5 % B 15 % 5 % Lower than B 30 % 8 % No rating 2 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % By FICO Score &gt;720 61 % 4 % &lt;720 and &gt;660 30 % 10 % &lt;660 4 % No FICO score N/A N/A 9 % N/A 82 % Total 100 % 100 % We conduct a comprehensive security level impairment assessment quarterly on all securities in an unrealized loss position to determine whether the loss represents OTTI. Our assessment considers the security structure, recent security collateral performance metrics, external credit ratings, failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments, our judgment and expectations of future performance, and relevant independent industry research, analysis and forecasts. We also consider the severity of the impairment and the length of time that the security has been impaired in our assessment. Results of the periodic assessment are reviewed by a cross functional senior management team representing Asset & Liability Management, Finance, and Balance Sheet Risk Management. The senior management team considers the results of the assessments, as well as other factors, in determining whether the impairment is other than temporary. New US GAAP issued in 2009 amended OTTI guidance for debt securities regarding recognition and disclosure. The major change in the guidance was the requirement to recognize only the credit portion of OTTI charges in current earnings for those debt securities where there is no intent to sell and it is not more likely than not that the entity would be required to sell the security prior to expected recovery. The remaining portion of OTTI charges is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. PNC adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2009. Upon adoption, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $110 million to retained earnings at January 1, 2009 to reclassify the noncredit component of OTTI recognized in 2008 from retained earnings to accumulated other comprehensive loss. During 2009, we recognized OTTI losses of $1.9 billion, of which $577 million represented the credit portion of the losses recognized as a reduction of noninterest income on our Consolidated Income Statement. The remaining noncredit portion of the OTTI losses totaled $1.4 billion and was recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the 35 Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009. Included below is detail on the net unrealized losses and OTTI credit losses recorded on non agency residential and commercial mortgage backed and other asset backed securities, which represent the portfolios that have generated the majority of the OTTI losses. A summary of all OTTI credit losses recognized in 2009 by investment type is included in Note 7 Investment Securities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report.

Residential Mortgage Backed Securities At December 31, 2009, our residential mortgage backed securities portfolio was comprised of $24.4 billion fair value of US government agency backed securities and $8.3 billion fair value of non agency (private issuer) securities. The agency securities are generally collateralized by 1 4 family, conforming, fixed rate residential mortgages. The non agency securities are also generally collateralized by 1 4 family residential mortgages. The mortgage loans underlying the non agency securities are generally non conforming (i.e., original balances in excess of the amount qualifying for agency securities) and predominately have interest rates that are fixed for a period of time, after which the rate adjusts to a floating rate based upon a contractual spread that is indexed to a market rate (i.e., a hybrid ARM), or interest rates that are fixed for the term of the loan. Substantially all of the securities are senior tranches in the securitization structure and have credit protection in the form of credit enhancement, over collateralization and or excess spread accounts. During 2009, we recorded OTTI credit losses of $444 million on non agency residential mortgage backed securities. As of 36 December 31, 2009, $397 million of the credit losses related to securities rated below investment grade. As of December 31, 2009, the noncredit portion of OTTI losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss for non agency residential mortgage backed securities totaled $1.1 billion and the related securities had a fair value of $2.6 billion. The fair value of sub investment grade investment securities for which we have not recorded an OTTI credit loss as of December 31, 2009 totaled $2.6 billion, with unrealized net losses of $658 million. The results of our security level assessments indicate that we will recover the entire cost basis of these securities. Note 7 Investment Securities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report provides further detail regarding our process for assessing OTTI for these securities. Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities The fair value of the non agency commercial mortgage backed securities portfolio was $6.1 billion at December 31, 2009 and consisted of fixed rate, private issuer securities collateralized by non residential properties, primarily retail properties, office buildings, and multi family housing. The agency commercial mortgage backed securities portfolio was $1.3 billion fair value at December 31, 2009 consisting of multi family housing. Substantially all of the securities are the most senior tranches in the subordination structure. We recorded OTTI credit losses of $6 million on non agency commercial mortgage backed securities during 2009. The remaining fair value of the securities for which OTTI was recorded approximates zero. All of the credit impaired securities were rated below investment grade. Asset Backed Securities The fair value of the asset backed securities portfolio was $4.8 billion at December 31, 2009 and consisted of fixed rate and floating rate, private issuer securities collateralized primarily by various consumer credit products, including residential mortgage loans, credit cards, and automobile loans. Substantially all of the securities are senior tranches in the securitization structure and have credit protection in the form of credit enhancement, over collateralization and or excess spread accounts. We recorded OTTI credit losses of $111 million on asset backed securities during 2009. All of the securities were collateralized by first and second lien residential mortgage loans and were rated below investment grade. As of December 31, 2009, the noncredit portion of OTTI losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss for asset backed securities totaled $221 million and the related securities had a fair value of $562 million. For the sub investment grade investment securities for which we have not recorded an OTTI loss through December 31, 2009, the remaining fair value was $381 million, with unrealized net losses of $110 million. The results of our security level assessments indicate that we will recover the entire cost basis of these securities. Note 7 Investment Securities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report provides further detail regarding our process for assessing OTTI for these securities. If the current housing and economic conditions were to continue for the foreseeable future or worsen, if market volatility and illiquidity were to continue or worsen, or if market interest rates were to increase appreciably, the valuation of our investment securities portfolio could continue to be adversely affected and we could incur additional OTTI credit losses that would impact our Consolidated Income Statement.

For commercial mortgages held for sale carried at the lower of cost or market, strong origination volumes partially offset sales to government agencies of $5.4 billion during 2009. We recognized net gains of $107 million in 2009 on the valuation and sale of commercial mortgage loans held for sale, net of hedges, carried at fair value and lower of cost or market compared with losses of $197 million in 2008. We sold $.3 billion and $.6 billion, respectively, of commercial mortgage loans held for sale carried at fair value in 2009 and 2008. Residential mortgage loans held for sale decreased during 2009 despite strong refinancing volumes, especially in the first quarter. Loan origination volume was $19.1 billion. Substantially all such loans were originated to agency standards. We sold $19.8 billion of loans and recognized related gains of $435 million during 2009. Net interest income on residential mortgage loans held for sale was $332 million for 2009. 37 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill increased $637 million and other intangible assets increased $584 million at December 31, 2009 compared with December 31, 2008. Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 9 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report have further details on the National City related items that were the primary drivers of these increases. FUNDING AND CAPITAL SOURCES Details Of Funding Sources In millions Dec. 31 2009 Dec. 31 2008 Deposits Money market $ 85,838 $ 77,889 Demand 40,406 33,001 Retail certificates of deposit 48,622 58,315 Savings 6,401 6,056 Other time 1,088 13,620 Time deposits in foreign offices 4,567 3,984 Total deposits 186,922 192,865 Borrowed funds Federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements 3,998 5,153 Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings 10,761 18,126 Bank notes and senior debt 12,362 13,664 Subordinated debt 9,907 11,208 Other 2,233 4,089 Total borrowed funds 39,261 52,240 Total $ 226,183 $ 245,105 Total funding sources decreased $18.9 billion at December 31, 2009 compared with December 31, 2008 driven by declines in other time deposits, retail certificates of deposit and Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, partially offset by increases in money market and demand deposits. Total deposits decreased $5.9 billion at December 31, 2009 compared with December 31, 2008. Relationship growth driven increases in money market, demand and savings deposits were more than offset by declines in other time deposits, reflecting a planned run off of brokered certificates of deposits, and non relationship retail certificates of deposits. We anticipate that growth in relationship based deposits will be offset by additional run off of higher cost retail time deposits in 2010. Interest bearing deposits represented 76% of total deposits at December 31, 2009 compared with 81% at December 31, 2008. The $13.0 billion decline in borrowed funds since December 31, 2008 primarily resulted from repayments of Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings along with decreases in all other borrowed fund categories. In March 2009, PNC issued $1.0 billion of floating rate senior notes guaranteed by the FDIC under the TLGP. In addition, PNC issued $1.5 billion of senior notes during the second and third quarters of 2009, which were not issued under the TLGP. The Liquidity Risk Management section of this Item 7 contains further details regarding actions we have taken which impacted our borrowed funds balances in 2009. In February 2010, PNC issued $2.0 billion of senior notes as described further in the Liquidity Risk Management section of this Item 7. Capital We manage our capital position by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing debt, equity or hybrid instruments, executing treasury stock transactions, managing dividend policies and retaining earnings. On March 1, 2009, we took the proactive step to build capital and further strengthen our balance sheet when the Board of Directors decided to reduce PNCs quarterly common stock dividend from $0.66 to $0.10 per share. The reduction added $766 million in 2009, and is expected to add approximately $1 billion on an annualized basis, to PNCs common equity and cash positions, resulting in annual improvement in capital ratios of approximately 40 basis points. Total shareholders equity increased $4.5 billion, to $29.9 billion, at December 31, 2009 compared with December 31, 2008 primarily due to the following: A decline of $2.0 billion in accumulated other comprehensive loss primarily as a result of decreases in net unrealized securities losses as more fully described in the Investment Securities portion of this Consolidated Balance Sheet Review, An increase of $1.7 billion in retained earnings, and An increase of $.6 billion in capital surplus common stock and other, primarily due to the May 2009 common stock issuance. Common shares outstanding were 462 million at December 31, 2009 and 443 million at December 31, 2008. As described in the Executive Summary section of this Item 7, in May 2009 we raised $624 million in new common equity through the issuance of 15 million shares of common stock. The offering was related to our plan for increasing common equity following the results of the stress tests conducted under the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the OCC. We expect to continue to increase our common equity as a proportion of total capital through growth in retained earnings and will consider other capital opportunities as appropriate. See Repurchase of Outstanding TARP Preferred Stock in the Executive Summary section and information regarding our February 2010 common stock offering in the Liquidity Risk Management section of this Report. Our current common stock repurchase program permits us to purchase up to 25 million shares of PNC common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. This 38 program will remain in effect until fully utilized or until modified, superseded or terminated. The extent and timing of share repurchases under this program will depend on a number of factors including, among others, market and general economic conditions, economic and regulatory capital considerations, alternative uses of capital, regulatory and contractual limitations, and the potential impact on our credit ratings. We did not purchase any shares during 2009 under this program.

They have also stated their view that common equity should be the dominant form of Tier 1 capital. As a result, regulators are now emphasizing the Tier 1 common capital ratio in their evaluation of bank holding company capital levels, although this metric is not provided for in the regulations. We seek to manage our capital consistent with these regulatory principles, and believe that our year end capital levels were aligned with them. Actions that we have taken since year end that increase our Tier 1 common capital ratio on a pro forma basis are described below. Capital levels were strengthened during 2009. Higher capital levels were net of dividend payments including $332 million paid to the US Department of the Treasury during 2009 on $7.6 billion of preferred stock. See Repurchase of Outstanding TARP Preferred Stock and Pending Sale of PNC Global Investment Servicing in the Executive Summary section of Item 7. Our Tier 1 risk based capital ratio and our Tier 1 common capital ratio would have been 10.3% and 8.0%, respectively, at December 31, 2009 had they included the estimated net impact of the redemption of the outstanding TARP preferred stock, our February 2010 equity offering discussed further in the Liquidity Risk Management section of Item 7, and the pending sale of GIS. We provide a reconciliation of these ratios reflecting the impact of the TARP redemption, common equity offering and sale of GIS to the ratios set forth in the Risk Based Capital table above in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section in Item 8 of this Report. PNCs Tier 1 risk based capital ratio increased by 170 basis points to 11.4% at December 31, 2009 from 9.7% at December 31, 2008. The increase in the ratio was due to higher risk based capital primarily from retained earnings and the May 2009 common equity issuance coupled with a decline in risk weighted assets. Our Tier 1 common capital ratio was 6.0% at December 31, 2009 compared with 4.8% at December 31, 2008. The leverage ratio at December 31, 2008 reflected the favorable impact on Tier 1 risk based capital from the issuance of securities under TARP and the issuance of PNC common stock in connection with the National City acquisition, both of which occurred on December 31, 2008. In addition, the ratio as of that date did not reflect any impact of National City on PNCs adjusted average total assets. The access to, and cost of, funding new business initiatives including acquisitions, the ability to engage in expanded business activities, the ability to pay dividends, the level of deposit insurance costs, and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend, in part, on a financial institutions capital strength. We merged the charter of PNC Bank Delaware into PNC Bank, N.A. during August 2009 and merged the charter of National City Bank into PNC Bank, N.A. in November 2009. 39 At December 31, 2009, PNC Bank, N.A., our domestic bank subsidiary, was considered well capitalized based on US regulatory capital ratio requirements. See the Supervision And Regulation section of Item 1 of this Report and Note 23 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. We believe PNC Bank, N.A. will continue to meet these requirements during 2010. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND VIES We engage in a variety of activities that involve unconsolidated entities including qualified special purpose entities (QSPEs) or that are otherwise not reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet that are generally referred to as off balance sheet arrangements. The following sections of this Report provide further information on these types of activities: Commitments, including contractual obligations and other commitments, included within the Risk Management section of this Item 7, and Note 10 Loan Sales and Securitizations and Note 25 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. The following provides a summary of variable interest entities (VIEs), including those that we have consolidated and those in which we hold a significant variable interest but have not consolidated into our financial statements as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. Consolidated VIEs PNC Is Primary Beneficiary In millions Aggregate Assets AggregateLiabilities Tax credit investments (a) December 31, 2009 $ 1,933 $ 808 December 31, 2008 $ 1,690 $ 921 Credit Risk Transfer Transaction December 31, 2009 $ 860 $ 860 December 31, 2008 $ 1,070 $ 1,070 (a) Amounts reported primarily represent investments in low income housing projects. Impact of New Accounting Guidance in 2010 We transfer loans to QSPEs sponsored by PNC or third parties in connection with loan sales and securitization transactions. These transactions effectively transfer the risk to the QSPE and permit the loans to be excluded from our Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 10 Loan Sales and Securitizations included in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. The FASB issued guidance during 2009 that removes the nonconsolidation exception for QSPEs and includes new criteria for determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The guidance also increases the frequency of required reassessments to determine whether an entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE and requires enhanced disclosures. We adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2010. Based on the new guidance, we consolidated Market Street effective January 1, 2010. Accordingly, we recognized the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests of Market Street on our Consolidated Balance Sheet based on their respective carrying amounts as prescribed by the guidance. We also consolidated the QSPE associated with the securitization of credit card loans effective January 1, 2010. These changes had a minimal impact on our capital ratios. We are continuing to analyze other entities, including non PNC sponsored securitization trusts where we provide loan servicing, for possible consolidation of the trusts. The impact on total assets of adopting this new accounting standard on January 1, 2010 for those VIEs that were consolidated is as follows: In millions Incremental Assets Market Street $ 2,486 Credit card loans 1,480 Total $ 3,966 Non Consolidated VIEs Significant Variable Interests In millions AggregateAssets AggregateLiabilities PNC Risk of Loss December 31, 2009 Market Street $ 3,698 $ 3,718 $ 6,155 (a) Tax credit investments (b) (c) 1,786 1,156 743 Collateralized debt obligations 23 2 Total $ 5,507 $ 4,874 $ 6,900 December 31, 2008 Market Street $ 4,916 $ 5,010 $ 6,965 (a) Tax credit investments (b) (c) 1,517 1,041 811 Collateralized debt obligations 20 2 Total $ 6,453 $ 6,051 $ 7,778 (a) PNCs risk of loss consists of off balance sheet liquidity commitments to Market Street of $5.6 billion and other credit enhancements of $.6 billion at December 31, 2009.

(c) Aggregate assets and aggregate liabilities represent estimated balances due to limited availability of financial information associated with certain acquired National City partnerships. Market Street Market Street is a multi seller asset backed commercial paper conduit that is owned by an independent third party. Market Streets activities primarily involve purchasing assets or making loans secured by interests in pools of receivables from US corporations that desire access to the commercial paper market. Market Street funds the purchases of assets or loans by issuing commercial paper which has been rated A1/P1/F1 by Standard & Poors, Moodys, and Fitch, respectively, and is supported by pool specific credit enhancements, liquidity facilities and program level credit enhancement. Generally, 40 Market Street mitigates its potential interest rate risk by entering into agreements with its borrowers that reflect interest rates based upon its weighted average commercial paper cost of funds. During 2008 and 2009, Market Street met all of its funding needs through the issuance of commercial paper. Market Street commercial paper outstanding was $3.1 billion at December 31, 2009 and $4.4 billion at December 31, 2008. The weighted average maturity of the commercial paper was 36 days at December 31, 2009 and 24 days at December 31, 2008. Effective October 28, 2008, Market Street was approved to participate in the Federal Reserves CPFF authorized under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. The CPFF commitment to purchase up to $5.4 billion of three month Market Street commercial paper expired on February 1, 2010. Market Street had no borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2009 or during the year then ended. During 2009, PNC Capital Markets, acting as a placement agent for Market Street, held a maximum daily position in Market Street commercial paper of $135 million with an average balance of $19 million. This compares with a maximum daily position of $75 million with an average balance of $12 million during 2008. PNC Capital Markets owned no Market Street commercial paper at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. PNC Bank, N.A. made no purchases of Market Street commercial paper during 2009. PNC Bank, N.A. provides certain administrative services, the program level credit enhancement and all of the liquidity facilities to Market Street in exchange for fees negotiated based on market rates. Program administrator fees related to PNCs portion of liquidity facilities were $43 million for 2009 and $21 million for 2008. Commitment fees related to PNCs portion of the liquidity facilities for 2009 and 2008 were insignificant. The commercial paper obligations at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 were effectively collateralized by Market Streets assets. While PNC may be obligated to fund under the $5.6 billion of liquidity facilities for events such as commercial paper market disruptions, borrower bankruptcies, collateral deficiencies or covenant violations, our credit risk under the liquidity facilities is secondary to the risk of first loss provided by the borrower or another third party in the form of deal specific credit enhancement, such as by the over collateralization of the assets. Deal specific credit enhancement that supports the commercial paper issued by Market Street is generally structured to cover a multiple of expected losses for the pool of assets and is sized to generally meet rating agency standards for comparably structured transactions. In addition, PNC would be required to fund $.4 billion of the liquidity facilities if the underlying assets are in default. See Note 25 Commitments And Guarantees included in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report for additional information. PNC provides program level credit enhancement to cover net losses in the amount of 10% of commitments, excluding explicitly rated AAA/Aaa facilities. PNC provides 100% of the enhancement in the form of a cash collateral account funded by a loan facility. This facility expires in March 2013. Market Street has entered into a Subordinated Note Purchase Agreement (Note) with an unrelated third party. The Note provides first loss coverage whereby the investor absorbs losses up to the amount of the Note, which was $8.0 million as of December 31, 2009. Proceeds from the issuance of the Note are held by Market Street in a first loss reserve account that will be used to reimburse any losses incurred by Market Street, PNC Bank, N.A. or other providers under the liquidity facilities and the credit enhancement arrangements.

All facilities are structured to meet rating agency standards for applicable rating levels. We evaluated the design of Market Street, its capital structure, the Note, and relationships among the variable interest holders. Based on this analysis and under accounting guidance effective during 2009 and 2008, we are not the primary beneficiary and therefore the assets and liabilities of Market Street are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We considered changes to the variable interest holders (such as new expected loss note investors and changes to program level credit enhancement providers), terms of expected loss notes, and new types of risks related to Market Street as reconsideration events. We reviewed the activities of Market Street on at least a quarterly basis to determine if a reconsideration event has occurred. Tax Credit Investments We make certain equity investments in various limited partnerships or limited liability companies (LLCs) that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) pursuant to Sections 42 and 47 of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital, to facilitate the sale of additional affordable housing product offerings and to assist us in achieving goals associated with the Community Reinvestment Act. The primary activities of the investments include the identification, development and operation of multi family housing that is leased to qualifying residential tenants. Generally, these types of investments are funded through a combination of debt and equity. We typically invest in these partnerships as a limited partner or non managing member. Also, we are a national syndicator of affordable housing equity (together with the investments described above, the LIHTC investments). In these syndication transactions, we create funds in which our subsidiaries are the general partner or managing member and sell limited partnership or non managing member interests to third parties, and in some cases may also purchase a limited partnership or non managing member interest in the fund. The purpose of this business is to generate income from the syndication of these funds, generate servicing fees by managing the funds, and earn tax credits to reduce our tax liability. General partner or managing member activities include selecting, evaluating, structuring, negotiating, and closing the fund investments in operating limited partnerships, as well as oversight of the ongoing operations of the fund portfolio. We evaluate our interests and third party interests in the limited partnerships/LLCs in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary determination is based on which party absorbs a majority of the variability. The primary sources of variability in LIHTC investments are the tax credits, tax benefits due to passive losses on the investments and development and operating cash flows. We have consolidated LIHTC investments in which we absorb a majority of the variability and thus are considered the primary beneficiary. The assets are primarily included in Equity investments and Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet with the liabilities classified in Other liabilities and third party investors interests included in the Equity section as Noncontrolling interests. Neither creditors nor equity investors in the LIHTC investments have any recourse to our general credit. The consolidated aggregate assets and liabilities of these LIHTC investments are provided in the Consolidated VIEs PNC Is Primary Beneficiary table and reflected in the Other business segment. We also have LIHTC investments in which we are not the primary beneficiary, but are considered to have a significant variable interest based on our interests in the partnership/LLC. These investments are disclosed in the Non Consolidated VIEs Significant Variable Interests table. The table also reflects our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum exposure to loss is equal to our legally binding equity commitments adjusted for recorded impairment and partnership results. We use the equity and cost methods to account for our investment in these entities with the investments reflected in Equity investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. In addition, we increase our recognized investments and recognize a liability for all legally binding unfunded equity commitments. These liabilities are reflected in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Credit Risk Transfer Transaction National City Bank, (a former PNC subsidiary which merged into PNC Bank, N.A. in November 2009) sponsored a special purpose entity (SPE) and concurrently entered into a credit risk transfer agreement with an independent third party to mitigate credit losses on a pool of nonconforming mortgage loans originated by its former First Franklin business unit. The SPE was formed with a small equity contribution and was structured as a bankruptcy remote entity so that its creditors have no recourse to us. In exchange for a perfected security interest in the cash flows of the nonconforming mortgage loans, the SPE issued to us asset backed securities in the form of senior, mezzanine, and subordinated equity notes. The SPE was deemed to be a VIE as its equity was not sufficient to finance its activities. We were determined to be the primary beneficiary of the SPE as we would absorb the majority of the expected losses of the SPE through our holding of the asset backed securities. Accordingly, this SPE was consolidated and all of the entitys assets, liabilities, and 42 equity associated with the note tranches held by us are intercompany balances and are eliminated in consolidation. Nonconforming mortgage loans, including foreclosed properties, pledged as collateral to the SPE remain on the balance sheet at a net carrying value of $587 million at December 31, 2009. In connection with the credit risk transfer agreement, we held the right to put the mezzanine notes to the independent third party once credit losses in the mortgage loan pool exceeded the principal balance of the subordinated equity notes. During 2009, cumulative credit losses in the mortgage loan pool surpassed the principal balance of the subordinated equity notes which resulted in us exercising our put option on two of the subordinate mezzanine notes. Cash proceeds received from the third party for the exercise of these put options totaled $36 million. In addition, during 2009 we entered into an agreement with the third party to terminate each partys rights and obligations under the credit risk transfer agreement for the remaining mezzanine notes. We agreed to terminate our contractual right to put the remaining mezzanine notes to the third party for a cash payment of $126 million. A pretax gain of $10 million was recognized in noninterest income as a result of these transactions. We assessed what impact the reconsideration events above had on determining whether we would remain the primary beneficiary of the SPE. Management concluded that we would remain the primary beneficiary and accordingly should continue to consolidate the SPE. Perpetual Trust Securities We issue certain hybrid capital vehicles that qualify as capital for regulatory and rating agency purposes. In February 2008, PNC Preferred Funding LLC (the LLC), one of our indirect subsidiaries, sold $375 million of 8.700% Fixed to Floating Rate Non Cumulative Exchangeable Perpetual Trust Securities of PNC Preferred Funding Trust III (Trust III) to third parties in a private placement. In connection with the private placement, Trust III acquired $375 million of Fixed to Floating Rate Non Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Securities of the LLC (the LLC Preferred Securities). The sale was similar to the March 2007 private placement by the LLC of $500 million of 6.113% Fixed to Floating Rate Non Cumulative Exchangeable Trust Securities (the Trust II Securities) of PNC Preferred Funding Trust II (Trust II) in which Trust II acquired $500 million of LLC Preferred Securities and to the December 2006 private placement by PNC REIT Corp. of $500 million of 6.517% Fixed to Floating Rate Non Cumulative Exchangeable Perpetual Trust Securities (the Trust I Securities) of PNC Preferred Funding Trust I (Trust I) in which Trust I acquired $500 million of LLC Preferred Securities. Each Trust III Security is automatically exchangeable into a share of Series J Non Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of PNC, each Trust II Security is automatically exchangeable into a share of Series I Non Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of PNC (Series I Preferred Stock), and each Trust I Security is automatically exchangeable into a share of Series F Non Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of PNC Bank, N.A. (PNC Bank Preferred Stock), in each case under certain conditions relating to the capitalization or the financial condition of PNC Bank, N.A. and upon the direction of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. We entered into a replacement capital covenant in connection with the closing of the Trust I Securities sale (the Trust RCC) whereby we agreed that neither we nor our subsidiaries (other than PNC Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries) would purchase the Trust Securities, the LLC Preferred Securities or the PNC Bank Preferred Stock unless such repurchases or redemptions are made from the proceeds of the issuance of certain qualified securities and pursuant to the other terms and conditions set forth in the replacement capital covenant with respect to the Trust RCC. We also entered into a replacement capital covenant in connection with the closing of the Trust II Securities sale (the Trust II RCC) whereby we agreed until March 29, 2017 that neither we nor our subsidiaries would purchase or redeem the Trust II Securities, the LLC Preferred Securities or the Series I Preferred Stock unless such repurchases or redemptions are made from the proceeds of the issuance of certain qualified securities and pursuant to the other terms and conditions set forth in the replacement capital covenant with respect to the Trust RCC. As of December 31, 2009, each of the Trust RCC and the Trust II RCC are for the benefit of holders of our $200 million of Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Notes issued in June 1998. We filed a copy of each of the Trust RCC and the Trust II RCC with the SEC as Exhibit 99.1 to PNCs Form 8 K filed on December 8, 2006 and as Exhibit 99.1 to PNCs Form 8 K filed on March 30, 2007, respectively. PNC has contractually committed to Trust II and Trust III that if full dividends are not paid in a dividend period on the Trust II Securities or the Trust III Securities, as applicable, or the LLC Preferred Securities held by Trust II or Trust III, as applicable, PNC will not declare or pay dividends with respect to, or redeem, purchase or acquire, any of its equity capital securities during the next succeeding dividend period, other than: (i) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of capital stock of PNC in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants, (ii) purchases of shares of common stock of PNC pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy stock existing prior to the commencement of the extension period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan, (iii) any dividend in connection with the implementation of a shareholders rights plan, or the redemption or repurchase of any rights under any such plan, (iv) as a result of an exchange or conversion of any class or series of PNCs capital stock for 43 any other class or series of PNCs capital stock, (v) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of PNC capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such stock or the security being converted or exchanged or (vi) any stock dividends paid by PNC where the dividend stock is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid. PNC Bank, N.A. has contractually committed to Trust I that if full dividends are not paid in a dividend period on the Trust I Securities, LLC Preferred Securities or any other parity equity securities issued by the LLC, neither PNC Bank, N.A. nor its subsidiaries will declare or pay dividends or other distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase or acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its equity capital securities during the next succeeding period (other than to holders of the LLC Preferred Securities and any parity equity securities issued by the LLC) except: (i) in the case of dividends payable to subsidiaries of PNC Bank, N.A., to PNC Bank, N.A. or another wholly owned subsidiary of PNC Bank, N.A. or (ii) in the case of dividends payable to persons that are not subsidiaries of PNC Bank, N.A., to such persons only if, (A) in the case of a cash dividend, PNC has first irrevocably committed to contribute amounts at least equal to such cash dividend or (B) in the case of in kind dividends payable by PNC REIT Corp., PNC has committed to purchase such in kind dividend from the applicable PNC REIT Corp. holders in exchange for a cash payment representing the market value of such in kind dividend, and PNC has committed to contribute such in kind dividend to PNC Bank, N.A. PNC Capital Trust E Trust Preferred Securities In February 2008, PNC Capital Trust E issued $450 million of 7.75% Trust Preferred Securities due March 15, 2068 (the Trust E Securities). PNC Capital Trust Es only assets are $450 million of 7.75% Junior Subordinated Notes due March 15, 2068 and issued by PNC (the JSNs). The Trust E Securities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by PNC. We may, at our option, redeem the JSNs at 100% of their principal amount on or after March 15, 2013. In connection with the closing of the Trust E Securities sale, we agreed that, if we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments on the JSNs or a related deferral period is continuing, then PNC would be subject during such period to restrictions on dividends and other provisions protecting the status of the JSN debenture holder similar to or in some ways more restrictive than those potentially imposed under the Exchange Agreements with Trust II and Trust III, as described above. PNC Capital Trusts C and D have similar protective provisions with respect to $500 million in principal amount of junior subordinated debentures. Also, in connection with the closing of the Trust E Securities sale, we entered into a replacement capital covenant, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 99.1 to PNCs Form 8 K filed on February 13, 2008 and which is described in Note 14 Capital Securities of Subsidiary Trusts in Item 8 of this Report. Acquired Entity Trust Preferred Securities As a result of the National City acquisition, we assumed obligations with respect to $2.4 billion in principal amount of junior subordinated debentures issued by the acquired entity. As a result of the Mercantile, Yardville and Sterling acquisitions, we assumed obligations with respect to $158 million in principal amount of junior subordinated debentures issued by the acquired entities. Under the terms of these debentures, if there is an event of default under the debentures or PNC exercises its right to defer payments on the related trust preferred securities issued by the statutory trusts or there is a default under PNCs guarantee of such payment obligations, PNC would be subject during the period of such default or deferral to restrictions on dividends and other provisions protecting the status of the debenture holders similar to or in some ways more restrictive than those potentially imposed under the Exchange Agreements with Trust II and Trust III, as described above. We are subject to replacement capital covenants (RCCs) with respect to four tranches of junior subordinated debentures inherited from National City, copies of which RCCs were attached, respectively, as Exhibit 99.2 to the National City Form 8 K filed on February 4, 2008 and Exhibit 99.1 to the National City Forms 8 K filed on November 9, 2006, May 25, 2007 and August 30, 2007. See Note 14 Capital Securities of Subsidiary Trusts. Similarly, we are subject to a replacement capital covenant with respect to our Series L Preferred Stock, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 99.1 to National Citys Form 8 K filed on February 4, 2008. See Note 19 Equity in Item 8 of this Report. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND FAIR VALUE OPTION In addition to the following, see Note 8 Fair Value in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this Report for further information regarding fair value. New GAAP was issued in 2009 for estimating fair values when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased. It also provides guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly. As permitted, PNC adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2009. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including instruments for which PNC has elected the fair value option, are summarized below. As prescribed by GAAP, the assets and liabilities acquired from National City on December 31, 2008 are excluded from the following disclosures as of that date, but are included as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, assets recorded at fair value represented 23% of total assets and fair value liabilities represented 2% of total liabilities compared with 13% of total assets and 2% of total liabilities as of December 31, 2008. 44 Fair Value Measurements Summary December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 (j) In millions Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total FairValue Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total FairValue Assets Securities available for sale $ 7,256 $ 33,609 $ 9,933 $ 50,798 $ 347 $ 21,633 $ 4,837 $ 26,817 Financial derivatives (a) 27 3,839 50 3,916 16 5,582 125 5,723 Residential mortgage loans held for sale (b) 1,012 1,012 Trading securities (c) 1,736 299 89 2,124 89 529 73 691 Residential mortgage servicing rights (d) 1,332 1,332 6 6 Commercial mortgage loans held for sale (b) 1,050 1,050 1,400 1,400 Equity investments 1,188 1,188 571 571 Customer resale agreements (e) 990 990 1,072 1,072 Loans (f) 107 107 Other assets (g) 207 509 716 144 144 Total assets $ 9,019 $ 40,063 $ 14,151 $ 63,233 $ 452 $ 28,960 $ 7,012 $ 36,424 Liabilities Financial derivatives (h) $ 2 $ 3,331 $ 295 $ 3,628 $ 2 $ 4,387 $ 22 $ 4,411 Trading securities sold short (i) 1,302 42 1,344 182 207 389 Other liabilities 6 6 9 9 Total liabilities $ 1,304 $ 3,379 $ 295 $ 4,978 $ 184 $ 4,603 $ 22 $ 4,809 (a) Included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(i) Included in other borrowed funds on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. (j) Excludes assets and liabilities associated with the acquisition of National City. Valuation Hierarchy The following is an outline of the valuation methodologies used for measuring fair value for the major items above. GAAP focuses on the exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants and establishes a reporting hierarchy to maximize the use of observable inputs. The fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3) is described in detail in Note 8 Fair Value in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this Report. We characterize active markets as those where transaction volumes are sufficient to provide objective pricing information, with reasonably narrow bid/ask spreads and where dealer quotes received do not vary widely and are based on current information. Inactive markets are typically characterized by low transaction volumes, price quotations which vary substantially among market participants or are not based on current information, wide bid/ask spreads, a significant increase in implied liquidity risk premiums, yields, or performance indicators for observed transactions or quoted prices compared to historical periods, a significant decline or absence of a market for new issuance, or any combination of the above factors. We also consider nonperformance risks including credit risk as part of our valuation methodology for all assets and liabilities measured at fair value. Any models used to determine fair values or to validate dealer quotes based on the descriptions below are subject to review and independent testing as part of our model validation and internal control testing processes. Our Model Validation Committee tests significant models on at least an annual basis. In addition, we have teams, independent of the traders, verify marks and assumptions used for valuations at each period end. Securities Available for Sale and Trading Securities Securities measured at fair value include both the available for sale and trading portfolios. We use prices obtained from pricing services, dealer quotes or recent trades to determine the fair value of securities. Approximately 60% of our positions are valued using prices obtained from pricing services provided by the Barclays Capital Index, formerly known as the Lehman Index, and Interactive Data Corp. (IDC). For approximately 15% or more of our positions, we use prices obtained from the pricing services as the primary input into the valuation process. Barclays Capital Index prices are set with reference to market activity for highly liquid assets such as agency mortgage backed securities, and matrix pricing for other assets, such as CMBS and asset 45 backed securities. IDC primarily uses pricing models considering adjustments for ratings, spreads, matrix pricing and prepayments for the instruments we value using this service, such as non agency residential mortgage backed securities, agency adjustable rate mortgage securities, agency CMOs and municipal bonds. Dealer quotes received are typically non binding and corroborated with other dealers quotes, by reviewing valuations of comparable instruments, or by comparison to internal valuations. In circumstances where relevant market prices are limited or unavailable, valuations may require significant management judgments or adjustments to determine fair value. In these cases, the securities are classified as Level 3. The valuation techniques used for securities classified as Level 3 include using a discounted cash flow approach or, in certain instances, identifying a proxy security, market transaction or index. For certain security types, primarily non agency residential securities, the fair value methodology incorporates values obtained from a discounted cash flow model. The modeling process incorporates assumptions management believes willing market participants would use to value the security under current market conditions. The assumptions used include prepayment projections, credit loss assumptions, and discount rates, which include a risk premium due to liquidity and uncertainty that are based on both observable and unobservable inputs. We use the discounted cash flow analysis, in conjunction with other relevant pricing information obtained from either pricing services or broker quotes to establish the fair value that management believes is representative under current market conditions. For purposes of determining fair value at December 31, 2009, the relevant pricing service information was the predominant input. In the proxy approach, the proxy selected generally has similar credit, tenor, duration, pricing and structuring attributes to the PNC position. The price, market spread, or yield on the proxy is then used to calculate an indicative market price for the security. Depending on the nature of the PNC position and its attributes relative to the proxy, management may make additional adjustments to account for market conditions, liquidity, and nonperformance risk, based on various inputs including recent trades of similar securities, single dealer quotes, and or other observable and unobservable inputs. Financial Derivatives Exchange traded derivatives are valued using quoted market prices and are classified as Level 1. However, the majority of derivatives that we enter into are executed over the counter and are valued using internal techniques. Readily observable market inputs to these models can be validated to external sources, including industry pricing services, or corroborated through recent trades, dealer quotes, yield curves, implied volatility or other market related data. Certain derivatives, such as total rate of return swaps, are corroborated to the CMBX index. These derivatives are classified as Level 2. Derivatives priced using significant management judgment or assumptions are classified as Level 3. The fair values of our derivatives are adjusted for nonperformance risk including credit risk as appropriate. Our nonperformance risk adjustment is computed using new loan pricing and considers externally available bond spreads, in conjunction with internal historical recovery observations. The credit risk adjustment is not currently material to the overall derivatives valuation. Residential Mortgage Loans Held for Sale We account for residential mortgage loans originated for sale on a recurring basis at fair value. Residential mortgage loans are valued based on quoted market prices, where available, prices for other traded mortgage loans with similar characteristics, and purchase commitments and bid information received from market participants. These loans are regularly traded in active markets and observable pricing information is available from market participants. The prices are adjusted as necessary to include the embedded servicing value in the loans and to take into consideration the specific characteristics of certain loans that are priced based on the pricing of similar loans. These adjustments represent unobservable inputs to the valuation but are not considered significant to the fair value of the loans. Accordingly, residential mortgage loans held for sale are classified as Level 2. Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights Residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) are carried at fair value on a recurring basis. These residential MSRs do not trade in an active open market with readily observable prices. Although sales of servicing assets do occur, the precise terms and conditions typically would not be available. Accordingly, management determines the fair value of its residential MSRs using a discounted cash flow model incorporating assumptions about loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs, and other economic factors. As part of the pricing process, management compares its fair value estimates to third party valuations on a quarterly basis to assess the reasonableness of the fair values calculated by its internal valuation models. Due to the nature of the valuation inputs, residential MSRs are classified as Level 3. Commercial Mortgage Loans Held for Sale We account for certain commercial mortgage loans classified as held for sale at fair value. The election of the fair value option aligns the accounting for the commercial mortgages with the related hedges. At origination, these loans were intended for securitization. Due to inactivity in the CMBS securitization market in 2009 and 2008, we determine the fair value of commercial mortgage loans held for sale by using a whole loan methodology. Fair value is determined using assumptions that management believes a market participant would use in 46 pricing the loans. When available, valuation assumptions included observable inputs based on whole loan sales. Adjustments are made to these assumptions to account for situations when uncertainties exist, including market conditions and liquidity. Credit risk is included as part of our valuation process for these loans by considering expected rates of return for market participants for similar loans in the marketplace. Based on the significance of unobservable inputs, we classify this portfolio as Level 3. Equity Investments The valuation of direct and indirect private equity investments requires significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long term nature of such investments. The carrying values of direct and affiliated partnership interests reflect the expected exit price and are based on various techniques including publicly traded price, multiples of adjusted earnings of the entity, independent appraisals, anticipated financing and sale transactions with third parties, or the pricing used to value the entity in a recent financing transaction. In September 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009 12 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820) Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent). Based on the guidance, we value indirect investments in private equity funds based on net asset value as provided in the financial statements that we receive from their managers. Due to the time lag in our receipt of the financial information and based on a review of investments and valuation techniques applied, adjustments to the manager provided value are made when available recent portfolio company information or market information indicates a significant change in value from that provided by the manager of the fund. These investments are classified as Level 3. Customer Resale Agreements We account for structured resale agreements, which are economically hedged using free standing financial derivatives, at fair value. The fair value for structured resale agreements is determined using a model which includes observable market data such as interest rates as inputs. Readily observable market inputs to this model can be validated to external sources, including yield curves, implied volatility or other market related data. These instruments are classified as Level 2. BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock Effective February 27, 2009, we elected to account for the approximately 2.9 million shares of the BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock received in a stock exchange with BlackRock at fair value. The Series C Preferred Stock economically hedges the BlackRock LTIP liability that is accounted for as a derivative. The fair value of the Series C Preferred Stock is determined using a third party modeling approach, which includes both observable and unobservable inputs. This approach considers expectations of a default/liquidation event and the use of liquidity discounts based on our inability to sell the security at a fair, open market price in a timely manner. Due to the significance of unobservable inputs, this security is classified as Level 3. Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Financial instruments are considered Level 3 when their values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.

Total securities measured at fair value and classified in Level 3 at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 included securities available for sale and trading securities consisting primarily of non agency residential mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities where management determined that the volume and level of activity for these assets had significantly decreased. There have been no recent new private label issues in the residential mortgage backed securities market. The lack of relevant market activity for these securities resulted in management modifying its valuation methodology for the instruments transferred in 2009. Other Level 3 assets include certain commercial mortgage loans held for sale, certain equity securities, auction rate securities, corporate debt securities, private equity investments, residential mortgage servicing rights and other assets. 47 BUSINESS SEGMENTS REVIEW In the first quarter of 2009, we made changes to our business organization structure and management reporting in conjunction with the acquisition of National City. Business segment results for 2008 have been reclassified to reflect current methodologies and current business and management structure and to present prior periods on the same basis. As a result of its pending sale, GIS is no longer a reportable business segment. Results for 2009 for all of our business segments except BlackRock include revenues and expenses associated with businesses acquired with National City. Business segment results, including inter segment revenues, and a description of each business are included in Note 27 Segment Reporting included in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report. Certain revenue and expense amounts included in this Item 7 differ from the amounts shown in Note 27 primarily due to the presentation in this Item 7 of business net interest revenue on a taxable equivalent basis. Results of individual businesses are presented based on our management accounting practices and management structure. There is no comprehensive, authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the financial results of our individual businesses are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company. We refine our methodologies from time to time as our management accounting practices are enhanced and our businesses and management structure change. We typically update key cost allocation components annually. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect current methodologies and our current business and management structure. Financial results are presented, to the extent practicable, as if each business operated on a stand alone basis. We have aggregated the business results for certain similar operating segments for financial reporting purposes. Assets receive a funding charge and liabilities and capital receive a funding credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product maturities, duration and other factors. Capital is intended to cover unexpected losses and is assigned to the banking and servicing businesses using our risk based economic capital model. We have assigned capital equal to 6% of funds to Retail Banking to approximate market comparables for this business. We have allocated the allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit based on our assessment of risk inherent in the business segment loan portfolios. Our allocation of the costs incurred by operations and other shared support areas not directly aligned with the businesses is primarily based on the use of services. Total business segment financial results differ from consolidated results from continuing operations. The impact of these differences is reflected in the Other category. Other for purposes of this Business Segments Review and the Business Segment Highlights in the Executive Summary includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as gains or losses related to BlackRock transactions including LTIP share distributions and obligations, earnings and gains related to Hilliard Lyons for the first quarter of 2008, integration costs, asset and liability management activities including net securities gains or losses and certain trading activities, exited businesses, equity management activities, tax credit investments, alternative investments, intercompany eliminations, most corporate overhead, and differences between business segment performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP), including the presentation of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.

(i) Financial consultants provide services in full service brokerage offices and traditional bank branches. Retail Bankings earnings were $136 million for 2009 compared with $328 million for 2008. Results were challenged in this environment by increased credit costs, lower interest credits assigned to the segments deposits, reduced consumer spending and increased FDIC insurance costs. Pre tax, pre provision earnings were $1.6 billion for 2009, a 65% increase over 2008. Retail Banking continues to maintain its focus on customer, loan and deposit growth, employee and customer satisfaction, investing in the business for future growth, as well as disciplined expense management during this period of market and economic uncertainty. 50 Highlights of Retail Bankings performance for 2009: The acquisition of National City added approximately $29 billion of loans and $81 billion of deposits to Retail Banking. Other salient points related to this acquisition include the following: Added over 1,400 branches, Expanded our ATMs by over 2,100 locations, Established or significantly increased our branch presence in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Missouri and Florida giving PNC one of the largest branch distribution networks among banks in the country, Expanded our customer base with the addition of approximately 2.7 million checking relationships, and Added $12 billion in brokerage account assets. We successfully completed the required divestiture of 61 branches and 73 ATMs from the National City acquisition by early September and the first major conversion of National City customers to the PNC platform in November 2009, with three remaining conversions on schedule to be completed by June 2010. Retail Banking expanded the number of customers it serves and grew checking relationships. Excluding relationships added from acquisitions and the impact of the required divestitures, net new consumer and business checking relationships for legacy PNC grew by 119,000 since December 31, 2008 compared with 70,000 during the same period last year. Our investment in online banking capabilities continued to pay off. Excluding customers added from acquisitions and the impact of the required divestitures, active online bill pay and active online banking customers have increased 18% and 17%, respectively, since December 31, 2008. We continue to seek customer growth by expanding our use of technology, such as our Virtual Wallet online banking product. We leveraged our understanding of this market along with our extensive university banking program and launched a new product in the second quarter of 2009 for college students and their parents, called Virtual Wallet Student. Employee engagement and customer satisfaction/loyalty results are tracking at all time highs. In 2009, we received the Gallup Great Workplace Award in recognition of our extraordinary ability to create an engaged workplace culture. At December 31, 2009, Retail Banking had 2,512 branches and an ATM network of 6,473 machines giving PNC one of the largest distribution networks among US banks. We continued to invest in the branch network, albeit at a slower pace than in prior years given the current economic conditions. We are optimizing our network by opening new branches in high growth areas, relocating branches to areas of higher market opportunity, and consolidating branches in areas of declining opportunity. In 2009, we opened 27 traditional branches and 45 in store branches, added 313 ATMs, and divested 61 branches and 73 ATMs. To continue to optimize our network, we also consolidated 79 and relocated 11 branches in 2009. The in store branches and the ATMs were primarily opened under our previously reported exclusive banking services agreement with Giant Food LLC supermarkets. Total revenue for 2009 was $5.7 billion compared with $2.7 billion in 2008. Net interest income of $3.5 billion increased $1.9 billion compared with 2008. The increase in net interest income was driven by the National City acquisition and was partially offset by declines in legacy net interest income as a result of the negative impact of lower interest credits assigned to the segments deposits in this low rate environment. Noninterest income for 2009 was $2.2 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion over the prior year. The National City acquisition was the major factor for the increase, partially offset by a $95 million gain from the redemption of Visa common shares in the first quarter of 2008. In addition, core growth in brokerage account activities and consumer related fees have been negatively impacted by current economic conditions. The Market Risk Management Equity and Other Investment Risk section of this Item 7 includes further information regarding our investment in Visa. In 2010, Retail Banking revenue will be negatively impacted in a more significant manner by 1) the new rules set forth in Regulation E related to overdraft charges and 2) the Credit CARD Act. Current estimates are that 2010 earnings will be impacted by approximately $115 million related to Regulation E and by approximately $40 million attributable to the Credit CARD Act. These estimates do not include any additional negative impact to revenue for other changes that may be made in 2010 responding to market conditions or other/additional regulatory requirements, or any offsetting impact of changes to products and or pricing. In 2009, the provision for credit losses was $1.3 billion compared with $388 million in 2008. Net charge offs were $1.0 billion for 2009 and $257 million last year. The increases in provision and net charge offs were primarily a result of a loan portfolio that has increased 117%, including a significantly larger credit card portfolio, and the continued credit deterioration in both the commercial and consumer loan portfolios which has required an increase to loan loss reserves. Noninterest expense for 2009 totaled $4.2 billion, an increase of $2.4 billion over last year. The increase was primarily attributable to the impact of acquisitions, as well as increased FDIC insurance costs and continued investments in the business. Growing core checking deposits as a lower cost funding source and as the cornerstone product to build customer 51 relationships is the primary objective of our deposit strategy. Furthermore, core checking accounts are critical to our strategy of expanding our payments business. The deposit strategy of Retail Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing, target specific products and markets for growth, and focus on the retention and growth of balances for relationship customers. Average total deposits increased $80.8 billion compared with 2008. Average money market deposits increased $22.2 billion over 2008. This increase was primarily due to the National City acquisition and core money market growth as customers generally prefer more liquid deposits in a low rate environment. In 2009, average certificates of deposit increased $37.3 billion over the prior year. The increase was due to the National City acquisition, which was partially offset by a decrease in legacy certificates of deposits. The legacy decline is a result of a focus on relationship customers rather than pursuing higher rate single service customers. A continued decline in certificates of deposit is expected in 2010 due to the planned run off of higher rate certificates of deposits that were primarily acquired through acquisition. Average demand deposits increased $17.4 billion over 2008. This increase was driven by acquisitions and organic growth. Currently, we are predominately focused on a relationship based lending strategy that targets specific customer sectors (mass consumers, homeowners, students, small businesses and auto dealerships). In 2009, average total loans were $56.7 billion, an increase of $30.6 billion over 2008. In the current environment, consumer and commercial loan demand is being outpaced by refinances, paydowns, and charge offs. Average commercial and commercial real estate loans grew $7.3 billion compared with 2008. The increase was primarily due to the National City acquisition. Average home equity loans grew $14.1 billion over 2008. The majority of the increase is attributable to the National City acquisition. Our home equity loan portfolio is relationship based, with 96% of the portfolio attributable to borrowers in our primary geographic footprint. The nonperforming assets and charge offs that we have experienced are within our expectations given current market conditions. Average education loans grew $3.6 billion compared with 2008. The increase was due to the National City acquisition and an increase in the core business. The core business increase was primarily a result of the transfer of approximately $1.8 billion of education loans previously held for sale to the loan portfolio during the first quarter of 2008. The education lending business may be adversely impacted by the proposed legislation surrounding guaranteed education loans issued under the current Federal program. Average credit card balances increased $2.0 billion over 2008. The increase was primarily the result of the National City acquisition and also reflected legacy growth of 71% over 2008. Effective January 2010, we will consolidate in our financial statements the securitized portfolio of approximately $1.6 billion of credit card loans.

(g) Recorded investment of purchased impaired loans related to National City, adjusted to reflect additional loan impairments effective December 31, 2008. Corporate & Institutional Banking earned $1.2 billion in 2009 compared with $215 million in 2008. The acquisition of National City positively impacted operating results as revenues nearly tripled while expenses approximately doubled in the comparison. As a result, operating leverage of $2.6 billion more than offset a $1.0 billion increase in the provision for credit losses. Highlights of Corporate & Institutional Banking performance during 2009 include: Net interest income for 2009 was $3.8 billion, an increase of $2.5 billion from 2008 driven primarily by the National City acquisition, higher deposit levels and improved loan spreads. Corporate service fees were $915 million for 2009, an increase of $332 million over 2008. The major components of corporate service fees are treasury management, corporate finance fees and commercial mortgage servicing revenue. We continued to invest in our healthcare initiative which is designed to help provide our customers opportunities to reduce operating costs. Healthcare related revenues in 2009 increased 23% from 2008, to $85 million. The commercial real estate servicing portfolio remained relatively flat except for the impact of the National City acquisition. At Midland Loan Services, growth within the agency servicing portfolio offset the impact of the downturn in the CMBS market during 2008 and 2009. Rising commercial real estate delinquencies and defaults have resulted in growth in the special servicing portfolio, which increased from $2.9 billion at year end 2008, to $12.1 billion at December 31, 2009. Midland Loan Services is the only company in the industry to hold the highest US CMBS primary, master and special servicer ratings from both Fitch and Standard & Poors. In a challenging business environment, our multi family origination activities for FNMA and FHMLC remained robust with 2009 originations of $4.2 billion. Our PNC Loan Syndications business led financings for over 160 middle market clients during 2009. Merger and advisory revenues declined $68 million from 2008 reflecting the impact of the difficult economic environment on acquisition activity. 53 Other noninterest income was $518 million for 2009, an increase of $565 million from 2008 primarily due to the National City acquisition. Operating lease revenues were $106 million in 2009, largely due to the National City acquisition. The combined leasing operations are the 5th largest bank affiliated leasing company. Valuation and sale income related to our commercial mortgage loans held for sale, net of hedges, were $107 million in 2009 compared with losses of $197 million in 2008. Inventory carried at fair value at December 31, 2009 was $1.1 billion, reduced from $1.4 billion at December 31, 2008. Gains on sales of loans related to our portfolio management activities were $95 million in 2009. We sold approximately $1.4 billion of commitments during 2009. Provision for credit losses was $1.6 billion in 2009, an increase of $1.0 billion from 2008, driven by general credit deterioration, primarily in the real estate, middle market and transportation related portfolios, and the National City acquisition. The increases in net charge offs and nonperforming assets were primarily due to the National City acquisition as well as increasing difficulties experienced by middle market customers. Noninterest expense was $1.8 billion for 2009, an increase of $855 million from 2008, due to the National City acquisition. Otherwise, expenses were essentially flat as lower compensation related costs offset higher credit related and FDIC insurance costs. Average loans were $72.1 billion for 2009, an increase of $36.3 billion from 2008, driven by the National City acquisition. We continue to experience declines in utilization rates across our middle market and large corporate customer groups. We continue to pursue new customers that meet our risk profile. We added approximately 500 new corporate clients during 2009. Our PNC Business Credit business increased new lending commitments over 11%, to $15 billion, during 2009. Average deposits were $37.6 billion for 2009, an increase of $20.2 billion over 2008 primarily due to the National City acquisition. PNC continued to experience deposit growth during 2009, including the return of deposits from National City customers who had previously moved funds to other institutions. Harris Williams, our middle market merger and acquisitions advisory firm, recently opened its first overseas office in London under the name Harris Williams Limited. This office provides direct access to European investors.

Including National City, assets under administration totaled $228 billion at December 31, 2008, including discretionary assets under management of $103 billion and nondiscretionary assets under administration of $125 billion. Asset Management Group earned $105 million for 2009 compared with $119 million for 2008. Assets under administration were $205 billion as of December 31, 2009. Asset Management Group achieved strong total revenue of $919 million for 2009, with $308 million in net interest income and $611 million in noninterest income. The business increased pretax, pre provision earnings by $69 million or 35% over 2008, as the business grew clients, managed expenses and successfully executed the National City integration. The earnings decline from 2008 was primarily driven by a $91 million increase in provision for credit losses reflective of a weakened economy. Highlights of Asset Management Groups performance during 2009 include the following: Strong sales and client retention, Increased client satisfaction, and Disciplined expense management. 55 Assets under administration of $205 billion at December 31, 2009 increased $61 billion compared with the balance at December 31, 2008. Including National City, assets under administration were $228 billion at December 31, 2008. Discretionary assets under management of $103 billion at December 31, 2009 increased $46 billion compared with the prior year end balance. The increase in discretionary assets under management is attributable to the National City acquisition. Nondiscretionary assets under administration of $102 billion at December 31, 2009 increased $15 billion compared with the balance at December 31, 2008. This increase was driven by the National City acquisition, somewhat mitigated by a decline in institutional assets related to the exit of a noncore product offering and other National City integration impacts. Total revenue for 2009 was $919 million compared with $559 million for 2008. Net interest income of $308 million reflected additional revenue from the National City loan and deposit portfolios and strong yields from the loan portfolio. The year over year increase in net interest income was partially offset by lower interest credits assigned to the segments deposits in this low interest rate environment. Noninterest income of $611 million increased $182 million compared with 2008 primarily in asset management fees. The growth was attributable to the National City acquisition, client retention and new business development activities. The provision for credit losses of $97 million increased from $6 million in 2008 as loan loss reserves were increased beyond charge offs due to credit quality deterioration. Net charge offs were $63 million for 2009 and $2 million for 2008. Noninterest expense of $654 million increased $291 million in 2009 compared with 2008. The increase is attributable to the National City acquisition. Implementation of various integration related initiatives has mitigated this increase in expenses. Expense management remains a key focal point for this business and the implementation of efficiency initiatives will continue throughout 2010. Balance sheet activity for 2009 reflected both core and acquisition related growth. Average loans of $6.7 billion increased $3.9 billion compared with 2008. Average total deposits of $7.0 billion increased $3.0 billion compared with 2008. During the economic downturn, customers shifted from riskier equity investments into safer deposit products, resulting in solid money market and demand deposit growth. 56 RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BANKING (Unaudited) Year ended December 31 Dollars in millions, except as noted 2009 INCOME STATEMENT Net interest income $ 332 Noninterest income Loan servicing revenue Servicing fees 222 Net MSR hedging gains 355 Loan sales revenue 435 Other (16 ) Total noninterest income 996 Total revenue 1,328 Provision for (recoveries of) credit losses (4 ) Noninterest expense 632 Pretax earnings 700 Income taxes 265 Earnings $ 435 AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET Portfolio loans $ 1,957 Loans held for sale 2,204 Mortgage servicing rights (MSR) 1,297 Other assets 2,962 Total assets $ 8,420 Deposits $ 4,135 Borrowings and other liabilities 2,924 Capital 1,359 Total liabilities and equity $ 8,418 PERFORMANCE RATIOS Return on average capital 32 % Efficiency 48 % OTHER INFORMATION Servicing portfolio for others (in billions) (a) $ 145 Fixed rate 88 % Adjustable rate/balloon 12 % Weighted average interest rate 5.82 % MSR capitalized value (in billions) $ 1.3 MSR capitalization value (in basis points) 91 Weighted average servicing fee (in basis points) 30 Loan origination volume (in billions) $ 19.1 Percentage of originations represented by: Agency and government programs 97 % Refinance volume 72 % Total nonperforming assets (a) (b) $ 370 Impaired loans (a) (c) $ 369 (a) As of December 31.

Residential Mortgage Banking earned $435 million in 2009 driven by strong loan origination activity and net mortgage servicing rights hedging gains. This business segment consists primarily of activities acquired with National City. Residential Mortgage Banking overview: As a step to improve the quality and efficiency of our mortgage operations, during 2009 we consolidated approximately 90 existing operations sites into two locations Chicago and Pittsburgh. Total loan originations were $19.1 billion for 2009, reflecting strong loan refinance activity consistent with industry trends. However, rising mortgage rates during the second half of 2009 reduced incoming application volume. Loans were primarily originated through direct channels under agency (FNMA, FHLMC, FHA/VA) guidelines. Investors may request PNC to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans that they believe do not comply with applicable representations. During 2009, the frequency of such requests increased in relation to prior years. Management maintains a liability for estimated losses on loans expected to be repurchased or on which indemnification is expected to be provided. At December 31, 2009 this liability for Residential Mortgage Banking was $229 million. See Note 25 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled $145 billion at December 31, 2009 compared with $173 billion at January 1, 2009, as payoffs exceeded new direct loan origination volume during the year. In addition, $7.9 billion of servicing was sold in the fourth quarter. Noninterest income was $996 million for 2009, driven by loan sales revenue of $435 million that resulted from strong loan origination refinance volume and net mortgage servicing rights hedging gains of $355 million. In 2010, we do not expect a significant level of servicing hedge gains. Additionally, we do not expect refinance and application volumes to be as strong in 2010 as they were for 2009. Net interest income was $332 million for 2009 resulting from residential mortgage loans held for sale associated with strong loan origination refinance volumes during the year. Noninterest expense was $632 million for 2009 and included incremental staffing costs associated with strong origination volumes and an increased focus on loan underwriting and loss mitigation activities. The carrying value of mortgage servicing rights was $1.3 billion at December 31, 2009 compared with $1.0 billion at January 1, 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to a higher fair value of the asset resulting from lower prepayment expectations due to rising interest rates during the period. 57 BLACKROCK Information related to our equity investment in BlackRock follows: 2009 2008 Business segment earnings(in millions) (a) $ 207 $ 207 PNCs share of BlackRock earnings (b) 23 % 33 % Carrying value of PNCs investment in BlackRock (in billions) (b) $ 5.8 $ 4.2 (a) Includes PNCs share of BlackRocks reported GAAP earnings and additional income taxes on those earnings incurred by PNC.

BLACKROCK/BARCLAYS GLOBAL INVESTORS TRANSACTION On December 1, 2009, BlackRock acquired BGI from Barclays Bank PLC in exchange for approximately $6.65 billion in cash and 37,566,771 shares of BlackRock common and participating preferred stock. In connection with the BGI transaction, BlackRock entered into amendments to stockholder agreements with PNC and its other major shareholder. These amendments, which changed certain shareholder rights, including composition of the BlackRock Board of Directors and share transfer restrictions, became effective upon closing of the BGI transaction. Also in connection with the BGI transaction, BlackRock entered into a stock purchase agreement with PNC in which we purchased 3,556,188 shares of BlackRocks Series D Preferred Stock at a price of $140.60 per share, or $500 million, to partially finance the transaction. On January 31, 2010, the Series D Preferred Stock was converted to Series B Preferred Stock. Upon closing of the BGI transaction, the carrying value of our investment in BlackRock increased significantly, reflecting our portion of the increase in BlackRocks equity resulting from the value of BlackRock shares issued in connection with their acquisition of BGI. PNC recognized this increase in value as a $1.076 billion pretax gain in the fourth quarter of 2009. At December 31, 2009, our percentage ownership of BlackRock common stock was approximately 35%. BLACKROCK LTIP PROGRAMS AND EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS PNCs noninterest income included pretax gains of $98 million in 2009 and $243 million in 2008 related to our BlackRock LTIP shares obligation. These gains represented the mark to market adjustment related to our remaining BlackRock LTIP common shares obligation and resulted from the decrease in the market value of BlackRock common shares in those periods. As previously reported, PNC entered into an Exchange Agreement with BlackRock on December 26, 2008. The transactions that resulted from this agreement restructured PNCs ownership of BlackRock equity without altering, to any meaningful extent, PNCs economic interest in BlackRock. PNC continues to be subject to the limitations on its voting rights in its existing agreements with BlackRock. Also on December 26, 2008, BlackRock entered into an Exchange Agreement with Merrill Lynch in anticipation of the consummation of the merger of Bank of America Corporation and Merrill Lynch that occurred on January 1, 2009. The PNC and Merrill Lynch Exchange Agreements restructured PNCs and Merrill Lynchs respective ownership of BlackRock common and preferred equity. The exchange contemplated by these agreements was completed on February 27, 2009. On that date, PNCs obligation to deliver BlackRock common shares was replaced with an obligation to deliver shares of BlackRocks new Series C Preferred Stock. PNC acquired 2.9 million shares of Series C Preferred Stock from BlackRock in exchange for common shares on that same date. PNC accounts for these preferred shares at fair value, which offsets the impact of marking to market the obligation to deliver these shares to BlackRock as we aligned the fair value marks on this asset and liability. The fair value of the BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock is included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet in Other assets. Additional information regarding the valuation of the BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock is included in Note 8 Fair Value in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. PNC accounts for its remaining investment in BlackRock under the equity method of accounting, with its share of BlackRocks earnings reduced primarily due to the exchange of BlackRock common stock for BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock. The Series C Preferred Stock is not taken into consideration in determining PNCs share of BlackRock earnings under the equity method. PNCs percentage ownership of BlackRock common stock increased as a result of the substantial exchange of Merrill Lynchs BlackRock common stock for BlackRock preferred stock. As a result of the BlackRock preferred stock held by Merrill Lynch and the new BlackRock preferred stock issued to Merrill Lynch and PNC under the Exchange Agreements, PNCs share of BlackRock common stock is higher than its overall share of BlackRocks equity and earnings. The transactions related to the Exchange Agreements do not affect our right to receive dividends declared by BlackRock. 58 DISTRESSED ASSETS PORTFOLIO (Unaudited) Year ended December 31 Dollars in millions, except as noted 2009 INCOME STATEMENT Net interest income $ 1,079 Noninterest income 74 Total revenue 1,153 Provision for credit losses 771 Noninterest expense 246 Pretax earnings 136 Income taxes 52 Earnings $ 84 AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET COMMERCIAL LENDING: Commercial $ 155 Commercial real estate Real estate projects 2,780 Commercial mortgage 97 Equipment lease financing 818 Total commercial lending 3,850 CONSUMER LENDING: Consumer: Home equity lines of credit 4,952 Home equity installment loans 2,134 Other consumer 15 Total consumer 7,101 Residential real estate: Residential mortgage 8,729 Residential construction 1,436 Total residential real estate 10,165 Total consumer lending 17,266 Total portfolio loans 21,116 Other assets 1,728 Total assets $ 22,844 Deposits $ 39 Other liabilities 92 Capital 1,574 Total liabilities and equity $ 1,705 OTHER INFORMATION Nonperforming assets (a) (b) $ 1,787 Impaired loans (a) (c) $ 7,577 Net charge offs (d) $ 544 Net charge offs as a percentage of portfolio loans (d) 2.58 % LOANS (IN BILLIONS) (a) Commercial Residential development $ 2.6 Cross border leases .8 Consumer Brokered home equity 6.4 Retail mortgages 5.2 Non prime mortgages 1.7 Residential completed construction 1.3 Residential construction .5 Total loans $ 18.5 (a) As of December 31. (b) Includes nonperforming loans of $1.456 billion. (c) Recorded investment of purchased impaired loans related to National City, adjusted to reflect additional loan impairments effective December 31, 2008. (d) For the year ended December 31. This business segment consists primarily of assets acquired with National City. The Distressed Assets Portfolio had earnings of $84 million for 2009. Earnings were largely driven by net interest income of $1.1 billion. The provision for credit losses was $771 million in 2009, which reflected credit quality deterioration, particularly in the commercial residential development and consumer residential construction portfolios. Noninterest expense was $246 million for 2009, comprised primarily of costs associated with foreclosed assets and servicing costs. Distressed Assets Portfolio overview: Total loans were $18.5 billion at December 31, 2009 compared with $27 billion at January 1, 2009. The reduction in loans during 2009 was primarily due to net paydowns and charge offs. The loan portfolio included commercial residential development loans, cross border leases, consumer brokered home equity loans, retail mortgages, non prime mortgages and residential construction loans. Certain loans in this business segment may require special servicing given current loan performance and market conditions. Consequently, the business activities of this segment are focused on maximizing the value of the portfolios assigned to it while mitigating risk. Business intent drives the inclusion of assets in this business segment. Not all impaired loans are included in this business segment, nor are all of the loans included in this business segment considered impaired. The $18.5 billion of loans held in this portfolio are stated inclusive of a fair value mark at acquisition. Taking the mark and loan loss allowance into account, the net carrying basis of this loan portfolio is 75% of customer outstandings. The commercial residential development portfolio has undergone a loan review of the project collateral, including certain site visits. A team of asset managers has been assembled to address workout strategies. Actions taken on the portfolio included reducing unfunded loan exposure, foreclosing on residential real estate development properties, and selling loans. Brokered home equity loans include closed end second liens and open end home equity lines of credit. Our focus for managing these portfolios is to maximize the value of the portfolio. We have implemented several modification programs to assist the loss mitigation teams that manage this risk. Additionally, we have initiated several voluntary and involuntary programs to reduce and or block line availability on home equity lines of credit. Retail mortgages are primarily jumbo and ALT A first lien mortgages originated for sale in the second half of 2007 for which firm commitments to lend had been extended but there was no market to sell the production. As part of our loss mitigation strategy, 59 we have transferred a small portfolio to a third party servicer. Additionally, given the low level of mortgage rates relative to where these loans were originated, we have implemented several internal and external refinance programs to proactively work with the borrowers to explore refinance alternatives that would allow them to qualify for a conforming mortgage loan which would be originated and sold by the company or the third party originator. Active construction loans remain available as a part of some construction phases of the real estate development and have not been fully funded. Properties are reviewed by a dedicated team to assess the appropriate strategy for optimizing the return on these assets while mitigating risk. To the extent we believe that completion of the construction on a particular project will maximize value, additional advances under the construction facility may be considered. The goal for these projects would be to move such project toward completion. Otherwise, the property is to be managed on an as is basis or returned to raw land for sale. Completed construction loans are comprised of loans on which all phases of property construction are complete and the loan has been funded as needed to allow for construction completion. We are managing completed construction loans consistent with the strategies for residential real estate loans. The fair value marks taken upon our acquisition of National City, along with the team assembled to provide specific focus on this business segment, put us in a good position to manage these assets. Additionally, our capital and liquidity position provide us flexibility to be prudent in terms of continuing to hold these assets or selling them to another investor to obtain the optimum return. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS Our consolidated financial statements are prepared by applying certain accounting policies. Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report describes the most significant accounting policies that we use. Certain of these policies require us to make estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or be subject to variations that may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods. Fair Value Measurements We must use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. This includes the initial measurement at fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions qualifying as business combinations under GAAP, Business Combinations (Topic 805). The valuation of both financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities in these transactions requires numerous assumptions and estimates and the use of third party sources including appraisers and valuation specialists. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including those elected under Financial Instruments (Topic 825), include available for sale and trading securities, financial derivatives, certain commercial and residential mortgage loans held for sale, customer resale agreements, private equity investments, and residential mortgage servicing rights. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on either quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third party sources, when available. When such third party information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations. Effective January 1, 2008, PNC adopted Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820). This guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This guidance established a three level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used in the measurement are observable or unobservable. The following sections of this Report provide further information on this type of activity: Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value Option included within this Item 7, and Note 8 Fair Value included in Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Allowances For Loan And Lease Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters Of Credit We maintain allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at levels that we believe to be adequate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio. We determine the adequacy of the allowances based on periodic evaluations of the loan and lease portfolios and other relevant factors. However, this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates, all of which may be susceptible to significant change, including, among others: Probability of default, Loss given default, Exposure at date of default, 60 Amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, Value of collateral, Historical loss exposure, and Amounts for changes in economic conditions that may not be reflected in historical results. In determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses, we make specific allocations to impaired loans, allocations to pools of watchlist and non watchlist loans, and allocations to consumer and residential mortgage loans. We also allocate reserves to provide coverage for probable losses not covered in specific, pool and consumer reserve methodologies related to qualitative factors. While allocations are made to specific loans and pools of loans, the total reserve is available for all credit losses. Commercial lending is the largest category of credits and is the most sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses. We have allocated approximately $3.4 billion, or 66%, of the allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2009 to the commercial lending category. Consumer and residential mortgage loan allocations are made at a total portfolio level based on historical loss experience adjusted for portfolio activity. Approximately $1.7 billion, or 34%, of the allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2009 have been allocated to these consumer lending categories. To the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates, additional provision for credit losses may be required that would reduce future earnings. See the following for additional information: Allowances For Loan And Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters Of Credit in the Credit Risk Management section of this Item 7 (which includes an illustration of the estimated impact on the aggregate of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit assuming we increased pool reserve loss rates for certain loan categories), and Note 5 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements and Allocation Of Allowance For Loan And Lease Losses in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section of Item 8 of this Report. Estimated Cash Flows on Purchased Impaired Loans FASB ASC Receivables (Topic 310) Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality formerly SOP 03 3, provides the GAAP guidance for accounting for certain loans that have experienced a deterioration of credit quality from origination to acquisition for which it is probable that the investor will be unable to collect all contractually required payments receivable, including both principal and interest. In our assessment of credit quality deterioration, we must make numerous assumptions, interpretations and judgments, using internal and third party credit quality information to determine whether it is probable that we will be able to collect all contractually required payments. This is a point in time assessment and inherently subjective due to the nature of the available information and judgment involved. Those loans that qualify under Topic 310 are recorded at fair value at acquisition, which involves estimating the expected cash flows to be received. Measurement of the fair value of the loan is based on the provisions of Topic 820. Also, GAAP prohibits the carryover or establishment of an allowance for loan losses on the acquisition date. Subsequent to the acquisition of the loan, GAAP requires that we continue to estimate cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the loan. The measurement of expected cash flows involves assumptions and judgments as to credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, default rates, loss severity, payment speeds and collateral values. All of these factors are inherently subjective and can result in significant changes in the cash flow estimates over the life of the loan. Such changes in expected cash flows could increase future earnings volatility due to increases or decreases in the accretable yield (i.e., the difference between the undiscounted expected cash flows and the recorded investment in the loan). The accretable yield is recognized as interest income on a constant effective yield method over the life of the loan. In addition, changes in expected cash flows could result in the recognition of impairment through provision for credit losses if the decline in expected cash flows is attributable to a decline in credit quality. Goodwill Goodwill arising from business acquisitions represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired. Most of our goodwill relates to value inherent in the Retail Banking, Corporate & Institutional Banking and Global Investment Servicing businesses. The value of this goodwill is dependent upon our ability to provide quality, cost effective services in the face of competition from other market participants on a national and international basis. We also rely upon continuing investments in processing systems, the development of value added service features, and the ease of access by customers to our services. As such, the value of goodwill is ultimately supported by earnings, which is driven by transaction volume and, for certain businesses, the market value of assets under administration or for which processing services are provided. Lower earnings resulting from a lack of growth or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill, which could result in a current period charge to earnings. At least annually, management reviews the current operating environment and strategic direction of each reporting unit taking into consideration any events or changes in circumstances that may 61 have an effect on the unit. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. This input is then used to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, which is compared to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then the goodwill of that reporting unit is not considered impaired. During the fourth quarter 2008, and the first quarter of 2009, PNC considered whether the decline in the fair value of our market capitalization due to market conditions is an indicator of declines in the fair value of the reporting units. Although the fair values of the reporting units decreased, their estimated fair values are still considered to be in excess of their respective carrying values. Of the $9.5 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009, approximately $43 million was associated with the Residential Mortgage Banking reporting unit acquired as part of the National City acquisition. As of October 1, 2009, the date of PNCs annual goodwill impairment testing, the fair value of the Residential Mortgage Banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 11%. Since 11% is a narrow percentage, this reporting unit may be considered the most likely to become impaired in the future. The fair value of this reporting unit had been determined using a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation model. We used the discounted cash flow median of the comparables, which we believe approximates the fair market value of the unit. The statistical information underlying the comparables and the resulting DCF valuation are highly sensitive to market changes. Therefore, any future deterioration in the residential mortgage market environment may have an adverse impact on the valuation which could result in a reduction of the excess over carrying value and possible impairment of the goodwill. Based on the results of our analysis, there have been no impairment charges related to goodwill. See Note 9 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Lease Residuals We provide financing for various types of equipment, aircraft, energy and power systems, and rolling stock through a variety of lease arrangements. Direct financing leases are carried at the sum of lease payments and the estimated residual value of the leased property, less unearned income. Residual value insurance or guarantees by governmental entities provide support for a significant portion of the residual value. Residual values are subject to judgments as to the value of the underlying equipment that can be affected by changes in economic and market conditions and the financial viability of the residual guarantors and insurers. To the extent not guaranteed or assumed by a third party, or otherwise insured against, we bear the risk of ownership of the leased assets. This includes the risk that the actual value of the leased assets at the end of the lease term will be less than the residual value, which could result in an impairment charge and reduce earnings in the future. Residual values are reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis. Revenue Recognition We derive net interest and noninterest income from various sources, including: Lending, Securities portfolio, Asset management and fund servicing, Customer deposits, Loan servicing, Brokerage services, Merger and acquisition advisory services, Sale of loans and securities, Certain private equity activities, and Securities and derivatives trading activities including foreign exchange. We also earn fees and commissions from issuing loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, selling various insurance products, providing treasury management services and participating in certain capital markets transactions. Revenue earned on interest earning assets including the accretion of fair value adjustments on discounts for purchased loans is recognized based on the effective yield of the financial instrument. The timing and amount of revenue that we recognize in any period is dependent on estimates, judgments, assumptions, and interpretation of contractual terms. Changes in these factors can have a significant impact on revenue recognized in any period due to changes in products, market conditions or industry norms. Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights In conjunction with the acquisition of National City, PNC acquired servicing rights for residential real estate loans. We have elected to measure these mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) at fair value. MSRs are established and valued using discounted cash flow modeling techniques which require management to make estimates regarding future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs, and numerous other factors. PNC employs a risk management strategy designed to protect the value of MSRs from changes in interest rates. MSR values are economically hedged with securities and a portfolio of derivatives, including interest rate swaps, options, forward mortgage backed, and futures contracts. As interest rates change, these financial instruments are expected to have changes in fair value which are negatively correlated to the change in fair value of the hedged MSR portfolio. The hedge relationships are actively managed in response to changing market conditions over the life of the MSR assets. Selecting appropriate financial instruments to hedge this risk requires significant management judgment to assess how mortgage 62 rates and prepayment speeds could affect the future values of MSRs. Hedging results can frequently be volatile in the short term, but over longer periods of time are expected to protect the economic value of the MSR portfolio. The fair value of residential MSRs and significant inputs to the valuation model as of December 31, 2009 are shown in the table below. The expected and actual rates of mortgage loan prepayments are the most significant factors driving the fair value. Management uses an internal proprietary model to estimate future loan prepayments. This model uses empirical data drawn from the historical performance of our managed portfolio, as adjusted for current market conditions. Future interest rates are another important factor in the valuation of MSRs. Management utilizes market implied forward interest rates to estimate the future direction of mortgage and discount rates. The forward rates utilized are derived from the current yield curve for US dollar interest rate swaps and are consistent with pricing of capital markets instruments. Changes in the shape and slope of the forward curve in future periods may result in volatility in the fair value estimate. Dollars in millions December 31 2009 Fair value $ 1,332 Weighted average life (in years) 4.5 Weighted average constant prepayment rate 19.92 % Spread over forward interest rate swap rates 12.16 % A sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical effect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse changes in key assumptions is presented below. Changes in fair value generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the MSRs is calculated independently without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example, changes in mortgage interest rates, which drive changes in prepayment rate estimates, could result in changes in the interest rate spread), which could either magnify or counteract the sensitivities. Dollars in millions December 312009 Prepayment rate: Decline in fair value from 10% adverse change $ 56 Decline in fair value from 20% adverse change $ 109 Spread over forward interest rate swap rates: Decline in fair value from 10% adverse change $ 55 Decline in fair value from 20% adverse change $ 106 Income Taxes In the normal course of business, we and our subsidiaries enter into transactions for which the tax treatment is unclear or subject to varying interpretations. In addition, filing requirements, methods of filing and the calculation of taxable income in various state and local jurisdictions are subject to differing interpretations. We evaluate and assess the relative risks and merits of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions, filing positions, filing methods and taxable income calculations after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent, and other information, and maintain tax accruals consistent with our evaluation of these relative risks and merits. The result of our evaluation and assessment is by its nature an estimate. We and our subsidiaries are routinely subject to audit and challenges from taxing authorities. In the event we resolve a challenge for an amount different than amounts previously accrued, we will account for the difference in the period in which we resolve the matter. Additional information regarding our Critical Accounting Policies and Judgments is found elsewhere in this Item 7 and in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for information on new accounting pronouncements that were effective in 2008, 2009 or became effective on January 1, 2010. In addition, the following Accounting Standards Update (ASU) was issued in early 2010: In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010 6, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820), Improving Disclosures About Fair Value Measurements. This guidance provides amendments to require new disclosures as follows: transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2 and the reasons for the transfers, and additional breakout of asset and liability categories. This guidance will be effective for PNC for the first quarter 2010 reporting. This guidance also requires purchases, sales, issuances and settlements to be reported separately in the Level 3 rollforward. This additional guidance will be effective for PNC beginning with the first quarter 2011 reporting. STATUS OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN We have a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan (plan or pension plan) covering eligible employees. Benefits are derived from cash balance formulas based on compensation levels, age and length of service. Pension contributions are based on an actuarially determined amount necessary to fund total benefits payable to plan participants. Consistent with our investment strategy, plan assets are primarily invested in equity investments and fixed income instruments. Plan fiduciaries determine and review the plans 63 investment policy, which is described more fully in Note 15 Employee Benefit Plans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. We calculate the expense associated with the pension plan and the assumptions and methods that we use include a policy of reflecting trust assets at their fair market value. On an annual basis, we review the actuarial assumptions related to the pension plan, including the discount rate, the rate of compensation increase and the expected return on plan assets. The discount rate and compensation increase assumptions do not significantly affect pension expense. However, the expected long term return on assets assumption does significantly affect pension expense. Our expected long term return on plan assets for determining net periodic pension expense has been 8.25% for the past three years. The expected return on plan assets is a long term assumption established by considering historical and anticipated returns of the asset classes invested in by the pension plan and the allocation strategy currently in place among those classes. While this analysis gives appropriate consideration to recent asset performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long term prospective return. We review this assumption at each measurement date and adjust it if warranted. For purposes of setting and reviewing this assumption, long term refers to the period over which the plans projected benefit obligation will be disbursed. While year to year annual returns can vary significantly (rates of return for the reporting years of 2009, 2008, and 2007 were +20.61%, 32.91%, and +7.57%, respectively), the assumption represents our estimate of long term average prospective returns. Our selection process references certain historical data and the current environment, but primarily utilizes qualitative judgment regarding future return expectations. Recent annual returns may differ but, recognizing the volatility and unpredictability of investment returns, we generally do not change the assumption unless we modify our investment strategy or identify events that would alter our expectations of future returns. To evaluate the continued reasonableness of our assumption, we examine a variety of viewpoints and data. Various studies have shown that portfolios comprised primarily of US equity securities have returned approximately 10% over long periods of time, while US debt securities have returned approximately 6% annually over long periods. Application of these historical returns to the plans allocation of equities and bonds produces a result between 8% and 8.5% and is one point of reference, among many other factors, that is taken into consideration. We also examine the plans actual historical returns over various periods. Recent experience is considered in our evaluation with appropriate consideration that, especially for short time periods, recent returns are not reliable indicators of future returns, and in many cases low returns in recent time periods are followed by higher returns in future periods (and vice versa). Acknowledging the potentially wide range for this assumption, we also annually examine the assumption used by other companies with similar pension investment strategies, so that we can ascertain whether our determinations markedly differ from other observers. In all cases, however, this data simply informs our process, which places the greatest emphasis on our qualitative judgment of future investment returns, given the conditions existing at each annual measurement date. The expected long term return on plan assets for determining net periodic pension cost for 2009 was 8.25%, unchanged from 2008. During 2010, we intend to decrease the midpoint of the plans target allocation range for equities by approximately five percentage points. As a result of this change and taking into account all other factors described above, PNC will change the expected long term return on plan assets to 8.00% for determining net periodic pension cost for 2010. Under current accounting rules, the difference between expected long term returns and actual returns is accumulated and amortized to pension expense over future periods. Each one percentage point difference in actual return compared with our expected return causes expense in subsequent years to change by up to $8 million as the impact is amortized into results of operations. The table below reflects the estimated effects on pension expense of certain changes in annual assumptions, using 2010 estimated expense as a baseline. Change in Assumption(a) EstimatedIncrease to 2010PensionExpense (In millions) .5% decrease in discount rate $ 10 .5% decrease in expected long term return on assets $ 18 .5% increase in compensation rate $ 3 (a) The impact is the effect of changing the specified assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. We currently estimate a pretax pension expense of $41 million in 2010 compared with pretax expense of $117 million in 2009. This year over year reduction was primarily due to the amortization impact of the favorable 2009 investment returns as compared with the expected long term return assumption. Our pension plan contribution requirements are not particularly sensitive to actuarial assumptions. Investment performance has the most impact on contribution requirements and will drive the amount of permitted contributions in future years. Also, current law, including the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, sets limits as to both minimum and maximum contributions to the plan. We expect that the minimum required contributions under the law will be zero for 2010. We maintain other defined benefit plans that have a less significant effect on financial results, including various 64 nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees. See Note 15 Employee Benefit Plans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. RISK MANAGEMENT We encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks. This Risk Management section describes our risk management philosophy, principles, governance and various aspects of our corporate level risk management program. We also provide an overview of 2009 enterprise wide risk, followed by an analysis of our primary areas of risk: credit, operational, liquidity, and market. The discussion of market risk is further subdivided into interest rate, trading, and equity and other investment risk areas. Our use of financial derivatives as part of our overall asset and liability risk management process is also addressed within the Risk Management section of this Item 7. In appropriate places within this section, historical performance is also addressed. Risk Management Philosophy PNCs risk management philosophy is to manage to an overall moderate level of risk to capture opportunities and optimize shareholder value. We dynamically set our strategies and make distinct risk taking decisions with consideration for the impact to our aggregate risk profile. While, due to the National City acquisition and the overall state of the economy, our enterprise risk profile does not currently meet our desired moderate risk level, we are making progress in returning to that level. Risk Management Principles Designed to only take risks consistent with our strategy and within our capability to manage, Limit risk taking by a set of boundaries, Practice disciplined capital and liquidity management, Help ensure that risks and earnings volatility are appropriately understood, measured and rewarded, Avoid excessive concentrations, and Help support external stakeholder confidence in PNC. We support risk management through a governance structure involving the Board, senior management and a corporate risk management organization. Although our Board as a whole is responsible generally for oversight of risk management, committees of the Board provide oversight to specific areas of risk with respect to the level of risk and risk management structure. We use management level risk committees to help ensure that business decisions are executed within our desired risk profile. The Executive Committee (EC), consisting of senior management executives, provides oversight for the establishment and implementation of new comprehensive risk management initiatives, reviews enterprise level risk profiles and discusses key risk issues. Corporate Level Risk Management Program The corporate risk management organization has the following key roles: Facilitate the identification, assessment and monitoring of risk across PNC, Provide support and oversight to the businesses, Help identify and implement risk management best practices, as appropriate, and Work with the lines of business to shape and define PNCs business risk limits. Risk Measurement We conduct risk measurement activities specific to each area of risk. The primary vehicle for aggregation of enterprise wide risk is a comprehensive risk management methodology that is based on economic capital. This primary risk aggregation measure is supplemented with secondary measures of risk to arrive at an estimate of enterprise wide risk. The economic capital framework is a measure of potential losses above and beyond expected losses. Potential one year losses are capitalized to a level commensurate with a financial institution with an A rating by the credit rating agencies. Economic capital incorporates risk associated with potential credit losses (Credit Risk), fluctuations of the estimated market value of financial instruments (Market Risk), failure of people, processes or systems (Operational Risk), and losses associated with declining volumes, margins and or fees, and the fixed cost structure of the business. We estimate credit and market risks at pool and exposure levels while we estimate the remaining risk types at an institution or business segment level. We routinely compare the output of our economic capital model with industry benchmarks. Risk Control Strategies Risk management is not about eliminating risks, but about identifying and accepting risks and then working to effectively manage them so as to optimize shareholder value. We centrally manage policy development and exception approval and oversight through corporate level risk management. Some of these policies express our risk appetite through limits to the acceptable level of risk. We are in excess of certain limits and are progressively managing to bring our risks within policy. We are also reviewing and revising certain policies to better reflect our larger and more complex organization. Corporate risk management is authorized to take action to either prevent or mitigate unapproved exceptions to policies and is responsible for monitoring compliance with risk management policies. The Corporate Audit function performs an independent assessment of the internal control environment. Corporate Audit plays a critical role in risk 65 management, testing the operation of the internal control system and reporting findings to management and to the Audit Committee of the Board. Risk Monitoring Corporate Risk Management reports on a regular basis to our Board regarding the enterprise risk profile of the Corporation. These reports aggregate and present the level of risk by type of risk and communicate significant risk issues, including performance relative to risk tolerance limits. Both the Board and the EC provide guidance on actions to address key risk issues as identified in these reports. 2009 Overview of Enterprise Wide Risk Our enterprise risk profile reflects continued deterioration in credit quality, albeit at a slower pace. Contributing factors include the adverse economy and higher credit risk portfolios acquired from other institutions, primarily National City. Significant effort was expended during 2009 to embed PNCs risk management governance, processes, and culture. The combined enterprise is under PNCs risk management philosophy, principles, governance and corporate level risk management program. We also made investments and strengthened risk management governance and practices in areas where we did not have a significant presence prior to the National City acquisition, such as credit card, residential first mortgage lending, and residential mortgage servicing. Credit risk management actions undertaken across the combined enterprise include further refinement of underwriting standards, continued reductions in credit exposure where appropriate and increased frequency of credit risk monitoring and management activities. However, we continue to originate and renew loans and lines of credit within the boundaries of our risk management framework. To further mitigate credit risk and reduce the pace of deterioration, we continue to exit certain lending areas and liquidate certain loan portfolios. Where we have chosen not to retain the risk, it is either because it did not fit within our desired moderate risk profile, or because we are not being adequately compensated for such risk. Our exit and liquidation strategy is to effectively mitigate risk while optimizing shareholder return. We also designated certain purchased loans as impaired, and reduced their carrying value to the net present value of the amounts we believe we can collect. As of December 31, 2009, we had $15.2 billion unpaid principal balance of purchased impaired loans, carried on our balance sheet at $10.3 billion. Although approximately 11% of our $56 billion securities portfolio is sub investment grade, we believe the risk of loss is manageable given credit impairment charges taken to date, continued monitoring and management, and stress testing. Our earnings enabled us to further bolster reserves to cover anticipated credit losses, as well as strengthen capital to further insulate us from unanticipated losses. New common equity issued in 2009 and subsequently in 2010, provides cushion against the risk that economic conditions worsen over the next several years. Relative to the prior two years, there was less volatility in the capital markets, stabilization of security prices, and the return of market liquidity during 2009. Nonetheless we maintained a heightened sense of alert by reducing market risk and are in compliance with all of our market risk limits. Operational risk at the enterprise level is primarily driven by the continued integration of National City and the risks associated with the significant increase in our size and complexity resulting from this acquisition. Integration objectives have been met to date, due to effective management and integration governance. We will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of key processes, technologies and controls to help assure performance at expected levels post integration. Given our increased size and complexity, modifications to our enterprise wide risk management governance and practices are in process. We also view Basel II as an opportunity to enhance our risk management practices, and we have dedicated a significant amount of resources for the next several years to this initiative. Industry events have resulted in heightened risk management governance and practices in areas such as incentive compensation plans. Additionally, the pace and breadth of recent and anticipated regulatory changes has increased our emphasis on regulatory compliance, particularly with respect to consumer products and services such as mortgage, consumer lending, investments, and credit card. Our liquidity, which we increased with recent equity and debt issuances and expect will be further bolstered by the planned sale of GIS in the third quarter of 2010, allowed us to redeem our Series N Preferred Stock within 14 months and provides a cushion should volatility and illiquidity return to the capital markets. CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT Credit risk represents the possibility that a customer, counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. Credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into financial derivative transactions and certain guarantee contracts. Credit risk is one of our most significant risks. Approved risk tolerances, in addition to credit policies and procedures, set portfolio objectives for the level of credit risk. We have established guidelines for problem loans, acceptable levels of total borrower exposure, and other credit measures. 66 We seek to achieve our credit portfolio objectives by maintaining a customer base that is diverse in borrower exposure and industry types. We use loan participations with third parties, loan sales and syndications, and the purchase of credit derivatives to reduce risk concentrations. Corporate Credit personnel also participate in loan underwriting and approval processes to help ensure that newly approved loans meet policy and portfolio objectives. The credit granting businesses maintain direct responsibility for monitoring credit risk within PNC. The Corporate Credit Policy area provides independent oversight to the measurement, monitoring and reporting of our credit risk and reports to the Chief Risk Officer. Corporate Audit also provides an independent assessment of the effectiveness of the credit risk management process. We also manage credit risk in accordance with regulatory guidance. Nonperforming, Past Due And Potential Problem Assets See the Nonperforming Assets And Related Information table in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section of Item 8 of this Report and included here by reference for details of the types of nonperforming assets that we held at December 31 of each of the past five years. In addition, certain performing assets have interest payments that are past due or have the potential for future repayment problems. Credit quality deterioration continued during 2009 as expected, reflecting further economic weakening and resulting in net additions to loan loss reserves. However, past due loans appear to be stabilizing and while nonperforming loans increased in the fourth quarter of 2009, the growth rate was lower than in prior 2009 quarters. Nonperforming assets increased $4.1 billion to $6.3 billion at December 31, 2009 compared with $2.2 billion at December 31, 2008. The increase resulted from recessionary conditions in the economy and reflected a $2.6 billion increase in commercial lending nonperforming loans and a $1.4 billion increase in consumer lending nonperforming loans. The increase in nonperforming commercial lending was primarily from real estate, including residential real estate development and commercial real estate exposure; manufacturing; and service providers. The increase in nonperforming consumer lending was mainly due to residential mortgage loans. While nonperforming assets increased across all applicable business segments during 2009, the largest increases were $2.0 billion in Corporate & Institutional Banking and $854 million in Distressed Assets Portfolio. Purchased impaired loans are excluded from nonperforming loans. Any decrease in expected cash flows of individual commercial or pooled consumer purchased impaired loans would result in a charge to the provision for loan losses in the period in which the change becomes probable. Any increase in the expected cash flows of purchased impaired loans would first result in a recovery of previously recorded allowance for loan losses and then an increase to accretable interest income for the remaining life of the impaired loans. See Note 6 Purchased Impaired Loans Related to National City in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information. The portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses allocated to commercial lending nonperforming loans was 29% at December 31, 2009 and 34% at December 31, 2008. Approximately 60% of these nonperforming loans are secured by collateral that is expected to reduce credit losses and require less reserves in the event of default. Additionally, the allowance for loan and lease losses was reduced by $112 million during 2009 relating to additional loans deemed to be within the scope of FASB ASC 310 30 as of December 31, 2008. Nonperforming assets were 3.99% of total loans and foreclosed and other assets at December 31, 2009 compared with 1.24% at December 31, 2008.

(b) Amounts at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 included $3.8 billion and $738 million, respectively, of nonperforming assets related to National City, excluding those loans that we impaired. 67 Change In Nonperforming Assets In millions 2009 2008 January 1 $ 2,181 $ 495 Transferred from accrual 8,501 1,981 Charge offs and valuation adjustments (1,770 ) (491 ) Principal activity including payoffs (1,127 ) (381 ) Asset sales (798 ) (43 ) Returned to performing (671 ) (127 ) National City acquisition 738 Sterling acquisition 9 December 31 $ 6,316 $ 2,181 Total nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets in the tables above are significantly lower than they would have been otherwise due to the accounting treatment for purchased impaired loans. This treatment also results in lower ratios of nonperforming loans to total loans and allowance for loan and lease losses to nonperforming loans. We recorded such loans at estimated fair value of $12.7 billion at December 31, 2008, including an impairment mark for life of loan credit losses. These loans are considered performing, even if contractually past due (or if we do not expect to receive payment in full based on the original contractual terms), as we are currently accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans. The accretable interest/yield represents the excess of expected cash flows on the loans at the measurement date over the recorded investment. See Note 6 Purchased Impaired Loans Related to National City in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on those loans. At December 31, 2009, our largest nonperforming asset was approximately $49 million and our average nonperforming loan associated with commercial lending was approximately $1 million. The amount of nonperforming loans that were current as to principal and interest was $1.7 billion at December 31, 2009 and $555 million at December 31, 2008. Loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner which grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties where we do not receive adequate compensation are considered troubled debt restructurings. Troubled debt restructurings typically result from our loss mitigation activities and could include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, forbearance and other actions intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Troubled debt restructurings completed during 2009 and included in nonperforming loans totaled $440 million at December 31, 2009. Purchased impaired loans are excluded from troubled debt restructurings.

(b) Excludes impaired loans acquired from National City totaling $.8 billion at December 31, 2009 and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2008. These loans are excluded as they were recorded at estimated fair value when acquired and are currently considered performing loans due to the accretion of interest in purchase accounting. (c) Excludes impaired loans acquired from National City totaling $2.7 billion at December 31, 2009 and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2008. These loans are excluded as they were recorded at estimated fair value when acquired and are currently considered performing loans due to the accretion of interest in purchase accounting. Loans that are not included in nonperforming or past due categories and which we are uncertain about the borrowers ability to comply with existing repayment terms over the next six months totaled $811 million at December 31, 2009 and $745 million at December 31, 2008. Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit We maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses to absorb losses from the loan portfolio. We determine the allowance based on quarterly assessments of the estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio. While we make allocations to specific loans and pools of loans, the total reserve is available for all loan and lease losses. There were no significant changes during 2009 to the process and procedures we follow to determine our allowance of loan and lease losses. We increased the allowance for loan and lease losses to $5.1 billion at December 31, 2009 compared with $3.9 billion at December 31, 2008. The allowance as a percent of nonperforming loans was 89% and as a percent of total loans was 3.22% at December 31, 2009. The comparable percentages at December 31, 2008 were 236% and 2.23%. 68 Although the allowance declined as a percentage of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2009 as compared with December 31, 2008, coverage is considered adequate given the mix of the loan portfolio. The majority of the commercial portfolio is secured by collateral, including loans to asset based lending customers that continue to show demonstrably lower loss given default. Further, the large high investment grade portion of the loan portfolio has performed well and has not been subject to significant deterioration. The allowance for loan and lease losses is significantly lower than it would have been otherwise due to the accounting treatment for purchased impaired loans. This treatment also results in a lower ratio of allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans. Loan loss reserves on the purchased impaired loans were not carried over on the date of acquisition. In addition, these loans were recorded net of $9.2 billion of fair value marks as of December 31, 2008. As a result, the ratio of allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans is lower than it would be otherwise. In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we maintain an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. We report this allowance as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We determine this amount using estimates of the probability of the ultimate funding and losses related to those credit exposures. This methodology is similar to the one we use for determining the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses. We refer you to Note 5 Asset Quality and Note 6 Purchased Impaired Loans Related to National City in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report regarding changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses and in the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. Also see the Allocation Of Allowance For Loan And Lease Losses table in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section of Item 8 of this Report for additional information included herein by reference. We establish specific allowances for loans considered impaired using a method prescribed by GAAP. All impaired loans except leases and large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans which may include but are not limited to credit card, residential mortgage, and consumer installment loans are subject to individual analysis. Specific allowances for individual loans are determined by our Special Asset Committee based on an analysis of the present value of expected future cash flows from the loans discounted at their effective interest rate, observable market price, or the fair value of the underlying collateral. Allocations to commercial and commercial real estate loans (pool reserve methodology) are assigned to pools of loans as defined by our business structure and are based on internal probability of default and loss given default credit risk ratings. Key elements of the pool reserve methodology include: Probability of default (PD), which is primarily based on historical default analyses and is derived from the borrowers internal PD credit risk rating; Exposure at default (EAD), which is derived from historical default data; and Loss given default (LGD), which is based on historical loss data, collateral value and other structural factors that may affect our ultimate ability to collect on the loan and is derived from the loans internal LGD credit risk rating. Our pool reserve methodology is sensitive to changes in key risk parameters such as PDs, LGDs and EADs. In general, a given change in any of the major risk parameters will have a corresponding change in the pool reserve allocations for non impaired commercial loans. Our commercial loans are the largest category of credits and are most sensitive to changes in the key risk parameters and pool reserve loss rates. To illustrate, if we increase the pool reserve loss rates by 5% for all categories of non impaired commercial loans, then the aggregate of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit would increase by $104 million. Additionally, other factors such as the rate of migration in the severity of problem loans will contribute to the final pool reserve allocations. We make consumer (including residential mortgage) loan reserve allocations within our business structure by consumer product line based on historical loss experience. We compute the allocation loss rates using the roll rate, historical loss or other appropriate loss calculation methodologies. We expect to see credit cost improvements in line with the pace of economic recovery in 2010. Charge Offs And Recoveries Year ended December 31Dollars in millions Charge offs Recoveries NetCharge offs Percent ofAverageLoans 2009 Commercial $ 1,276 $ 181 $ 1,095 1.79 % Commercial real estate 510 38 472 1.91 Equipment lease financing 149 27 122 1.97 Consumer 961 105 856 1.63 Residential real estate 259 93 166 .79 Total $ 3,155 $ 444 $ 2,711 1.64 2008 Commercial $ 301 $ 53 $ 248 .79 % Commercial real estate 165 10 155 1.65 Equipment lease financing 3 1 2 .08 Consumer 143 15 128 .62 Residential real estate 6 6 .07 Total $ 618 $ 79 $ 539 .74 69 We establish reserves to provide coverage for probable losses not considered in the specific, pool and consumer reserve methodologies, such as, but not limited to, the following: industry concentrations and conditions, credit quality trends, recent loss experience in particular sectors of the portfolio, ability and depth of lending management, changes in risk selection and underwriting standards, and timing of available information. Total net charge offs are significantly lower than they would have been otherwise due to the accounting treatment for purchased impaired loans. This treatment also results in a lower ratio of net charge offs to average loans. Customer balances related to these impaired loans were reduced by the fair value marks of $9.2 billion as of December 31, 2008. However, as a result of further credit deterioration on purchased impaired commercial loans, we recorded $90 million of net charge offs in 2009. CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS From a credit risk management perspective, we buy and sell credit loss protection via the use of credit derivatives. When we buy loss protection by purchasing a credit default swap (CDS), we pay a fee to the seller, or CDS counterparty, in return for the right to receive a payment if a specified credit event occurs for a particular obligor or reference entity. We purchase CDSs to mitigate the risk of economic loss on a portion of our loan exposures and for trading purposes. We also sell loss protection to mitigate the net premium cost and the impact of fair value accounting on the CDS in cases where we buy protection to hedge the loan portfolio and for trading purposes. These activities represent additional risk positions rather than hedges of risk. We approve counterparty credit lines for all of our trading activities, including CDSs. Counterparty credit lines are approved based on a review of credit quality in accordance with our traditional credit quality standards and credit policies. The credit risk of our counterparties is monitored in the normal course of business. In addition, all counterparty credit lines are subject to collateral thresholds and exposures above these thresholds are secured. CDSs are included in the Free Standing Derivatives table in the Financial Derivatives section of this Risk Management discussion. Net losses from CDSs for proprietary trading positions, reflected in other noninterest income on our Consolidated Income Statement, totaled $7 million for 2009 compared with net gains of $45 million for 2008. OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT Operational risk is defined as the risk of financial loss or other damage to us resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human factors, or from external events. Operational risk may occur in any of our business activities and manifests itself in various ways, including but not limited to the following: Errors related to transaction processing and systems, Breaches of the system of internal controls and compliance requirements, Misuse of sensitive information, and Business interruptions and execution of unauthorized transactions and fraud by employees or third parties. Operational losses may arise from legal actions due to operating deficiencies or noncompliance with contracts, laws or regulations. To monitor and control operational risk, we maintain a comprehensive framework including policies and a system of internal controls that is designed to manage risk and to provide management with timely and accurate information about the operations of PNC. Management at each business unit is primarily responsible for its operational risk management program, given that operational risk management is integral to direct business management and most easily effected at the business unit level. Corporate Operational Risk Management oversees day to day operational risk management activities. The technology risk management program is a significant component of the operational risk framework. We have an integrated security and technology risk management framework designed to help ensure a secure, sound, and compliant infrastructure for information management. The technology risk management process is aligned with the strategic direction of the businesses and is integrated into the technology management culture, structure and practices. The application of this framework across the enterprise helps to support comprehensive and reliable internal controls. Our business resiliency program manages the organizations capabilities to provide services in the case of an event that results in material disruption of business activities. Prioritization of investments in people, processes, technology and facilities is based on different types of events, business risk and criticality. Comprehensive testing validates our resiliency capabilities on an ongoing basis, and an integrated governance model is designed to help assure transparent management reporting. We believe our current operational risk level is in line with a moderate risk profile. As we complete the integration of National City and have doubled in size from a year ago, we are regularly evaluating key processes, technologies, and controls to help ensure they are performing at expected levels, and can support growing business and product requirements in a stable, well controlled manner. Insurance As a component of our risk management practices, we purchase insurance designed to protect us against accidental 70 loss or losses which, in the aggregate, may significantly affect personnel, property, financial objectives, or our ability to continue to meet our responsibilities to our various stakeholder groups. PNC, through a subsidiary company, Alpine Indemnity Limited, provides insurance coverage for its general liability, automobile liability, management liability, fidelity, employment practices liability, special crime, workers compensation, property and terrorism programs. PNCs risks associated with its participation as an insurer for these programs are mitigated through policy limits and annual aggregate limits. Risks in excess of Alpines policy limits and annual aggregates are mitigated through the purchase of direct coverage provided by various insurers up to limits established by PNCs Corporate Insurance Committee. LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT Liquidity risk is the risk of potential loss if we were unable to meet our funding requirements at a reasonable cost. We manage liquidity risk at the bank and parent company to help ensure that we can obtain cost effective funding to meet current and future obligations under both normal business as usual and stressful circumstances. Our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the deposit base that comes from our retail and corporate banking businesses. Other borrowed funds come from a diverse mix of short and long term funding sources. Liquid assets and unused borrowing capacity from a number of sources are also available to maintain our liquidity position. Liquid assets consist of short term investments (Federal funds sold, resale agreements, trading securities, and interest earning deposits with banks) and securities available for sale. At December 31, 2009, our liquid assets totaled $59.8 billion, with $23.4 billion pledged as collateral for borrowings, trust, and other commitments. Bank Level Liquidity Spot and forward funding gap analyses are the primary metrics used to measure and monitor bank liquidity risk. Funding gaps represent the difference in projected sources of liquidity available to offset projected uses. We calculate funding gaps for the overnight, thirty day, ninety day, one hundred eighty day and one year time intervals. Risk limits are established within the Liquidity Risk policy. Compliance is regularly reviewed by managements Asset and Liability Committee. PNC Bank, N.A. can borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Clevelands (Federal Reserve Bank) discount window to meet short term liquidity requirements. These borrowings are secured by securities and commercial loans. PNC Bank, N.A. is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) Pittsburgh and as such has access to advances from FHLB Pittsburgh secured generally by residential mortgage and other mortgage related loans. At December 31, 2009, our unused secured borrowing capacity was $26.0 billion with the Federal Reserve Bank and $9.3 billion with FHLB Pittsburgh. Total FHLB borrowings were $10.8 billion at December 31, 2009 compared with $18.1 billion at December 31, 2008. We can also obtain funding through traditional forms of borrowing, including Federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements, and short and long term debt issuances. PNC Bank, N.A. has the ability to offer up to $20 billion in senior and subordinated unsecured debt obligations with maturities of more than nine months. Through December 31, 2009, PNC Bank, N.A. had issued $6.9 billion of debt under this program. PNC Bank, N.A. also has the ability to offer up to $3.0 billion of its commercial paper. As of December 31, 2009, there were no issuances outstanding under this program. As of December 31, 2009, there were $6.2 billion of bank short and long term debt issuances with maturities of less than one year. In December 2009, as required by the FDIC, we prepaid deposit insurance assessments covering the period October 1, 2009 through December 31, 2012. The amount of the prepayment was $1.1 billion. While the resulting prepaid asset does not require risk based capital, it impacts our available bank liquidity. Parent Company Liquidity Our parent companys routine funding needs consist primarily of dividends to PNC shareholders, share repurchases, debt service, the funding of non bank affiliates, and acquisitions. Parent company liquidity guidelines are designed to help ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet our funding requirements over the succeeding 24 month period. Risk limits for parent company liquidity are established within the Enterprise Capital Management Policy. Compliance is regularly reviewed by the Board of Directors Joint Risk Committee. The principal source of parent company cash flow is the dividends it receives from its subsidiary bank, which may be impacted by the following: Bank level capital needs, Laws and regulations, Corporate policies, Contractual restrictions, and Other factors. Also, there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of national banks to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the parent company or its non bank subsidiaries. See Note 23 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for a further discussion of these limitations. 71 Dividends may also be impacted by the banks capital needs and by contractual restrictions. We provide additional information on certain contractual restrictions under the Perpetual Trust Securities, PNC Capital Trust E Trust Preferred Securities, and Acquired Entity Trust Preferred Securities sections of the Off Balance Sheet Arrangements And Variable Interest Entities section of this Item 7. The amount available for dividend payments to the parent company by PNC Bank, N.A. without prior regulatory approval was approximately $378 million at December 31, 2009. In addition to dividends from PNC Bank, N.A., other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and short term investments, as well as dividends and loan repayments from other subsidiaries and dividends or distributions from equity investments. As of December 31, 2009, the parent company had approximately $4.7 billion in funds available from its cash and short term investments. We can also generate liquidity for the parent company and PNCs non bank subsidiaries through the issuance of debt and equity securities in public or private markets. PNC Funding Corp issued the following securities during 2009: September $500 million of senior notes due September 2015; interest paid semiannually at a fixed rate of 4.25%. June $600 million of senior notes due June 2019; interest paid semiannually at a fixed rate of 6.7%. June $400 million of senior notes due June 2014; interest paid semiannually at a fixed rate of 5.4%. March $1.0 billion of floating rate senior notes due April 2012 under the TLGP Debt Guarantee Program. Interest will be reset quarterly to 3 month LIBOR plus 20 basis points and paid quarterly. These senior notes are guaranteed by the parent company and by the FDIC and are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America through maturity. As further described in the Executive Summary and Consolidated Balance Sheet sections of this Item 7, in May 2009 we raised $624 million in common equity through the issuance of 15 million shares of common stock. PNC Bank, N.A., through its subsidiary PNC Funding Corp, has the ability to offer up to $3.0 billion of commercial paper to provide the parent company with additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2009, there were no issuances outstanding under this program. As of December 31, 2009, there were $1.1 billion of parent company contractual obligations with maturities of less than one year. We have effective shelf registration statements pursuant to which we can issue additional debt and equity securities, including certain hybrid capital instruments. February 2010 Actions On February 8, 2010, we raised $3.0 billion in new common equity through the issuance of 55.6 million shares of common stock in an underwritten offering at $54 per share. On March 4, 2010, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 8.3 million shares of common stock at the offering price of $54 per share, totaling approximately $450 million, to cover over allotments. We expect to complete this issuance on March 11, 2010. Also on February 8, 2010 PNC Funding Corp issued the following securities: $1 billion of senior notes due February 2015; interest will be paid semiannually at a fixed rate of 3.625%. $1 billion of senior notes due February 2020; interest will be paid semiannually at a fixed rate of 5.125%. As approved by the Federal Reserve Board, US Treasury and our other banking regulators, on February 10, 2010, we redeemed all 75,792 shares of our Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Shares, Series N (Series N Preferred Stock) issued to the US Treasury on December 31, 2008 totaling $7.6 billion. We used the net proceeds from the common stock and senior notes offerings described above and other parent company funds to redeem the Series N Preferred Stock. Dividends of $89 million were paid on February 10, 2010 when the Series N Preferred Stock was redeemed. PNC paid total dividends of $421 million to the US Treasury while the Series N Preferred Stock was outstanding. In connection with the redemption of the Series N Preferred Stock, we accelerated the accretion of the remaining issuance discount on the Series N Preferred Stock and recorded a corresponding reduction in retained earnings of $250.0 million. This resulted in a one time, noncash reduction in net income available to common stockholders and related basic and diluted earnings per share. This transaction will be reflected in our consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of 2010. We did not exercise our right to seek to repurchase the related warrant to purchase common shares at the time we redeemed the Series N Preferred Stock. See Note 19 Equity in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for more details regarding the issuance of Series N Preferred Stock, related issuance discount and the warrant to purchase common shares to the US Treasury under the TARP Capital Purchase Program. Status of Credit Ratings The cost and availability of short and long term funding, as well as collateral requirements for certain derivative instruments, is influenced by debt ratings. A decrease, or potential decrease, in credit ratings could impact access to the capital markets and or increase the cost of debt, and thereby adversely affect liquidity and financial condition. 72 Credit ratings as of December 31, 2009 follow: Moodys Standard & Poors Fitch The PNC FinancialServices Group, Inc. Senior debt A3 A A+ Subordinated debt Baa1 A A Preferred stock (a) Baa2 BBB A PNC Bank, N.A. Subordinated debt A2 A A Long term deposits A1 A+ AA Short term deposits P 1 A 1 F1+ (a) Effective February 17, 2010, Moodys revised the rating on preferred stock to Baa3 from Baa2. Commitments The following tables set forth contractual obligations and various other commitments representing required and potential cash outflows as of December 31, 2009.

At December 31, 2009, the liability for uncertain tax positions, excluding associated interest and penalties, was $227 million. This liability represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, this estimated liability has been excluded from the contractual obligations table.

We are exposed to market risk primarily by our involvement in the following activities, among others: Traditional banking activities of taking deposits and extending loans, Private equity and other investments and activities whose economic values are directly impacted by market factors, and Trading in fixed income products, equities, derivatives, and foreign exchange, as a result of customer activities, underwriting, and proprietary trading. We have established enterprise wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor, and report market risk. Market Risk Management provides independent oversight by monitoring compliance with these limits and guidelines, and reporting significant risks in the business to the Risk Committee of the Board. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT INTEREST RATE RISK Interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates, and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of our noninterest bearing funding sources. Due to the repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities. Asset and Liability Management centrally manages interest rate risk within limits and guidelines set forth in our risk management policies approved by managements Asset and Liability Committee and the Joint Risk Committee of the Board. Sensitivity results and market interest rate benchmarks for the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008 follow: Interest Sensitivity Analysis Fourth Quarter2009 FourthQuarter2008 Net Interest Income Sensitivity Simulation Effect on net interest income in first year from gradual interest rate change over following 12 months of: 100 basis point increase 1.1 % (0.7 )% 100 basis point decrease (a) (2.0 )% (0.5 )% Effect on net interest income in second year from gradual interest rate change over the preceding 12 months of: 100 basis point increase 1.4 % 1.9 % 100 basis point decrease (a) (6.0 )% (3.1 )% Duration of Equity Model (a) Base case duration of equity (in years): (1.2 ) (5.2 ) Key Period End Interest Rates One month LIBOR .23 % .44 % Three year swap 2.06 % 1.76 % (a) Not meaningful. Given the inherent limitations in certain of these measurement tools and techniques, results become less meaningful as interest rates approach zero. In addition to measuring the effect on net interest income assuming parallel changes in current interest rates, we routinely simulate the effects of a number of nonparallel interest rate environments. The following Net Interest Income Sensitivity To Alternative Rate Scenarios table reflects the percentage change in net interest income over the next two 12 month periods assuming (i) the PNC Economists most likely rate forecast, (ii) implied market forward rates, and (iii) a Two Ten Inversion (a 200 basis point inversion between two year and ten year rates superimposed on current base rates) scenario. 74 Net Interest Income Sensitivity To Alternative Rate Scenarios (Fourth Quarter 2009) PNCEconomist MarketForward Two TenInversion First year sensitivity .9 % .6 % .9 % Second year sensitivity (1.4 )% (1.3 )% .3 % All changes in forecasted net interest income are relative to results in a base rate scenario where current market rates are assumed to remain unchanged over the forecast horizon. When forecasting net interest income, we make assumptions about interest rates and the shape of the yield curve, the volume and characteristics of new business, and the behavior of existing on and off balance sheet positions. These assumptions determine the future level of simulated net interest income in the base interest rate scenario and the other interest rate scenarios presented in the following table. These simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature, they are replaced or repriced at then current market rates. The following graph presents the yield curves for the base rate scenario and each of the alternate scenarios one year forward. The results of the interest sensitivity analyses reflect our current best estimates of the impact of integrating National Citys balance sheet, including the effects of purchase accounting, balance sheet repositioning, and deposit pricing strategies. Going forward as these estimates and strategies are revised, the results of our analyses may change. The fourth quarter 2008 analyses also reflect the impact of the rapid decline in market interest rates that occurred during that quarter, in which period end one month LIBOR and three year swap rates declined 349 basis points and 197 basis points, respectively. The fourth quarter 2009 interest sensitivity analyses indicate that our Consolidated Balance Sheet is positioned to benefit from an increase in interest rates. We believe that we have the deposit funding base and balance sheet flexibility to adjust, where appropriate and permissible, to changing interest rates and market conditions. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT TRADING RISK Our trading activities include customer driven trading in fixed income securities, equities, derivatives, and foreign exchange contracts. They also include the underwriting of fixed income and equity securities and proprietary trading. We use value at risk (VaR) as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in trading activities. The Risk Committee of the Board establishes an enterprise wide VaR limit on our trading activities. During 2009, our VaR ranged between $5.8 million and $10.4 million, averaging $7.7 million. During 2008, our VaR ranged between $5.4 million and $18.4 million, averaging $10.8 million. To help ensure the integrity of the models used to calculate VaR for each portfolio and enterprise wide, we use a process known as backtesting. The backtesting process consists of comparing actual observations of trading related gains or losses against the VaR levels that were calculated at the close of the prior day. Under typical market conditions, we would expect an average of two to three instances a year in which actual losses exceeded the prior day VaR measure at the enterprise wide level. There were no such instances during 2009. As a result of increased volatility in certain markets, there were 10 such instances during 2008. The following graph shows a comparison of enterprise wide trading related gains and losses against prior day VaR for the period. Total trading revenue was as follows: Year end December 31 in millions 2009 2008 2007 Net interest income $ 61 $ 72 $ 7 Noninterest income 170 (55 ) 104 Total trading revenue $ 231 $ 17 $ 111 Securities underwriting and trading (a) $ 75 $ (17 ) $ 41 Foreign exchange 73 73 58 Financial derivatives 83 (39 ) 12 Total trading revenue $ 231 $ 17 $ 111 (a) Includes changes in fair value for certain loans accounted for at fair value. 75 Trading revenue excludes the impact of economic hedging activities, which related primarily to residential mortgage servicing rights and residential and commercial real estate loans. Improved valuations resulted in better trading results in 2009 compared with 2008. Lower trading revenue in 2008 was primarily related to our proprietary trading activities and reflected the negative impact of a very illiquid market on the assets that we held during the first quarter of 2008. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENT RISK Equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. In addition to extending credit, taking deposits, and underwriting and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations, and later stage growth financings in a variety of industries. We also have investments in affiliated and non affiliated funds that make similar investments in private equity and in debt and equity oriented hedge funds. The economic and or book value of these investments and other assets such as loan servicing rights are directly affected by changes in market factors. The primary risk measurement for equity and other investments is economic capital. Economic capital is a common measure of risk for credit, market and operational risk. It is an estimate of the worst case value depreciation over a one year horizon to a level commensurate with a financial institution with an A rating by the credit rating agencies. Given the illiquid nature of many of these types of investments, it can be a challenge to determine their fair values. Market Risk Management and Finance provide independent oversight of the valuation process. Various PNC business units manage our private equity and other investment activities. Our businesses are responsible for making investment decisions within the approved policy limits and associated guidelines. BlackRock PNC owns approximately 44 million common stock equivalent shares of BlackRock equity, accounted for under the equity method. Our investment in BlackRock was $5.8 billion at December 31, 2009 compared with $4.2 billion at December 31, 2008. The market value of our investment in BlackRock was $10.1 billion at December 31, 2009. The primary risk measurement, similar to other equity investments, is economic capital. The discussion of BlackRock within the Business Segments Review section of this Item 7 includes information about changes in our ownership structure of BlackRock during 2009 and BlackRocks December 1, 2009 acquisition of BGI. Tax Credit Investments Included in our equity investments are tax credit investments. These investments, as well as equity investments held by consolidated partnerships, totaled $2.5 billion at December 31, 2009 and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2008. Investments accounted for under the equity method totaled $2.0 billion while investments accounted for under the cost method totaled $488 million at December 31, 2009. The comparable amounts at December 31, 2008 were $1.7 billion and $648 million. Visa At December 31, 2009, our investment in Visa Class B common shares totaled approximately 23 million shares. Considering the adjustment to the conversion ratio due to settled litigation reported by Visa, these shares would convert to approximately 13.6 million of the publicly traded Visa Class A common shares. As of December 31, 2009, we had recognized $456 million of our Visa ownership, which we acquired with National City, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Based on the December 31, 2009 closing price of $87.46 for the Visa shares the market value of our investment was $1.2 billion. The Visa Class B common shares we own generally will not be transferable, except under limited circumstances, until they can be converted into shares of the publicly traded class of stock, which cannot happen until the later of three years after the IPO or settlement of all of the specified litigation. It is expected that Visa will continue to adjust the conversion ratio of Visa Class B to Class A shares in connection with settlements in excess of any amounts then in escrow for that purpose and will also reduce the conversion ratio to the extent that it adds any funds to the escrow in the future. In July 2009, Visa funded $700 million to the litigation escrow account and reduced the conversion ratio of Visa B to A shares. We consequently recognized our estimated $66 million share of the $700 million as a reduction of our indemnification liability and a reduction of noninterest expense. Note 25 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report has further information on our Visa indemnification obligation. Private Equity The private equity portfolio is an illiquid portfolio comprised of equity and mezzanine investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment. Private equity investments are reported at fair value. Changes in the values of private equity investments are reflected in our results of operations. Due to the nature of the investments, the valuations incorporate assumptions as to future performance, financial condition, liquidity, availability of capital, and market conditions, among other factors, to determine the estimated fair value of the investments. Market conditions and actual performance of the investments could differ from these assumptions. 76 Accordingly, lower valuations may occur that could adversely impact earnings in future periods. Also, the valuations may not represent amounts that will ultimately be realized from these investments. See Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 8 Fair Value in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $1.2 billion at both December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2009, $595 million was invested directly in a variety of companies and $589 million was invested indirectly through various private equity funds. Included in direct investments are investment activities of two private equity funds that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes. The noncontrolling interests of these funds totaled $135 million as of December 31, 2009. The indirect private equity funds are not redeemable, but PNC receives distributions over the life of the partnership from liquidation of the underlying investments by the investee. Our unfunded commitments related to private equity totaled $453 million at December 31, 2009 compared with $540 million at December 31, 2008. Other Investments We also make investments in affiliated and non affiliated funds with both traditional and alternative investment strategies. The economic values could be driven by either the fixed income market or the equity markets, or both. At December 31, 2009, other investments totaled $824 million compared with $853 million at December 31, 2008. We recognized net losses related to these investments of $37 million during 2009. Given the nature of these investments and if current market conditions affecting their valuation were to continue or worsen, we could incur future losses. Our unfunded commitments related to other investments totaled $66 million at December 31, 2009 and $178 million at December 31, 2008. IMPACT OF INFLATION Our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. Accordingly, future changes in prices do not affect the obligations to pay or receive fixed and determinable amounts of money. During periods of inflation, monetary assets lose value in terms of purchasing power and monetary liabilities have corresponding purchasing power gains. The concept of purchasing power, however, is not an adequate indicator of the effect of inflation on banks because it does not take into account changes in interest rates, which are an important determinant of our earnings. FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES We use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage interest rate, market and credit risk inherent in our business activities. Substantially all such instruments are used to manage risk related to changes in interest rates. Interest rate and total return swaps, swaptions, interest rate caps and floors and futures contracts are the primary instruments we use for interest rate risk management. Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, interest rate, market and credit risk. For interest rate swaps, total return swaps and futures contracts, only periodic cash payments and, with respect to swaptions and interest rate caps and floors, premiums are exchanged. Therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount on these instruments. Further information on our financial derivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 17 Financial Derivatives in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report and is incorporated here by reference. Not all elements of interest rate, market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial or other derivatives, and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market changes, among other reasons. 77 The following tables provide the notional or contractual amounts and estimated net fair value of financial derivatives used for risk management and designated as accounting hedges as well as free standing derivatives at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008.

(d) Includes PNCs obligation to fund a portion of certain BlackRock LTIP programs. 78 2008 VERSUS 2007 CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW Summary Results Net income for 2008 was $914 million or $2.44 per diluted share and for 2007 was $1.491 billion or $4.32 per diluted share. Net Interest Income Net interest income was $3.9 billion for 2008 compared with $2.9 billion for 2007, an increase of $907 million, or 31%. The 31% increase in net interest income for 2008 compared with 2007 was favorably impacted by the $16.5 billion, or 17%, increase in average interest earning assets and a decrease in funding costs. The 2008 net interest margin was positively affected by declining rates paid on deposits and borrowings compared with the prior year. The net interest margin was 3.37% in 2008 and 3.00% for 2007, an increase of 37 basis points. Noninterest Income Summary Noninterest income was $2.4 billion for 2008 and $2.9 billion for 2007. Noninterest income for 2008 included the following: Gains of $246 million related to the mark to market adjustment on our BlackRock LTIP shares obligation, Losses related to our commercial mortgage loans held for sale of $197 million, net of hedges, Impairment and other losses related to alternative investments of $156 million, Income from Hilliard Lyons totaling $164 million, including the first quarter gain of $114 million from the sale of this business, Net securities losses of $206 million, A first quarter gain of $95 million related to the redemption of a portion of our Visa Class B common shares related to Visas March 2008 initial public offering, A third quarter $61 million reversal of a legal contingency reserve established in connection with an acquisition due to a settlement, Trading losses of $55 million, A $35 million impairment charge on commercial mortgage servicing rights, and Equity management losses of $24 million. Noninterest income for 2007 included the following: The impact of $82 million gain recognized in connection with our transfer of BlackRock shares to satisfy a portion of PNCs LTIP obligation and a $209 million net loss on our LTIP shares obligation, Income from Hilliard Lyons totaling $227 million, Trading income of $104 million, and Equity management gains of $102 million. Apart from the impact of these items, noninterest income decreased $89 million in 2008 compared with 2007. Additional analysis Asset management fees totaled $686 million in 2008, a decline of $98 million compared with 2007. The effect on fees of lower equity earnings from BlackRock, a $12 billion decrease in assets managed due to equity values related to wealth management, and the Hilliard Lyons divestiture were reflected in the decline compared with 2007. Excluding $53 billion of assets acquired on December 31, 2008 resulting from our acquisition of National City, assets managed at December 31, 2008 totaled $57 billion compared with $74 billion at December 31, 2007. The Hilliard Lyons sale and the impact of comparatively lower equity markets in 2008 drove the decline in assets managed. Consumer services fees declined $69 million, to $623 million, for 2008 compared with 2007. The sale of Hilliard Lyons more than offset the benefits of increased volume related fees, including debit card, credit card, bank brokerage and merchant revenues. Corporate services revenue totaled $704 million in 2008 compared with $713 million in 2007. Higher revenue from treasury management and other fees were more than offset by lower merger and acquisition advisory fees and commercial mortgage servicing fees, net of amortization. Service charges on deposits grew $24 million, to $372 million, in 2008 compared with 2007. The impact of our expansion into new markets contributed to the increase during 2008. Net gains on sales of securities totaled $106 million in 2008 compared with $1 million in 2007. Other noninterest income totaled $263 million for 2008 compared with $412 million for 2007. Other noninterest income for 2008 included gains of $246 million related to our BlackRock LTIP shares adjustment, the $114 million gain from the sale of Hilliard Lyons, the $95 million gain from the redemption of a portion of our investment in Visa related to its March 2008 initial public offering, and the $61 million reversal of a legal contingency reserve referred to above. The impact of these items was partially offset by losses related to our commercial mortgage loans held for sale of $197 million, net of hedges, trading losses of $55 million and equity management losses of $24 million. Other noninterest income for 2007 included a net loss related to our BlackRock investment of $127 million (the net of the two items described within the Summary section above), trading income of $104 million, equity management 79 gains of $102 million and gains related to our commercial mortgage loans held for sale, net of hedges, of $3 million. Provision For Credit Losses The provision for credit losses totaled $1.5 billion for 2008 compared with $315 million for 2007. Of the total 2008 provision, $990 million was recorded in the fourth quarter, including $504 million of additional provision recorded on December 31, 2008 to conform the National City loan reserving methodology with ours. The differences in methodology include granularity of loss computations, statistical and quantitative factors rather than qualitative assessment, and the extent of current appraisals and risk assessments. In addition to the impact of National City, the higher provision in 2008 compared with the prior year was driven by general credit quality migration, including residential real estate development and commercial real estate exposure, an increase in net charge offs, and growth in nonperforming loans. Growth in our total credit exposure also contributed to the higher provision amounts in both comparisons. Noninterest Expense Total noninterest expense was $3.685 billion for 2008 and $3.652 billion for 2007, an increase of $33 million, or 1%. Higher noninterest expense in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily resulted from investments in growth initiatives, including acquisitions, partially offset by the impact of the sale of Hilliard Lyons and disciplined expense management. Integration costs included in noninterest expense totaled $115 million for 2008, including $79 million in the fourth quarter, and $102 million for 2007. Fourth quarter 2008 integration costs included $71 million related to our National City acquisition. Noninterest expense for 2008 included the benefit of the reversal of $46 million of the $82 million Visa indemnification liability that we established in the fourth quarter of 2007. EFFECTIVE TAX RATE Our effective tax rate was 27.2% for 2008 and 29.2% for 2007. CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET REVIEW Loans Loans increased $107.2 billion as of December 31, 2008 compared with December 31, 2007. Our National City acquisition added $99.7 billion of loans, including $34.3 billion of commercial, $16.0 billion of commercial real estate, $30.5 billion of consumer and $10.6 billion of residential mortgage loans. Investment Securities Total investment securities at December 31, 2008 were $43.5 billion compared with $30.2 billion at December 31, 2007. Securities added with the National City acquisition at December 31, 2008 totaled $13.3 billion and were primarily US government agency residential mortgage backed securities. Securities represented 15% of total assets at December 31, 2008 and 22% of total assets at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2008, the investment securities balance included a net unrealized loss of $5.4 billion, which represented the difference between fair value and amortized cost. The comparable amount at December 31, 2007 was a net unrealized loss of $265 million. The expected weighted average life of investment securities (excluding corporate stocks and other) was 3 years and 1 month at December 31, 2008 and 3 years and 6 months at December 31, 2007. Loans Held For Sale Loans held for sale totaled $4.4 billion at December 31, 2008 compared with $3.9 billion at December 31, 2007. The acquisition of National City added approximately $2.2 billion of loans held for sale at December 31, 2008, primarily 1 4 family conforming residential mortgages. Loans held for sale included education loans held for sale of $1.5 billion at December 31, 2007. We transferred these loans at lower of cost or market value from held for sale to the loan portfolio in February 2008 due to the impact at that time of liquidity issues on the secondary markets for education loans. Asset Quality Total nonperforming assets at December 31, 2008 increased $1.7 billion, to $2.2 billion, from the balance at December 31, 2007. Our nonperforming assets represented .75% of total assets at December 31, 2008 compared with .36% at December 31, 2007. The increase in nonperforming assets reflected higher nonaccrual residential real estate development loans and loans in related sectors, and the addition of $738 million of nonperforming assets related to National City. At December 31, 2008, our largest nonperforming asset was approximately $36 million and our average nonperforming loan associated with commercial lending was less than $1 million. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The sum of goodwill and other intangible assets increased $2.1 billion at December 31, 2008 compared with the prior year end, to $11.7 billion. We added $.6 billion of core deposit and other relationship intangible assets and $1.2 billion of mortgage servicing rights in connection with the National City acquisition at December 31, 2008. In addition, our Sterling acquisition added $.6 billion of goodwill during 2008. Our Hilliard Lyons divestiture reduced goodwill by $.1 billion in 2008. 80 Funding Sources Total funding sources were $245.1 billion at December 31, 2008 and $113.6 billion at December 31, 2007. Funding sources increased $131.5 billion as total deposits increased $110.2 billion and total borrowed funds increased $21.3 billion. Our acquisition of National City added $104.0 billion of deposits and $18.2 billion of borrowed funds at December 31, 2008. In addition, borrowed funds at that date included $2.9 billion of senior notes issued in December 2008 and guaranteed under the FDICs TLGP Debt Guarantee Program. Shareholders Equity Total shareholders equity increased $10.6 billion, to $25.4 billion, at December 31, 2008 compared with December 31, 2007 and reflected the following: The December 2008 issuance of $7.6 billion of preferred stock and a common stock warrant to the US Department of Treasury under the TARP Capital Purchase Program, The December 2008 issuance of $5.6 billion of common stock in connection with the National City acquisition, The May 2008 issuance of $500 million of Series K preferred stock, The April 2008 issuance of $312 million of common stock in connection with the Sterling acquisition, and The December 2008 issuance of $150 million of Series L preferred stock in connection with the National City acquisition. These factors were partially offset by the $3.8 billion increase from December 31, 2007 in accumulated other comprehensive loss which included $3.5 billion of net unrealized securities losses. Regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2008 were 17.5% for leverage, 9.7% for Tier 1 risk based and 13.2% for total risk based capital. At December 31, 2007, the regulatory capital ratios were 6.2% for leverage, 6.8% for Tier 1 risk based and 10.3% for total risk based capital. The leverage ratio at December 31, 2008 reflected the favorable impact on Tier I risk based capital from the issuance of securities under TARP and the issuance of PNC common stock in connection with the National City acquisition, both of which occurred on December 31, 2008. In addition, the ratio as of that date did not reflect any impact of National City on PNCs adjusted average total assets. Glossary of Terms Accretable net interest The excess of cash flows expected to be collected on a purchased impaired loan over the carrying value of the loan. The accretable net interest is recognized into interest income over the remaining life of the loan using the constant effective yield method. Accretable yield The excess of a loans cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying value of the loan. The accretable yield is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan using the constant effective yield method. Adjusted average total assets Primarily comprised of total average quarterly (or annual) assets plus (less) unrealized losses (gains) on investment securities, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (net of eligible deferred taxes). Annualized Adjusted to reflect a full year of activity. Assets under management Assets over which we have sole or shared investment authority for our customers/clients. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Basis point One hundredth of a percentage point. Cash recoveries Cash recoveries used in the context of purchased impaired loans represent cash payments from customers that exceeded the recorded investment of the designated impaired loan. Charge off Process of removing a loan or portion of a loan from our balance sheet because it is considered uncollectible. We also record a charge off when a loan is transferred to held for sale by reducing the loan carrying amount to the fair value of the loan, if fair value is less than carrying amount. Client related noninterest income Total noninterest income included on our Consolidated Income Statement less amounts for net gains (losses) on sales of securities, net other than temporary impairments, and other noninterest income. Common shareholders equity to total assets Common shareholders equity divided by total assets. Common shareholders equity equals total shareholders equity less the liquidation value of preferred stock. Credit derivatives Contractual agreements, primarily credit default swaps, that provide protection against a credit event of one or more referenced credits. The nature of a credit event is established by the protection buyer and protection seller at the inception of a transaction, and such events include bankruptcy, insolvency and failure to meet payment obligations when due. The buyer of the credit derivative pays a periodic fee in return for a payment by the protection seller upon the occurrence, if any, of a credit event. Credit spread The difference in yield between debt issues of similar maturity. The excess of yield attributable to credit spread is often used as a measure of relative creditworthiness, with a reduction in the credit spread reflecting an improvement in the borrowers perceived creditworthiness. 81 Derivatives Financial contracts whose value is derived from publicly traded securities, interest rates, currency exchange rates or market indices. Derivatives cover a wide assortment of financial contracts, including but not limited to forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Duration of equity An estimate of the rate sensitivity of our economic value of equity. A negative duration of equity is associated with asset sensitivity (i.e., positioned for rising interest rates), while a positive value implies liability sensitivity (i.e., positioned for declining interest rates). For example, if the duration of equity is +1.5 years, the economic value of equity declines by 1.5% for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates. Earning assets Assets that generate income, which include: Federal funds sold; resale agreements; trading securities; interest earning deposits with banks; other short term investments; loans held for sale; loans; investment securities; and certain other assets. Economic capital Represents the amount of resources that a business segment should hold to guard against potentially large losses that could cause insolvency. It is based on a measurement of economic risk, as opposed to risk as defined by regulatory bodies. The economic capital measurement process involves converting a risk distribution to the capital that is required to support the risk, consistent with our target credit rating. As such, economic risk serves as a common currency of risk that allows us to compare different risks on a similar basis. Effective duration A measurement, expressed in years, that, when multiplied by a change in interest rates, would approximate the percentage change in value of on and off balance sheet positions. Efficiency Noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income (GAAP basis) and noninterest income. Fair value The price that would be received to sell an asset or the price that would be paid to transfer a liability on the measurement date using the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants. Foreign exchange contracts Contracts that provide for the future receipt and delivery of foreign currency at previously agreed upon terms. Funds transfer pricing A management accounting methodology designed to recognize the net interest income effects of sources and uses of funds provided by the assets and liabilities of a business segment. We assign these balances LIBOR based funding rates at origination that represent the interest cost for us to raise/invest funds with similar maturity and repricing structures. Futures and forward contracts Contracts in which the buyer agrees to purchase and the seller agrees to deliver a specific financial instrument at a predetermined price or yield. May be settled either in cash or by delivery of the underlying financial instrument. GAAP Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Interest rate floors and caps Interest rate protection instruments that involve payment from the protection seller to the protection buyer of an interest differential, which represents the difference between a short term rate (e.g., three month LIBOR) and an agreed upon rate (the strike rate) applied to a notional principal amount. Interest rate swap contracts Contracts that are entered into primarily as an asset/liability management strategy to reduce interest rate risk. Interest rate swap contracts are exchanges of interest rate payments, such as fixed rate payments for floating rate payments, based on notional principal amounts. Intrinsic value The amount by which the fair value of an underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of an option on that stock. Investment securities Collectively, securities available for sale and securities held to maturity. Leverage ratio Tier 1 risk based capital divided by adjusted average total assets. LIBOR Acronym for London InterBank Offered Rate. LIBOR is the average interest rate charged when banks in the London wholesale money market (or interbank market) borrow unsecured funds from each other. LIBOR rates are used as a benchmark for interest rates on a global basis. Net interest income from loans and deposits A management accounting assessment, using funds transfer pricing methodology, of the net interest contribution from loans and deposits. Net interest margin Annualized taxable equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets. Nonaccretable difference Contractually required payments receivable on a purchased impaired loan in excess of the cash flows expected to be collected. Nondiscretionary assets under administration Assets we hold for our customers/clients in a non discretionary, custodial capacity. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Noninterest income to total revenue Noninterest income divided by the sum of net interest income (GAAP basis) and noninterest income. 82 Nonperforming assets Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructured loans, foreclosed assets and other assets. We do not accrue interest income on assets classified as nonperforming. Nonperforming loans Nonperforming loans include loans to commercial, commercial real estate, equipment lease financing, consumer, and residential mortgage customers and construction customers as well as troubled debt restructured loans. Nonperforming loans do not include loans held for sale or foreclosed and other assets. We do not accrue interest income on loans classified as nonperforming. Notional amount A number of currency units, shares, or other units specified in a derivatives contract. Operating leverage The period to period dollar or percentage change in total revenue (GAAP basis) less the dollar or percentage change in noninterest expense. A positive variance indicates that revenue growth exceeded expense growth (i.e., positive operating leverage) while a negative variance implies expense growth exceeded revenue growth (i.e., negative operating leverage). Options Contracts that grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right, but not the obligation, to either purchase or sell the associated financial instrument at a set price during a specified period or at a specified date in the future. Other than temporary impairment (OTTI) When the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost basis, an assessment is performed to determine whether the impairment is other than temporary. If we intend to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss, an other than temporary impairment is considered to have occurred. In such cases, an other than temporary impairment is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investments amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. Further, if we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security, an other than temporary impairment is considered to have occurred. However for debt securities, if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its recovery, the other than temporary loss is separated into (a) the amount representing the credit loss, and (b) the amount related to all other factors. The other than temporary impairment related to credit losses is recognized in earnings while the amount related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax. Pretax, pre provision earnings Total revenue less noninterest expense. Purchase accounting accretion Accretion of the discounts and premiums on acquired assets and liabilities. The purchase accounting accretion is recognized in net interest income over the weighted average life of the financial instruments using the constant effective yield method. Purchased impaired loans Acquired loans determined to be credit impaired under FASB ASC 310 30 (AICPA SOP 03 3). Loans are determined to be impaired if there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected. Recorded investment The initial investment of a purchased impaired loan plus interest accretion and less any cash payments and writedowns to date. The recorded investment excludes any valuation allowance which is included in our allowance for loan and lease losses. Recovery Cash proceeds received on a loan that we had previously charged off. We credit the amount received to the allowance for loan and lease losses. Residential development loans Project specific loans to commercial customers for the construction or development of residential real estate including land, single family homes, condominiums and other residential properties. This would exclude loans to commercial customers where proceeds are for general corporate purposes whether or not such facilities are secured. Residential mortgage servicing rights hedge gains / (losses), net We have elected to measure acquired or originated residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) at fair value under GAAP. We employ a risk management strategy designed to protect the economic value of MSRs from changes in interest rates. This strategy utilizes securities and a portfolio of derivative instruments to hedge changes in the fair value of MSRs arising from changes in interest rates. These financial instruments are expected to have changes in fair value which are negatively correlated to the change in fair value of the MSR portfolio. Net MSR hedge gains/ (losses) represent the change in the fair value of MSRs, exclusive of changes due to time decay and payoffs, combined with the change in the fair value of the associated derivative instruments. Return on average assets Annualized net income divided by average assets. Return on average capital Annualized net income divided by average capital. Return on average common shareholders equity Annualized net income less preferred stock dividends, including preferred stock discount accretion, divided by average common shareholders equity. 83 Risk weighted assets Computed by the assignment of specific risk weights (as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) to assets and off balance sheet instruments. Securitization The process of legally transforming financial assets into securities. Servicing rights An intangible asset or liability created by an obligation to service assets for others. Typical servicing rights include the right to receive a fee for collecting and forwarding payments on loans and related taxes and insurance premiums held in escrow. Swaptions Contracts that grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right, but not the obligation, to enter into an interest rate swap agreement during a specified period or at a specified date in the future. Taxable equivalent interest The interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from Federal income tax. As such, these tax exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and margins for all interest earning assets, we use interest income on a taxable equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income earned on tax exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on other taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income Statement. Tier 1 common capital Tier 1 risk based capital, less preferred equity, less trust preferred capital securities, and less noncontrolling interests. Tier 1 common capital ratio Tier 1 common capital divided by period end risk weighted assets. Tier 1 risk based capital Total shareholders equity, plus trust preferred capital securities, plus certain noncontrolling interests that are held by others; less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (net of eligible deferred taxes relating to taxable and nontaxable combinations), less equity investments in nonfinancial companies less ineligible servicing assets and less net unrealized holding losses on available for sale equity securities. Net unrealized holding gains on available for sale equity securities, net unrealized holding gains (losses) on available for sale debt securities and net unrealized holding gains (losses) on cash flow hedge derivatives are excluded from total shareholders equity for Tier 1 risk based capital purposes. Tier 1 risk based capital ratio Tier 1 risk based capital divided by period end risk weighted assets. Total equity Total shareholders equity plus noncontrolling interests. Total return swap A non traditional swap where one party agrees to pay the other the total return of a defined underlying asset (e.g., a loan), usually in return for receiving a stream of LIBOR based cash flows. The total returns of the asset, including interest and any default shortfall, are passed through to the counterparty. The counterparty is therefore assuming the credit and economic risk of the underlying asset. Total risk based capital Tier 1 risk based capital plus qualifying subordinated debt and trust preferred securities, other noncontrolling interest not qualified as Tier 1, eligible gains on available for sale equity securities and the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to certain limitations. Total risk based capital ratio Total risk based capital divided by period end risk weighted assets. Transaction deposits The sum of money market and interest bearing demand deposits and demand and other noninterest bearing deposits. Troubled debt restructuring A restructuring of debt whereby the lender for economic or legal reasons related to the borrowers financial difficulties grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. Value at risk (VaR) A statistically based measure of risk which describes the amount of potential loss which may be incurred due to severe and adverse market movements. The measure is of the maximum loss which should not be exceeded on 99 out of 100 days. Watchlist A list of criticized loans, credit exposure or other assets compiled for internal monitoring purposes. We define criticized exposure for this purpose as exposure with an internal risk rating of other assets especially mentioned, substandard, doubtful or loss. Yield curve A graph showing the relationship between the yields on financial instruments or market indices of the same credit quality with different maturities. For example, a normal or positive yield curve exists when long term bonds have higher yields than short term bonds. A flat yield curve exists when yields are the same for short term and long term bonds. A steep yield curve exists when yields on long term bonds are significantly higher than on short term bonds. An inverted or negative yield curve exists when short term bonds have higher yields than long term bonds. 84 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION We make statements in this Report, and we may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook or expectations for earnings, revenues, expenses, capital levels, liquidity levels, asset quality and or other matters regarding or affecting PNC that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward looking statements are typically identified by words such as believe, plan, expect, anticipate, intend, outlook, estimate, forecast, will, project and other similar words and expressions. Forward looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. We do not assume any duty and do not undertake to update our forward looking statements. Actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those that we anticipated in our forward looking statements, and future results could differ materially from our historical performance. Our forward looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties. We provide greater detail regarding some of these factors elsewhere in this Report, including in the Risk Factors and Risk Management sections. Our forward looking statements may also be subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those discussed elsewhere in this Report or in our other filings with the SEC. Our businesses and financial results are affected by business and economic conditions, both generally and specifically in the principal markets in which we operate. In particular, our businesses and financial results may be impacted by: Changes in interest rates and valuations in the debt, equity and other financial markets. Disruptions in the liquidity and other functioning of financial markets, including such disruptions in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products. Actions by the Federal Reserve and other government agencies, including those that impact money supply and market interest rates. Changes in our customers, suppliers and other counterparties performance in general and their creditworthiness in particular. Changes in levels of unemployment. Changes in customer preferences and behavior, whether as a result of changing business and economic conditions, climate related physical changes or legislative and regulatory initiatives, or other factors. A continuation of recent turbulence in significant portions of the US and global financial markets, particularly if it worsens, could impact our performance, both directly by affecting our revenues and the value of our assets and liabilities and indirectly by affecting our counterparties and the economy generally. Our business and financial performance could be impacted as the financial industry restructures in the current environment, both by changes in the creditworthiness and performance of our counterparties and by changes in the competitive and regulatory landscape. Given current economic and financial market conditions, our forward looking financial statements are subject to the risk that these conditions will be substantially different than we are currently expecting. These statements are based on our current expectations that interest rates will remain low in the first half of 2010 but will move upward in the second half of the year and our view that the modest economic recovery that began last year will extend through 2010. Legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses or our financial condition or results of operations or our competitive position or reputation. Reputational impacts, in turn, could affect matters such as business generation and retention, our ability to attract and retain management, liquidity, and funding. These legal and regulatory developments could include: Changes resulting from legislative and regulatory responses to the current economic and financial industry environment. Other legislative and regulatory reforms, including broad based restructuring of financial industry regulation as well as changes to laws and regulations involving tax, pension, bankruptcy, consumer protection, and other aspects of the financial institution industry. Increased litigation risk from recent regulatory and other governmental developments. Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental inquiries. The results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy the requirements of agreements with governmental agencies. Changes in accounting policies and principles. Changes resulting from legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to climate change that have or may have a negative impact on our customers demand for or use of our products and services in general and their creditworthiness in particular. Changes to regulations governing bank capital, including as a result of the so called Basel 3 initiatives. 85 Our business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through the effective use of third party insurance, derivatives, and capital management techniques, and by our ability to meet evolving regulatory capital standards. The adequacy of our intellectual property protection, and the extent of any costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others, can impact our business and operating results. Our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can have an impact on our ability to respond to customer needs and to meet competitive demands. Our ability to implement our business initiatives and strategies could affect our financial performance over the next several years. Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention, as well as on our credit spreads and product pricing, which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. Our business and operating results can also be affected by widespread natural disasters, terrorist activities or international hostilities, either as a result of the impact on the economy and capital and other financial markets generally or on us or on our customers, suppliers or other counterparties specifically. Also, risks and uncertainties that could affect the results anticipated in forward looking statements or from historical performance relating to our equity interest in BlackRock, Inc. are discussed in more detail in BlackRocks filings with the SEC, including in the Risk Factors sections of BlackRocks reports. BlackRocks SEC filings are accessible on the SECs website and on or through BlackRocks website at www.blackrock.com. This material is referenced for informational purposes only and should not be deemed to constitute a part of this Report. In addition, our acquisition of National City Corporation (National City) on December 31, 2008 presents us with a number of risks and uncertainties related both to the acquisition itself and to the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC. These risks and uncertainties include the following: The anticipated benefits of the transaction, including anticipated cost savings and strategic gains, may be significantly harder or take longer to achieve than expected or may not be achieved in their entirety as a result of unexpected factors or events. Our ability to achieve anticipated results from this transaction is dependent on the state going forward of the economic and financial markets, which have been under significant stress recently. Specifically, we may incur more credit losses from National Citys loan portfolio than expected. Other issues related to achieving anticipated financial results include the possibility that deposit attrition or attrition in key client, partner and other relationships may be greater than expected. Legal proceedings or other claims made and governmental investigations currently pending against National City, as well as others that may be filed, made or commenced relating to National Citys business and activities before the acquisition, could adversely impact our financial results. Our ability to achieve anticipated results is also dependent on our ability to bring National Citys systems, operating models, and controls into conformity with ours and to do so on our planned time schedule. The integration of National Citys business and operations into PNC, which includes conversion of National Citys different systems and procedures, may take longer than anticipated or be more costly than anticipated or have unanticipated adverse results relating to National Citys or PNCs existing businesses. PNCs ability to integrate National City successfully may be adversely affected by the fact that this transaction has resulted in PNC entering several markets where PNC did not previously have any meaningful retail presence. In addition to the National City transaction, we grow our business from time to time by acquiring other financial services companies. Acquisitions in general present us with risks, in addition to those presented by the nature of the business acquired, similar to some or all of those described above relating to the National City acquisition.
