ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY KEY STRATEGIC GOALS We manage our company for the long term and focus on operating within a moderate risk profile while maintaining strong capital and liquidity positions, investing in our markets and products, and embracing our corporate responsibility to the communities where we do business. PNC operates under a moderate risk profile which has been primarily attributable to continued improvement in our credit profile as we have experienced overall positive trends in a number of key measures. Our strategy to enhance shareholder value centers on driving growth in pre tax, pre provision earnings by achieving growth in revenue from our balance sheet and diverse business mix that exceeds growth in expenses controlled through disciplined cost management. The primary drivers of revenue are the acquisition, expansion and retention of customer relationships. We strive to expand our customer base by offering convenient banking options and leading technology solutions, providing a broad range of fee based and credit products and services, focusing on customer service, and managing a significantly enhanced branding initiative. This strategy is designed to give our customers choices based on their needs. Rather than striving to optimize fee revenue in the short term, our approach is focused on effectively growing targeted market share and share of wallet. We may also grow revenue through appropriate and targeted acquisitions and, in certain businesses, by expanding into new geographical markets. We are focused on our strategies for quality growth. We remain committed to maintaining a moderate risk philosophy characterized by continued improvement in a number of key measures, disciplined credit management, and the successful execution and implementation of strategic business initiatives. We have made substantial progress in transitioning our balance sheet over the past two years, working to return to our moderate risk profile throughout our expanded franchise. Our actions have resulted in strong capital measures, created a well positioned balance sheet, and helped us to maintain strong liquidity and investment flexibility to adjust, where appropriate and permissible, to changing interest rates and market conditions. We also expect to build capital via retained earnings while having opportunities to return capital to shareholders during 2012 subject to regulatory approvals. See the Funding and Capital Sources section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section and the Liquidity Risk Management section of this Item 7 and the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 of this Report. PENDING ACQUISITION OF RBC BANK (USA) On June 19, 2011, PNC entered into a definitive agreement to acquire RBC Bank (USA), the US retail banking subsidiary of Royal Bank of Canada, with more than 400 branches in North Carolina, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Virginia and South Carolina. The transaction is expected to add approximately $18 billion of deposits and $16 billion of loans to PNCs Consolidated Balance Sheet and to close in March 2012, subject to remaining customary closing conditions. See Note 2 Acquisition and Divestiture Activity in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. FLAGSTAR BRANCH ACQUISITION Effective December 9, 2011, PNC acquired 27 branches in the northern metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia area from Flagstar Bank, FSB, a subsidiary of Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. We assumed approximately $210.5 million of deposits associated with these branches. No loans were acquired in the transaction. Our Consolidated Income Statement includes the impact of the branch activity subsequent to our December 9, 2011 acquisition. See Note 2 Acquisition and Divestiture Activity in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. BANKATLANTIC BRANCH ACQUISITION Effective June 6, 2011, PNC acquired 19 branches in the greater Tampa, Florida area from BankAtlantic, a subsidiary of BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc. We assumed approximately $324.5 million of deposits associated with these branches. No loans were acquired in the transaction. Our Consolidated Income Statement includes the impact of the branch activity subsequent to our June 6, 2011 acquisition. See Note 2 Acquisition and Divestiture Activity in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. SALE OF PNC GLOBAL INVESTMENT SERVICING On July 1, 2010, we sold PNC Global Investment Servicing Inc. (GIS), a leading provider of processing, technology and business intelligence services to asset managers, broker dealers and financial advisors worldwide, for $2.3 billion in cash. The pretax gain in discontinued operations recorded in the third quarter of 2010 related to this sale was $639 million, net of transaction costs, or $328 million after taxes. Results of operations of GIS through June 30, 2010 are presented as income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, on our Consolidated Income Statement in this Report. Once we entered into the sales agreement, GIS was no longer a reportable business segment. See Note 2 Acquisition and Divestiture Activity in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K 29 Table of Contents CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY ACTIONS Our ability to take certain capital actions, including plans to pay or increase common stock dividends or to repurchase shares under current or future programs, is subject to the results of the supervisory assessment of capital adequacy undertaken by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) and our primary bank regulators as part of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process. This capital adequacy assessment is based on a review of a comprehensive capital plan submitted to the Federal Reserve. In connection with the annual review process for 2012 (2012 CCAR), PNC filed its capital plan with the Federal Reserve on January 9, 2012. PNC expects to receive its results under the 2012 CCAR from the Federal Reserve by the end of the first quarter 2012. For additional information concerning the CCAR process and the factors the Federal Reserve takes into consideration in evaluating capital plans, see Item 1 Business Supervision and Regulation of this Report. A summary of 2011 capital and liquidity actions follows. On April 7, 2011, consistent with our capital plan submitted to the Federal Reserve earlier in 2011, our Board of Directors approved an increase to PNCs quarterly common stock dividend from $.10 per common share to $.35 per common share. That capital plan also included plans to repurchase, during the remainder of 2011, up to $500 million of common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions under our existing share repurchase program; however, we placed those plans on hold pending regulatory approval for the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition and did not repurchase any PNC common shares under the program during 2011. As noted above, 2012 capital actions, including dividends and repurchase plans, are subject to the results of the 2012 CCAR review process. The discussion of capital within the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Item 7 includes additional information regarding our common stock repurchase program. After entering into the acquisition agreement for RBC Bank (USA) in June 2011, we submitted an updated capital plan reflecting the proposed acquisition of RBC Bank (USA) to the Federal Reserve for review and approval. We announced on November 29, 2011, that PNC had been notified that the Federal Reserve had no objections to the proposed revisions to the capital actions submitted by PNC as they pertain to the acquisition of RBC Bank (USA). Accordingly, we do not plan to issue any shares of PNC common stock as part of the consideration payable to the seller at closing. On December 27, 2011 we announced that the Federal Reserve approved our acquisition of RBC Bank (USA) and that the OCC approved the merger of RBC Bank (USA) with and into PNC Bank, N.A., which is planned to occur immediately following PNCs acquisition of RBC Bank (USA). The closing of these transactions is scheduled for March 2012, subject to remaining customary closing conditions. On July 27, 2011, we issued one million depositary shares, each representing a 1/100th interest in a share of our Fixed to Floating Rate Non Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series O, in an underwritten public offering resulting in gross proceeds of $1 billion to us before commissions and expenses. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including funding for the pending RBC Bank (USA) acquisition. On September 19, 2011, PNC Funding Corp issued $1.25 billion of senior notes due September 2016. Interest is paid semi annually at a fixed rate of 2.70%. The offering resulted in gross proceeds to us before offering related expenses of $1.24 billion. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including funding for the pending RBC Bank (USA) acquisition. On November 15, 2011, we redeemed $750 million of trust preferred securities issued by National City Capital Trust II with a current distribution rate of 6.625% and an original scheduled maturity date of November 15, 2036. The redemption price was $25 per trust preferred security plus any accrued and unpaid distributions to the redemption date of November 15, 2011. The redemption resulted in a noncash charge for the unamortized discount of $198 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. RECENT MARKET AND INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTS There have been numerous legislative and regulatory developments and dramatic changes in the competitive landscape of our industry over the last several years. The United States and other governments have undertaken major reform of the regulation of the financial services industry, including engaging in new efforts to impose requirements designed to strengthen the stability of the financial system and protect consumers and investors from financial abuse. We expect to face further increased regulation of our industry as a result of current and future initiatives intended to provide economic stimulus, financial market stability and enhanced regulation of financial services companies and to enhance the liquidity and solvency of financial institutions and markets. We also expect in many cases more intense scrutiny from our bank supervisors in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels. Compliance with new regulations will increase our costs and reduce our revenue. Some new regulations may limit our ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities. The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd Frank), enacted in July 2010, mandates the most wide ranging overhaul of financial industry regulation in decades. Many parts of the law are now in effect and others are now in the implementation stage, which is likely to continue for several years. 30 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents Until such time as the regulatory agencies issue final regulations implementing all of the numerous provisions of Dodd Frank, PNC will not be able to fully assess the impact the legislation will have on its businesses. However, we believe that the expected changes will be manageable for PNC and will have a smaller impact on us than on our larger peers. Included in these recent legislative and regulatory developments are evolving regulatory capital standards for financial institutions. Dodd Frank requires the Federal Reserve Board to establish capital requirements that would, among other things, eliminate the Tier 1 treatment of trust preferred securities following a phase in period expected to begin in 2013. Evolving standards also include the so called Basel III initiatives that are part of the effort by international banking supervisors to improve the ability of the banking sector to absorb shocks in periods of financial and economic stress and changes by the federal banking agencies to reduce the use of credit ratings in the rules governing regulatory capital. The recent Basel III capital initiative, which has the support of US banking regulators, includes heightened capital requirements for major banking institutions in terms of both higher quality capital and higher regulatory capital ratios. Basel III capital standards require implementing regulations and standards by the banking regulators. Under the Basel III accord, the new Basel III capital standards will become effective under a phase in period beginning January 1, 2013 and will be in full effect January 1, 2019. A number of reform provisions are likely to significantly impact the ways in which banks and bank holding companies, including PNC, do business. We provide additional information on a number of these provisions (including new regulatory agencies (such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)), consumer protection regulation, enhanced capital requirements, limitations on investment in and sponsorship of funds, risk retention by securitization participants, new regulation of derivatives, potential applicability of state consumer protection laws, and limitations on interchange fees) and some of their potential impacts on PNC in Item 1 BusinessSupervision and Regulation and Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report. RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE MATTERS Beginning in the third quarter of 2010, mortgage foreclosure documentation practices among US financial institutions received heightened attention by regulators and the media. PNCs US market share for residential servicing is approximately 1.4% according to the National Mortgage News. The vast majority of our servicing business is on behalf of other investors, principally the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA). Similar to other banks, however, we identified issues regarding some of our foreclosure practices. Accordingly, after implementing a delay in pursuing individual foreclosures, we have been moving forward in most jurisdictions on such matters under procedures designed to address as appropriate any documentation issues. We are also proceeding with new foreclosures under enhanced procedures designed as part of this review to minimize the risk of errors related to the processing of documentation in foreclosure cases. There have been, and continue to be, numerous governmental, legislative and regulatory inquiries and investigations on this topic and other issues related to mortgage lending and servicing. These inquiries and investigations may result in significant additional actions, penalties or other remedies. For additional information, including with respect to some of the governmental, legislative and regulatory inquiries and investigations, please see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Report, and Note 22 Legal Proceedings and Note 23 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. PNCS PARTICIPATION IN SELECT GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS TARP Capital Purchase Program We redeemed the Series N (TARP) Preferred Stock on February 10, 2010. In connection with the redemption, we accelerated the accretion of the remaining issuance discount on the Series N Preferred Stock and recorded a corresponding reduction in retained earnings of $250 million in the first quarter of 2010. This resulted in a one time, noncash reduction in net income attributable to common shareholders and related basic and diluted earnings per share. See Repurchase of Outstanding TARP Preferred Stock and Sale by US Treasury of TARP Warrant in Note 18 Equity in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for additional information. FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) The FDICs TLGP is designed to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by: Guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of eligible institutions, including FDIC insured banks and thrifts, as well as certain holding companies (TLGP Debt Guarantee Program), and Providing full deposit insurance coverage for non interest bearing transaction accounts in FDIC insured institutions, regardless of the dollar amount (TLGP Transaction Account Guarantee Program). PNC did not issue any securities under the TLGP Debt Guarantee Program during 2011. In December 2008, PNC Funding Corp issued fixed and floating rate senior notes totaling $2.9 billion under the FDICs TLGP Debt Guarantee Program. In March 2009, PNC Funding Corp issued floating rate senior notes totaling $1.0 billion under this program. Each of these series of senior notes is guaranteed through maturity by the FDIC. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K 31 Table of Contents From October 14, 2008 through December 31, 2009, PNC Bank, National Association (PNC Bank, N.A.) participated in the TLGP Transaction Account Guarantee Program. Under this program, all non interest bearing transaction accounts were fully guaranteed by the FDIC for the entire amount in the account. Beginning January 1, 2010, PNC Bank, N.A. ceased participating in the FDICs TLGP Transaction Account Guarantee Program. Dodd Frank, however, extended for two years, beginning December 31, 2010, unlimited deposit insurance coverage for non interest bearing transaction accounts held at all banks. Therefore, eligible accounts at PNC Bank, N.A. are again eligible for unlimited deposit insurance, through December 31, 2012. Coverage under this extension is in addition to, and separate from, the coverage available under the FDICs general deposit insurance rules. Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) As part of its effort to stabilize the US housing market, in March 2009 the Obama Administration published detailed guidelines implementing HAMP, and authorized servicers to begin loan modifications. PNC began participating in HAMP through its then subsidiary National City Bank in May 2009 and directly through PNC Bank, N.A. in July 2009, and entered into an agreement on October 1, 2010 to participate in the Second Lien Program. HAMP was scheduled to terminate as of December 31, 2012; however, the Administration has announced that the HAMP program deadline will be extended to December 31, 2013. Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) Another part of its efforts to stabilize the US housing market is the Obama Administrations Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP), which provided a means for certain borrowers to refinance their mortgage loans. PNC began participating in HARP in May 2009. In 2011, the Obama Administration revised the program to increase borrower eligibility and extended it for another twelve months with a new termination date of December 31, 2013. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Our financial performance is substantially affected by a number of external factors outside of our control, including the following: General economic conditions, including the continuity, speed and stamina of the moderate economic recovery in general and on our customers in particular, The level of, and direction, timing and magnitude of movement in, interest rates and the shape of the interest rate yield curve, The functioning and other performance of, and availability of liquidity in, the capital and other financial markets, Loan demand, utilization of credit commitments and standby letters of credit, and asset quality, Customer demand for non loan products and services, Changes in the competitive and regulatory landscape and in counterparty creditworthiness and performance as the financial services industry restructures in the current environment, The impact of the extensive reforms enacted in the Dodd Frank legislation and other legislative, regulatory and administrative initiatives, including those outlined elsewhere in this Report, and The impact of market credit spreads on asset valuations. In addition, our success will depend, among other things, upon: Further success in the acquisition, growth and retention of customers, Continued development of the geographic markets related to our recent acquisitions, including full deployment of our product offerings, Closing the pending RBC Bank (USA) acquisition and integrating its business into PNC after closing, Revenue growth and our ability to provide innovative and valued products to our customers, Our ability to utilize technology to develop and deliver products and services to our customers, Our ability to manage and implement strategic business objectives within the changing regulatory environment, A sustained focus on expense management, Managing the non strategic assets portfolio and impaired assets, Improving our overall asset quality and continuing to meet evolving regulatory capital standards, Continuing to maintain and grow our deposit base as a low cost funding source, Prudent risk and capital management related to our efforts to maintain our desired moderate risk profile, Actions we take within the capital and other financial markets, and The impact of legal and regulatory contingencies.

SUMMARY FINANCIAL RESULTS Year ended December 31 2011 2010 Net income (millions) $ 3,071 $ 3,397 Diluted earnings per common share Continuing operations $ 5.64 $ 5.02 Discontinued operations .72 Net income $ 5.64 $ 5.74 Return from net income on: Average common shareholders equity 9.56 % 10.88 % Average assets 1.16 % 1.28 % 32 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents Our performance in 2011 included the following: Net income for 2011 of $3.1 billion was down 10% from 2010. Results for 2011 included $324 million for residential mortgage foreclosure related expenses primarily as a result of ongoing governmental matters and a noncash charge of $198 million related to the redemption of trust preferred securities. Results for 2010 included $71 million of residential mortgage related expenses, $328 million after tax gain on our sale of GIS, and integration expenses of $387 million, whereas the comparable amount of integration expenses for 2011 was $42 million. For 2010, net income attributable to common shareholders and diluted earnings per common share were impacted by a noncash reduction of $250 million related to our redemption of TARP preferred stock. Net interest income of $8.7 billion for 2011 was down 6% from 2010; net interest margin was down to 3.92% in 2011 compared with 4.14% for 2010 primarily due to the impact of lower purchase accounting accretion, a decline in average loan balances and the low interest rate environment. Noninterest income of $5.6 billion in 2011 declined 5% compared with 2010. Noninterest income for 2011 reflected higher asset management fees that were offset by lower corporate service fees primarily due to a reduction in the value of commercial mortgage servicing rights and the impact of the rules set forth in Regulation E. The fourth quarter impact of Dodd Frank on interchange revenue was offset by increased customer initiated volumes throughout 2011. The provision for credit losses declined to $1.2 billion in 2011 compared with $2.5 billion in 2010 as overall credit quality continued to improve due to slowly improving economic conditions and actions we took to reduce exposure levels during the year. Noninterest expense for 2011 increased by 6% compared with 2010, to $9.1 billion primarily due to higher residential mortgage foreclosure related expenses and a charge for the unamortized discount related to the redemption of trust preferred securities. Overall credit quality continued to improve during 2011. Nonperforming assets declined $967 million, or 19%, to $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2011 from December 31, 2010. Accruing loans past due increased $12 million, or less than 1%, during 2011 to $4.5 billion at year end primarily attributable to government insured or guaranteed loans. The allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) was $4.3 billion, or 2.73% of total loans and 122% of nonperforming loans, as of December 31, 2011. We remain committed to responsible lending to support economic growth. Total loan originations and new commitments and renewals totaled approximately $147 billion for 2011, including $4.1 billion of small business loans. Total loans were $159.0 billion at December 31, 2011, an increase of 6% from $150.6 billion at December 31, 2010. The growth in total loans exceeded the $2.4 billion decrease in Non Strategic Assets Portfolio loans driven by customer payment activity and portfolio management activities to reduce under performing assets. Consolidated growth in commercial loans of $10.5 billion, auto loans of $2.2 billion, and education loans of $.4 billion was partially offset by declines of $1.7 billion in commercial real estate loans, $1.5 billion of residential real estate loans and $1.1 billion of home equity loans compared with December 31, 2010. The $3.2 billion decrease in consolidated commercial and residential real estate loans included $1.4 billion of Non Strategic Assets Portfolio loans, accounting for approximately 43% of the consolidated decline. Total deposits were $188.0 billion at December 31, 2011 compared with $183.4 billion at the prior year end. Growth in transaction deposits (interest bearing money market, interest bearing demand and noninterest bearing) continued with an increase of $13 billion, or 10%, for the year. Retail certificates of deposit were reduced by $7.8 billion, or 21%, during 2011 and deposit costs were 51 basis points, which was 19 basis points lower than in 2010. Our higher quality balance sheet during 2011 reflected core funding with a loans to deposits ratio of 85% at year end and strong bank and holding company liquidity positions to support growth. We grew common shareholders equity by $2.8 billion during 2011. The Tier 1 common capital ratio was 10.3% at December 31, 2011, up 50 basis points from December 31, 2010. Our Consolidated Income Statement Review section of this Item 7 describes in greater detail the various items that impacted our results for 2011 and 2010. BALANCE SHEET HIGHLIGHTS Total assets were $271.2 billion at December 31, 2011 compared with $264.3 billion at December 31, 2010. The increase from year end 2010 resulted primarily from an increase in loans and other assets somewhat offset by a decrease in investment securities and short term investments. Various seasonal and other factors impact our period end balances whereas average balances are generally more indicative of underlying business trends apart from the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. The Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Item 7 provides information on changes in selected Consolidated Balance Sheet categories at December 31, 2011 compared with December 31, 2010. Total average assets were $265.3 billion for 2011 compared with $264.9 billion for 2010. Average interest earning assets were $224.3 billion for 2011, compared with $224.7 billion in 2010. Both comparisons were primarily driven by a $1.8 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K 33 Table of Contents billion decrease in average total loans partially offset by a $1.7 billion increase in average total investment securities. The overall decline in average loans reflected lower loan demand, loan repayments, dispositions and net charge offs. The increase in total investment securities reflected net investments of excess liquidity primarily in agency residential mortgage backed securities. Total loans at December 31, 2011 increased $8.4 billion to $159.0 billion compared with $150.6 billion at December 31, 2010. Average total loans decreased $1.8 billion or 1%, to $152.0 billion, in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily as loan growth during the second half of 2011 was offset by loan decreases during the first half of 2011. The decrease in average total loans primarily reflected declines in commercial real estate of $3.7 billion and residential real estate of $2.8 billion, partially offset by a $5.1 billion increase in commercial loans. Commercial real estate loans declined due to loan sales, paydowns, and charge offs. The decrease in residential real estate was impacted by portfolio management activities, paydowns and net charge offs. Commercial loans increased due to a combination of new client acquisition and improved utilization. Loans represented 68% of average interest earning assets for 2011 and for 2010. Average investment securities increased $1.7 billion, to $59.7 billion, in 2011 compared with 2010. Average securities held to maturity increased $2.3 billion, to $9.4 billion, in 2011 compared with 2010. This increase was partially offset by the decrease in average securities available for sale of $.6 billion, to $50.3 billion, in 2011 compared with 2010. The increase in average securities held to maturity was primarily a result of transfers totalling $6.3 billion from securities available for sale to securities held to maturity during the second and third quarters of 2011. Total investment securities comprised 27% of average interest earning assets for 2011 and 26% for 2010. Average noninterest earning assets totaled $41.0 billion in 2011 compared with $40.2 billion 2010. Average total deposits were $183.0 billion for 2011 compared with $181.9 billion for 2010. Average deposits remained essentially flat from the prior year period primarily as a result of decreases of $8.9 billion in average retail certificates of deposit, $.4 billion in average other time deposits, and $.4 billion in average time deposits in foreign offices, which were offset by increases of $6.6 billion in average noninterest bearing deposits, $2.5 billion in average interest bearing demand deposits and $1.2 billion in average savings deposits. Total deposits at December 31, 2011 were $188.0 billion compared with $183.4 billion at December 31, 2010 and are further discussed within the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Report. Average total deposits represented 69% of average total assets for 2011 and 2010. Average transaction deposits were $138.0 billion for 2011 compared with $128.4 billion for 2010. The continued execution of the retail deposit strategy and customer preference for liquidity contributed to the year over year increase in average balances. In addition, commercial and corporate deposit growth was very strong in 2011. Average borrowed funds were $35.7 billion for 2011 compared with $40.2 billion for 2010. Maturities of Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings drove the decline compared to 2010. Total borrowed funds at December 31, 2011 were $36.7 billion compared with $39.5 billion at December 31, 2010 and are further discussed within the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Item 7. In addition, the Liquidity Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7 includes additional information regarding our sources and uses of borrowed funds. BUSINESS SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS Highlights of results for 2011 and 2010 are included below. As a result of its sale, GIS is no longer a reportable business segment. We refer you to Item 1 of this Report under the captions Business Overview and Review of Business Segments for an overview of our business segments and to the Business Segments Review section of this Item 7 for a Results Of Businesses Summary table and further analysis of business segment results for 2011 and 2010, including presentation differences from Note 25 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. We provide a reconciliation of total business segment earnings to PNC consolidated income from continuing operations before noncontrolling interests as reported according to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) in Note 25 Segment Reporting in our Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of Item 8 of this Report. Retail Banking Retail Banking earned $31 million for 2011 compared with earnings of $144 million in 2010. Earnings declined from the prior year as lower revenues from the impact of Regulation E rules related to overdraft fees, a low interest rate environment, and the regulatory impact of lower interchange fees on debit card transactions, were partially offset by a lower provision for credit losses and higher volumes of customer initiated transactions. Retail Banking continued to maintain its focus on growing core customers, selectively investing in the business for future growth, and disciplined expense management. 34 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents Corporate & Institutional Banking Corporate & Institutional Banking earned $1.9 billion in 2011 and $1.8 billion in 2010. The increase in earnings was primarily due to an improvement in the provision for credit losses, which was a benefit in 2011, partially offset by a reduction in the value of commercial mortgage servicing rights and lower net interest income. We continued to focus on adding new clients, increasing cross sales, and remaining committed to strong expense discipline. Asset Management Group Asset Management Group earned $141 million for 2011 compared with $137 million for 2010. Assets under administration were $210 billion at December 31, 2011 and $212 billion at December 31, 2010. Earnings for 2011 reflected a benefit from the provision for credit losses and growth in noninterest income, partially offset by higher noninterest expense and lower net interest income. For 2011, the business delivered strong sales production, grew high value clients and benefitted from significant referrals from other PNC lines of business. Over time and with stabilized market conditions, the successful execution of these strategies and the accumulation of our strong sales performance are expected to create meaningful growth in assets under management and noninterest income. Residential Mortgage Banking Residential Mortgage Banking earned $87 million in 2011 compared with $269 million in 2010. The decline in earnings was driven by an increase in noninterest expense associated with increased costs for residential mortgage foreclosure related expenses, primarily as a result of ongoing governmental matters, and lower net interest income, partially offset by an increase in loan originations and higher loans sales revenue. BlackRock Our BlackRock business segment earned $361 million in 2011 and $351 million in 2010. The higher business segment earnings from BlackRock for 2011 compared with 2010 were primarily due to an increase in revenue. Non Strategic Assets Portfolio This business segment (formerly Distressed Assets Portfolio) consists primarily of acquired non strategic assets that fall outside of our core business strategy. Non Strategic Assets Portfolio had earnings of $200 million in 2011 compared with a loss of $57 million in 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to a lower provision for credit losses partially offset by lower net interest income. Other Other reported earnings of $376 million for 2011 compared with earnings of $386 million for 2010. The decrease in earnings primarily reflected the noncash charge related to the redemption of trust preferred securities in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the gain related to the sale of a portion of PNCs BlackRock shares in 2010 partially offset by lower integration costs in 2011. CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW Our Consolidated Income Statement is presented in Item 8 of this Report. Net income for 2011 was $3.1 billion compared with $3.4 billion for 2010. Results for 2011 include the impact of $324 million of residential mortgage foreclosure related expenses primarily as a result of ongoing governmental matters, a $198 million noncash charge related to redemption of trust preferred securities and $42 million for integration costs. Results for 2010 included the $328 million after tax gain on our sale of GIS, $387 million for integration costs, and $71 million of residential mortgage foreclosure related expenses. For 2010, net income attributable to common shareholders was also impacted by a noncash reduction of $250 million in connection with the redemption of TARP preferred stock. PNCs results for 2011 were driven by good performance in a challenging environment of low interest rates, slow economic growth and new regulations. NET INTEREST INCOME AND NET INTEREST MARGIN Year ended December 31 Dollars in millions 2011 2010 Net interest income $ 8,700 $ 9,230 Net interest margin 3.92 % 4.14 % Changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest earning assets and related yields, interest bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and noninterest bearing sources of funding. See the Statistical Information (Unaudited) Analysis Of Year To Year Changes In Net Interest Income and Average Consolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest Analysis in Item 8 and the discussion of purchase accounting accretion in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review in Item 7 of this Report for additional information. The decreases in net interest income and net interest margin for 2011 compared with 2010 were primarily attributable to a decrease in purchase accounting accretion on purchased impaired loans primarily due to lower excess cash recoveries. A decline in average loan balances and the low interest rate environment, partially offset by lower funding costs, also contributed to the decrease. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K 35 Table of Contents The net interest margin was 3.92% for 2011 and 4.14% for 2010. The following factors impacted the comparison: A 41 basis point decrease in the yield on interest earning assets. The yield on loans, the largest portion of our earning assets, decreased 38 basis points. These factors were partially offset by a 20 basis point decline in the rate accrued on interest bearing liabilities. The rate accrued on interest bearing deposits, the largest component, decreased 19 basis points primarily in retail certificates of deposit. We expect our 2012 net interest income, including the results of our pending RBC Bank (USA) acquisition following closing, to increase in percentage terms by mid to high single digits compared to 2011 as core net interest income should continue to grow offset by the expected decline in purchase accounting accretion, assuming the economic outlook for 2012 will be a continuation of the 2011 environment. NONINTEREST INCOME Noninterest income totaled $5.6 billion for 2011 and $5.9 billion for 2010. Noninterest income for 2011 reflected higher asset management fees and other income, higher residential mortgage banking revenue, and lower net other than temporary impairments (OTTI), that were offset by a decrease in corporate service fees primarily due to a reduction in the value of commercial mortgage servicing rights, lower service charges on deposits from the impact of Regulation E rules pertaining to overdraft fees, a decrease in net gains on sales of securities and lower consumer services fees due, in part, to a decline in interchange fees on individual debit card transactions in the fourth quarter partially offset by higher transaction volumes throughout 2011. Asset management revenue, including BlackRock, increased $34 million to $1.1 billion in 2011 compared with 2010. The increase was driven by strong sales performance by our Asset Management Group and somewhat higher equity earnings from our BlackRock investment. Discretionary assets under management at December 31, 2011 totaled $107 billion compared with $108 billion at December 31, 2010. For 2011, consumer services fees totaled $1.2 billion compared with $1.3 billion in 2010. The decrease was due to lower interchange rates on debit card transactions, lower brokerage related revenue, and lower ATM related fees, partially offset by higher volumes of customer initiated transactions including debit and credit cards. As further discussed in the Retail Banking section of the Business Segments Review portion of this Item 7, the Dodd Frank limits on interchange rates were effective October 1, 2011 and had a negative impact on revenues of approximately $75 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, and are expected to have an additional incremental reduction on 2012 annual revenue of approximately $175 million, based on 2011 transaction volumes. Corporate services revenue totaled $.9 billion in 2011 and $1.1 billion in 2010. Lower values of commercial mortgage servicing rights, largely driven by lower interest rates and higher loan prepayment rates, and lower special servicing fees drove the decline. Residential mortgage revenue totaled $713 million in 2011 and $699 million in 2010. Higher loans sales revenue drove the comparison, largely offset by lower net hedging gains on mortgage servicing rights and lower servicing fees. Service charges on deposits totaled $534 million for 2011 and $705 million for 2010. The decline resulted primarily from the impact of Regulation E rules pertaining to overdraft fees. As further discussed in the Retail Banking section of the Business Segments Review portion of this Item 7, the new Regulation E rules related to overdraft charges negatively impacted our 2011 revenue by approximately $200 million compared with 2010. Net gains on sales of securities totaled $249 million for 2011 and $426 million for 2010. The net credit component of OTTI of securities recognized in earnings was a loss of $152 million in 2011, compared with a loss of $325 million in 2010. Gains on BlackRock related transactions included a fourth quarter 2010 pretax gain of $160 million from our sale of 7.5 million BlackRock common shares as part of a BlackRock secondary common stock offering. Other noninterest income totaled $1.1 billion for 2011 compared with $.9 billion for 2010. The diversity of our revenue streams should enable us to achieve a solid performance in an environment that will continue to be affected by regulatory reform headwinds and implementation challenges. Looking to 2012, we see opportunities for growth as a result of our larger franchise and the pending acquisition, our ability to cross sell our products and services to existing clients and our progress in adding new clients. We expect noninterest income to increase in percentage terms by the mid single digits despite further regulatory impacts on debit card interchange fees, assuming the economic outlook for 2012 will be a continuation of the 2011 environment. PRODUCT REVENUE In addition to credit and deposit products for commercial customers, Corporate & Institutional Banking offers other services, including treasury management, capital markets related products and services, and commercial mortgage banking activities for customers in all business segments. A portion of the revenue and expense related to these products is reflected in Corporate & Institutional Banking and the remainder is reflected in the results of other businesses. The Other Information section in the Corporate & Institutional Banking table in the Business Segments Review section of 36 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents this Item 7 includes the consolidated revenue to PNC for these services. A discussion of the consolidated revenue from these services follows. Treasury management revenue, which includes fees as well as net interest income from customer deposit balances, totaled $1.2 billion for both 2011 and 2010. Declining deposit spreads were offset by increases in core processing products, such as lockbox and information reporting, and in growth products such as commercial card and healthcare related services. Revenue from capital markets related products and services totaled $622 million in 2011 compared with $606 million in 2010. The comparison reflects higher derivatives and foreign exchange sales and the reduced impact of counterparty credit risk on valuations of derivative positions. These increases were partially offset by lower underwriting activity. Commercial mortgage banking activities resulted in revenue of $112 million in 2011 compared with $262 million in 2010. This decline was primarily due to a reduction in the value of commercial mortgage servicing rights largely driven by lower interest rates and higher loan prepayment rates. 2010 included a higher level of ancillary commercial mortgage servicing fees and revenue from a duplicative agency servicing operation that was sold in that year. PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES The provision for credit losses declined to $1.2 billion in 2011 compared with $2.5 billion in 2010 as overall credit quality continued to improve due to improved economic conditions and actions we took to reduce exposure levels during the year. We expect our provision for credit losses in 2012 to remain stable relative to 2011 assuming the economic outlook for 2012 will be a continuation of the 2011 environment. This includes consideration of the impact of the pending RBC Bank (USA) acquisition. The Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7 includes additional information regarding factors impacting the provision for credit losses. See also Item 1A Risk Factors and the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information section of Item 7 of this Report. NONINTEREST EXPENSE Noninterest expense was $9.1 billion for 2011 and $8.6 billion for 2010. Noninterest expense for 2011 included $324 million of residential mortgage foreclosure related expenses primarily as a result of ongoing governmental matters, a noncash charge of $198 million for the unamortized discount related to redemption of trust preferred securities, and $42 million for integration costs. The comparable amounts for 2010 were $71 million, $0 and $387 million, respectively. Apart from the possible impact of legal and regulatory contingencies, charges on further trust preferred redemptions, and RBC Bank (USA) integration expenses in 2012, and excluding the fourth quarter charge for residential mortgage foreclosure related expenses of $240 million and the noncash charge of $198 million related to the trust preferred securities redemption in 2011, we expect that total noninterest expense for 2012 will increase in percentage terms by mid single digits compared to 2011. This expectation reflects flat to down expense for PNC stand alone and 10 months of RBC Bank (USA) operating expenses of approximately $600 million. In connection with the pending acquisition of RBC Bank (USA) in March 2012, we expect to incur total merger and integration costs of approximately $170 million in the first quarter of 2012. EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE The effective income tax rate was 24.5% in 2011 compared with 25.5% in 2010. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the impact of higher tax exempt income and tax credits. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

The increase in total assets at December 31, 2011 compared with December 31, 2010 was primarily due to an increase in loans and other assets, partially offset by a decrease in investment securities. An analysis of changes in selected balance sheet categories follows. LOANS Outstanding loan balances of $159.0 billion at December 31, 2011 and $150.6 billion at December 31, 2010 were net of unearned income, net deferred loan fees, unamortized discounts and premiums, and purchase discounts and premiums of $2.3 billion at December 31, 2011 and $2.7 billion at December 31, 2010, respectively. The balances do not include future accretable net interest (i.e., the difference between the undiscounted expected cash flows and the carrying value of the loan) on purchased impaired loans. Loans increased $8.4 billion as of December 31, 2011 compared with December 31, 2010. Growth in commercial loans of $10.5 billion, auto loans of $2.2 billion, and education loans of $.4 billion was partially offset by declines of $1.7 billion in commercial real estate loans, $1.5 billion of residential real estate loans and $1.1 billion of home equity loans compared with December 31, 2010. Commercial loans increased due to a combination of new client acquisition and improved utilization. Auto loans increased due to the expansion of sales force and product introduction to acquired markets, as well as overall increases in auto sales. Education loans increased due to portfolio purchases in 2011. Commercial and residential real estate along with home equity loans declined due to loan demand being outpaced by paydowns, refinancing, and charge offs. Loans represented 59% of total assets at December 31, 2011 and 57% of total assets at December 31, 2010. Commercial lending represented 56% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2011 and 53% at December 31, 2010. Consumer lending represented 44% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2011 and 47% at December 31, 2010. Commercial real estate loans represented 6% of total assets at December 31, 2011 and 7% of total assets at December 31, 2010.

Form 10 K Table of Contents Total loans above include purchased impaired loans of $6.7 billion, or 4% of total loans, at December 31, 2011, and $7.8 billion, or 5% of total loans, at December 31, 2010. We are committed to providing credit and liquidity to qualified borrowers. Total loan originations and new commitments and renewals totaled $147 billion for 2011. Our loan portfolio continued to be diversified among numerous industries and types of businesses in our principal geographic markets. Commercial lending is the largest category and is the most sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL). This estimate also considers other relevant factors such as: Industry concentrations and conditions, Recent credit quality trends, Recent loss experience in particular portfolios, Recent macro economic factors, Changes in risk selection and underwriting standards, and Timing of available information. Higher Risk Loans Our loan portfolio includes certain loans deemed to be higher risk. As of December 31, 2011, we established specific and pooled reserves on the total commercial lending category of $2.0 billion. This commercial lending reserve included what we believe to be appropriate loss coverage on the higher risk commercial loans in the total commercial portfolio. The commercial lending reserve represented 46% of the total ALLL of $4.3 billion at that date. The remaining 54% of ALLL pertained to the total consumer lending category, including loans with certain attributes that we would consider to be higher risk. We do not consider government insured or guaranteed loans to be higher risk as defaults are materially mitigated by payments of insurance or guarantee amounts for approved claims. Additional information regarding our higher risk loans is included in Note 5 Asset Quality and Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Purchase Accounting Information related to purchased impaired loans, purchase accounting accretion and accretable net interest recognized during 2011, 2010 and 2009 follows.

(b) As of December 31, 2011, we estimate that the reversal of contractual interest on purchased impaired loans will total approximately $1.4 billion. This will reduce the benefit of purchase accounting accretion and offset the total net accretable interest income of $2.1 billion on purchased impaired loans. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

The remaining purchased impaired mark at December 31, 2011 was $.8 billion, which was a decline from $1.9 billion at December 31, 2010. The associated allowance for loan losses increased slightly by $.1 billion to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2011. The net investment of $6.9 billion at December 31, 2010 declined 17% to $5.7 billion at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, our largest individual purchased impaired loan had a recorded investment of $25.2 million. We currently expect to collect total cash flows of $7.8 billion on purchased impaired loans, representing the $5.7 billion net investment at December 31, 2011 and the accretable net interest of $2.1 billion shown in the Accretable Net Interest Purchased Impaired Loans table. These represent the net future cash flows on purchased impaired loans, as contractual interest will be reversed.

The decline resulted from principal payments and net sales activity related to US Treasury and government agency and non agency residential mortgage backed securities. Investment securities represented 22% of total assets at December 31, 2011 and 24% of total assets at December 31, 2010. We evaluate our portfolio of investment securities in light of changing market conditions and other factors and, where appropriate, take steps intended to improve our overall positioning. We consider the portfolio to be well diversified and of high quality. US Treasury and government agencies, agency residential mortgage backed securities and agency commercial mortgage backed securities collectively represented 63% of the investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2011. During 2011, we transferred securities with a fair value of $6.3 billion from available for sale to held to maturity. The securities were reclassified at fair value at the time of transfer. Accumulated other comprehensive income included net pretax unrealized gains of $183 million on the securities at transfer, which are being accreted over the remaining life of the related securities as an adjustment of yield in a manner consistent with the amortization of the net premium on the same transferred securities, resulting in no impact on net income. At December 31, 2011, the securities available for sale portfolio included a net unrealized loss of $41 million, which represented the difference between fair value and amortized cost. The comparable amount at December 31, 2010 was a net unrealized loss of $861 million. The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of investment securities generally decreases when interest rates increase and vice versa. In addition, the fair value generally decreases when credit spreads widen and vice versa. The improvement in the net unrealized pretax loss compared with December 31, 2010 was primarily due to the effect of lower market interest rates. Net unrealized gains and losses in the securities available for sale portfolio are included in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss from continuing operations, net of tax. Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities do not impact liquidity or risk based capital. However, reductions in the credit ratings of these securities could have an impact on the liquidity of the securities or the determination of risk weighted assets which could reduce our regulatory capital ratios. In addition, the amount representing the credit related portion of OTTI on available for sale securities would reduce our earnings and regulatory capital ratios. The expected weighted average life of investment securities (excluding corporate stocks and other) was 3.7 years at December 31, 2011 and 4.7 years at December 31, 2010. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

Our assessment considers the security structure, recent security collateral performance metrics, external credit ratings, failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments, our judgment and expectations of future performance, and relevant independent industry research, analysis and forecasts. We also consider the severity of the impairment in our assessment. Results of the periodic assessment are reviewed by a cross functional senior management team representing Asset & Liability Management, Finance, and Market Risk Management. The senior management team considers the results of the assessments, as well as other factors, in determining whether the impairment is other than temporary. We recognize the credit portion of OTTI charges in current earnings for those debt securities where we do not intend to sell and believe we will not be required to sell the securities prior to expected recovery.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K 43 Table of Contents Residential Mortgage Backed Securities At December 31, 2011, our residential mortgage backed securities portfolio was comprised of $31.7 billion fair value of US government agency backed securities and $5.6 billion fair value of non agency (private issuer) securities. The agency securities are generally collateralized by 1 4 family, conforming, fixed rate residential mortgages. The non agency securities are also generally collateralized by 1 4 family residential mortgages. The mortgage loans underlying the non agency securities are generally non conforming (i.e., original balances in excess of the amount qualifying for agency securities) and predominately have interest rates that are fixed for a period of time, after which the rate adjusts to a floating rate based upon a contractual spread that is indexed to a market rate (i.e., a hybrid ARM), or interest rates that are fixed for the term of the loan. Substantially all of the non agency securities are senior tranches in the securitization structure and at origination had credit protection in the form of credit enhancement, over collateralization and or excess spread accounts. During 2011, we recorded OTTI credit losses of $130 million on non agency residential mortgage backed securities. Almost all of the losses were associated with securities rated below investment grade. As of December 31, 2011, the noncredit portion of OTTI losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss for non agency residential mortgage backed securities totaled $987 million and the related securities had a fair value of $3.4 billion. The fair value of sub investment grade investment securities for which we have not recorded an OTTI credit loss as of December 31, 2011 totaled $1.5 billion, with unrealized net losses of $93 million. The results of our security level assessments indicate that we will recover the entire cost basis of these securities. Note 7 Investment Securities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report provides further detail regarding our process for assessing OTTI for these securities. Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities The fair value of the non agency commercial mortgage backed securities portfolio was $6.3 billion at December 31, 2011 and consisted of fixed rate, private issuer securities collateralized by non residential properties, primarily retail properties, office buildings, and multi family housing. The agency commercial mortgage backed securities portfolio was $2.5 billion fair value at December 31, 2011 consisting of multi family housing. Substantially all of the securities are the most senior tranches in the subordination structure. There were no OTTI credit losses on commercial mortgage backed securities during 2011. Asset Backed Securities The fair value of the asset backed securities portfolio was $4.9 billion at December 31, 2011 and consisted of fixed rate and floating rate, private issuer securities collateralized primarily by various consumer credit products, including residential mortgage loans, credit cards, automobile loans, and student loans. Substantially all of the securities are senior tranches in the securitization structure and have credit protection in the form of credit enhancement, over collateralization and or excess spread accounts. We recorded OTTI credit losses of $21 million on asset backed securities during 2011. All of the securities are collateralized by first and second lien residential mortgage loans and are rated below investment grade. As of December 31, 2011, the noncredit portion of OTTI losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss for asset backed securities totaled $185 million and the related securities had a fair value of $573 million. For the sub investment grade investment securities (available for sale and held to maturity) for which we have not recorded an OTTI loss through December 31, 2011, the remaining fair value was $133 million, with unrealized net gains of $13 million. The results of our security level assessments indicate that we will recover the cost basis of these securities. Note 7 Investment Securities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report provides further detail regarding our process for assessing OTTI for these securities. If current housing and economic conditions were to worsen, and if market volatility and illiquidity were to worsen, or if market interest rates were to increase appreciably, the valuation of our investment securities portfolio could continue to be adversely affected and we could incur additional OTTI credit losses that would impact our Consolidated Income Statement. 44 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

We sold $25 million of these commercial mortgage loans held for sale carried at fair value in 2011 and sold $241 million in 2010. We recognized total net gains of $48 million in 2011 on the valuation and sale of commercial mortgage loans held for sale, net of hedges. Net losses of $18 million on the valuation and sale of commercial mortgage loans held for sale, net of hedges, were recognized in 2010. Residential mortgage loan origination volume was $11.4 billion in 2011. Substantially all such loans were originated under agency or Federal Housing Administration (FHA) standards. We sold $11.9 billion of loans and recognized related gains of $282 million during 2011. The comparable amounts for 2010 were $10.0 billion and $231 million, respectively. Interest income on loans held for sale was $193 million in 2011. Comparable amounts for 2010 were $263 million. These amounts are included in Other interest income on our Consolidated Income Statement. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $10.1 billion at December 31, 2011 and $10.8 billion at December 31, 2010. Goodwill increased $.1 billion, to $8.3 billion, at December 31, 2011 compared with the December 31, 2010 balance due to the BankAtlantic and Flagstar branch acquisitions and the correction of amounts for an acquisition affecting prior periods. The $.7 billion decline in other intangible assets from December 31, 2010 included $.2 billion and $.4 billion declines in commercial and residential mortgage servicing rights, respectively.

Total deposits increased $4.6 billion, or 2%, at December 31, 2011 compared with December 31, 2010 due to an increase in money market and demand deposits, partially offset by net redemptions of retail certificates of deposit. Interest bearing deposits represented 69% of total deposits at December 31, 2011 compared to 73% at December 31, 2010. Total borrowed funds decreased $2.8 billion since December 31, 2010. The decline from December 31, 2010 was primarily due to maturities of federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements, bank notes and senior debt, and subordinated debt partially offset by issuances of FHLB borrowings. Capital See Capital and Liquidity Actions in the Executive Summary section of this Item 7 for additional information regarding our December 2011 announcement that the Federal Reserve approved the acquisition of RBC Bank (USA) and that the OCC approved the merger of RBC Bank (USA) with and into PNC Bank, N.A. with this transaction scheduled to close in March 2012, our November 2011 redemption of trust preferred securities, our September 2011 issuance of senior notes, our July 2011 issuance of preferred stock, and our April 2011 increase to PNCs quarterly common stock dividend. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K 45 Table of Contents We manage our capital position by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing debt, equity or hybrid instruments, executing treasury stock transactions, managing dividend policies and retaining earnings. Total shareholders equity increased $3.8 billion, to $34.1 billion, at December 31, 2011 compared with December 31, 2010 as retained earnings increased $2.4 billion. The issuance of $1.0 billion of preferred stock in July 2011 contributed to the increase in capital surplus preferred stock from $.6 billion at December 31, 2010 to $1.6 billion at December 31, 2011. Accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased to a loss of $.1 billion, at December 31, 2011 compared with a loss of $.4 billion at December 31, 2010 due to net unrealized gains on securities and cash flow hedge derivatives, offset by an increase in accumulated other comprehensive losses related to the change in the funded status of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Common shares outstanding were 527 million at December 31, 2011 and 526 million at December 31, 2010. Our current common stock repurchase program permits us to purchase up to 25 million shares of PNC common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. This program will remain in effect until fully utilized or until modified, superseded or terminated. The extent and timing of share repurchases under this program will depend on a number of factors including, among others, market and general economic conditions, economic and regulatory capital considerations, alternative uses of capital, the potential impact on our credit ratings, and regulatory and contractual limitations. We did not purchase any shares in 2011 under this program. See Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this Report for further information concerning restrictions on dividends and stock repurchases, including the impact of the Federal Reserves current supervisory assessment of capital adequacy program which is also discussed in the Capital and Liquidity portion of the Executive Summary section of this Item 7.

Form 10 K Table of Contents Federal banking regulators have stated that they expect all bank holding companies to have a level and composition of Tier 1 capital well in excess of the 4% regulatory minimum, and they have required the largest US bank holding companies, including PNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient to withstand losses and allow them to meet credit needs of their customers through estimated stress scenarios. They have also stated their view that common equity should be the dominant form of Tier 1 capital. As a result, regulators are now emphasizing the Tier 1 common capital ratio in their evaluation of bank holding company capital levels, although a formal ratio for this metric is not provided for in current regulations. We seek to manage our capital consistent with these regulatory principles, and believe that our December 31, 2011 capital levels were aligned with them. Dodd Frank requires the Federal Reserve Board to establish capital requirements that would, among other things, eliminate the Tier 1 treatment of trust preferred securities following a phase in period expected to begin in 2013. Accordingly, PNC will evaluate its alternatives, including the potential for redemption on the first call date of some or all of its trust preferred securities, based on such considerations it may consider relevant, including dividend rates, the specifics of the future capital requirements, capital market conditions, replacement capital covenants with respect to certain trust preferred securities, and other factors. See Capital and Liquidity Actions in the Executive Summary section of this Item 7 for additional information regarding our November 2011 redemption of trust preferred securities and Note 13 Capital Securities of Subsidiary Trusts and Perpetual Trust Securities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on trust preferred securities. Our Tier 1 common capital ratio was 10.3% at December 31, 2011, an increase of 50 basis points compared with 9.8% at December 31, 2010. Our Tier 1 risk based capital ratio increased 50 basis points to 12.6% at December 31, 2011 from 12.1% at December 31, 2010. The Tier 1 common capital ratio increased when compared with December 31, 2010 due to the retention of earnings partially offset by higher risk weighted assets primarily from loan growth. The increase in the Tier 1 risk based capital ratio compared with December 31, 2010 resulted from the issuance of preferred stock in July 2011 and retention of earnings somewhat offset by the redemption of trust preferred securities in November 2011 and higher risk weighted assets. See Note 18 Equity in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information regarding the Series O Preferred Stock issuance. At December 31, 2011, PNC Bank, N.A., our domestic bank subsidiary, was considered well capitalized based on US regulatory capital ratio requirements under Basel I. To qualify as well capitalized, regulators currently require banks to maintain capital ratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk based, 10% for total risk based, and 5% for leverage. See the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 and Note 21 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. We believe PNC Bank, N.A., will continue to meet these requirements during 2012. The access to, and cost of, funding for new business initiatives including acquisitions, the ability to engage in expanded business activities, the ability to pay dividends, the level of deposit insurance costs, and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend, in part, on a financial institutions capital strength. We provide additional information regarding enhanced capital requirements and some of their potential impacts on PNC in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K 47 Table of Contents OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES We engage in a variety of activities that involve unconsolidated entities or that are otherwise not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet that are generally referred to as off balance sheet arrangements. Additional information on these types of activities is included in the following sections of this Report: Commitments, including contractual obligations and other commitments, included within the Risk Management section of this Item 7, Note 3 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report, Note 13 Capital Securities of Subsidiary Trusts and Perpetual Trust Securities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report, and Note 23 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. PNC consolidates variable interest entities (VIEs) when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is determined to be the party that meets both of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. A summary of VIEs, including those that we have consolidated and those in which we hold variable interests but have not consolidated into our financial statements, as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 is included in Note 3 in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Trust Preferred Securities In connection with the $950 million in principal amount of junior subordinated debentures associated with the trust preferred securities issued by PNC Capital Trusts C, D and E, as well as in connection with the obligations that remain outstanding assumed by PNC with respect to $1.7 billion in principal amount of junior subordinated debentures issued by acquired entities in association with trust preferred securities issued by various subsidiary statutory trusts, we are subject to certain restrictions, including restrictions on dividend payments. Generally, if there is (i) an event of default under the debentures, (ii) PNC elects to defer interest on the debentures, (iii) PNC exercises its right to defer payments on the related trust preferred securities issued by the statutory trusts, or (iv) there is a default under PNCs guarantee of such payment obligations, as specified in the applicable governing documents, then PNC would be subject during the period of such default or deferral to restrictions on dividends and other provisions protecting the status of the debenture holders similar to or in some ways more restrictive than those potentially imposed under the Exchange Agreements with Trust II and Trust III, as described in Note 13 Capital Securities of Subsidiary Trusts and Perpetual Trust Securities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Also, in connection with the Trust E Securities sale, we are subject to a replacement capital covenant, which is described in Note 13 Capital Securities of Subsidiary Trusts and Perpetual Trust Securities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. 48 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS In addition to the following, see Note 8 Fair Value in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for further information regarding fair value.

Form 10 K 49 Table of Contents BUSINESS SEGMENTS REVIEW We have six reportable business segments: Retail Banking Corporate & Institutional Banking Asset Management Group Residential Mortgage Banking BlackRock Non Strategic Assets Portfolio Once we entered into an agreement to sell GIS, it was no longer a reportable business segment. We sold GIS on July 1, 2010. Business segment results, including inter segment revenues, and a description of each business are included in Note 25 Segment Reporting included in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Certain amounts included in this Item 7 differ from those amounts shown in Note 25 primarily due to the presentation in this Item 7 of business net interest revenue on a taxable equivalent basis. Results of individual businesses are presented based on our management accounting practices and management structure. There is no comprehensive, authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the financial results of our individual businesses are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company. We refine our methodologies from time to time as our management accounting practices are enhanced and our businesses and management structure change. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect current methodologies and our current business and management structure. Financial results are presented, to the extent practicable, as if each business operated on a stand alone basis. Additionally, we have aggregated the results for corporate support functions within Other for financial reporting purposes. Assets receive a funding charge and liabilities and capital receive a funding credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product maturities, duration and other factors. A portion of capital is intended to cover unexpected losses and is assigned to our business segments using our risk based economic capital model, including consideration of the goodwill and other intangible assets at those business segments, as well as the diversification of risk among the business segments. We have revised certain capital allocations among our business segments, including amounts for prior periods. PNCs total capital did not change as a result of these adjustments for any periods presented. However, capital allocations to the segments were lower in the year over year comparisons primarily due to improving credit quality. We have allocated the allowances for loan and lease losses and for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit based on our assessment of risk in the business segment loan portfolios. Our allocation of the costs incurred by operations and other shared support areas not directly aligned with the businesses is primarily based on the use of services. Total business segment financial results differ from total consolidated results from continuing operations before noncontrolling interests, which itself excludes the earnings and revenue attributable to GIS through June 30, 2010 and the related third quarter 2010 after tax gain on the sale of GIS that are reflected in discontinued operations. The impact of these differences is reflected in the Other category. Other for purposes of this Business Segments Review and the Business Segment Highlights in the Executive Summary includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as gains or losses related to BlackRock transactions, integration costs, asset and liability management activities including net securities gains or losses, other than temporary impairment of investment securities and certain trading activities, exited businesses, alternative investments, including private equity, intercompany eliminations, most corporate overhead, tax adjustments that are not allocated to business segments, and differences between business segment performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP), including the presentation of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, as the segments results exclude their portion of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. 50 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

Earnings declined from the prior year as lower revenues from the impact of Regulation E rules related to overdraft fees, a low interest rate environment, and the regulatory impact of lower interchange fees on debit card transactions were partially offset by a lower provision for credit losses and higher volumes of customer initiated transactions. Retail Banking continued to maintain its focus on growing core customers, selectively investing in the business for future growth, and disciplined expense management. 52 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents Retail Bankings core strategy is to grow checking deposits as a low cost funding source and as the cornerstone product to build valuable customer relationships. The goal is to acquire and retain customers who maintain their primary checking and transaction relationships with PNC. The business is focused on deepening its share of customers financial assets, including savings and liquid deposits, investable assets and loans through sales strategies, differentiated product offerings and customer satisfaction. In this challenging economic environment, Retail Banking is also focused on expanding the use of alternative, lower cost distribution channels while continuing to optimize its traditional branch network. The business has an expansive and growing branch footprint covering nearly one third of the U.S. population in 14 states and Washington, D.C. with a network of 2,511 branches and 6,806 ATMs at December 31, 2011. Successful execution of the Retail Banking strategy in 2011 is reflected in the following: Net new checking relationships grew 296,000 in 2011, including 41,000 from the BankAtlantic and Flagstar branch acquisitions. The growth reflects strong results and gains in all of our markets. We are seeing strong customer retention in the overall network. Continued success in implementing Retail Bankings deposit strategy resulted in growth in average transaction deposits and a reduction in higher rate certificates of deposit. In 2011 average transaction deposits grew $4.3 billion, or 6%, over 2010 and average certificates of deposit declined $8.5 billion, or 21% in accordance with our business plan. In December 2011, Retail Banking added approximately $210 million in deposits, 9,000 checking relationships, 27 branches and 29 ATMs through the branch acquisition from Flagstar Bank, FSB, in the northern metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia area. In June 2011, Retail Banking added approximately $280 million in deposits, 32,000 checking relationships, 19 branches and 27 ATMs through the branch acquisition from BankAtlantic in the greater Tampa, Florida area. The planned acquisition of RBC Bank (USA) is expected to expand PNCs footprint to 17 states and Washington, D.C. and nearly 2,900 branches. The transaction is currently expected to close in March 2012 subject to remaining customary closing conditions. PNC and RBC Bank (USA) have both received regulatory approvals in relation to the respective applications filed with the regulators. Our investment in online banking capabilities continues to pay off as active online banking customers and active online bill payment customers grew by 15% and 13%, respectively, in 2011. Retail Banking launched new checking account and credit card products during the first quarter of 2011. These new products are designed to provide more choices for customers and grow value of clients for PNC. Our award winning Virtual Wallet&reg; product is providing strong momentum for customer growth. Total revenue for 2011 was $5.0 billion compared with $5.4 billion for 2010. Net interest income of $3.3 billion declined $155 million compared with 2010. The decrease over the prior period resulted from lower interest credits assigned to deposits, reflective of the rate environment, and lower average loan balances somewhat offset by higher demand deposit balances and a decrease in higher rate certificates of deposit balances. Noninterest income for 2011 declined $189 million compared to 2010. The decline was driven by lower overdraft fees resulting from the impact of Regulation E rules and lower interchange rates on debit card transactions, partially offset by higher volumes of customer initiated transactions including debit and credit cards. For 2011, Retail Banking revenue was negatively impacted by approximately $275 million compared with 2010 due to the impact of the rules set forth in Regulation E related to overdraft fees and the Dodd Frank limits related to interchange rates on debit card transactions. Regulation E, which became effective in the third quarter of 2010, had an incremental negative impact to 2011 revenues of approximately $200 million compared with 2010. The Dodd Frank limits related to interchange fees were effective October 1, 2011 and had a negative impact on revenues of approximately $75 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and are expected to have an additional incremental reduction in 2012 annual revenue of approximately $175 million, based on 2011 transaction volumes. The provision for credit losses was $.9 billion in 2011 compared with $1.1 billion in 2010. Net charge offs were $.9 billion for 2011 compared with $1.1 billion in the prior year. Improvements in credit quality are evident in the small business and credit card portfolios. We have continued to see increases in home equity delinquencies and as a result, we have worked with borrowers as employment and home values have been slow to recover in this economy. The level of provisioning will be dependent on general economic conditions, loan growth, utilization of credit commitments and asset quality. Noninterest expense in 2011 increased $47 million from 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to selective investment in key areas of the business largely offset by lower FDIC expenses. Growing core checking deposits is key to the Retail Banking strategy, and is critical to growing our overall payments business. The deposit product strategy of Retail Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing, target specific products and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K 53 Table of Contents markets for growth, and focus on the retention and growth of balances for relationship customers. In 2011, average total deposits of $122.5 billion decreased $3.1 billion, or 2%, compared with 2010. Average demand deposits increased $3.4 billion, or 9%, over 2010. The increase was primarily driven by customer growth and customer preferences for liquidity. Average money market deposits increased $877 million, or 2%, from 2010. The increase was primarily due to core money market growth as customers generally preferred more liquid deposits in a low rate environment. Average savings deposits increased $1.2 billion, or 17%, over 2010. The increase was attributable to net customer growth and new product offerings. Average consumer certificates of deposit decreased $8.5 billion or 21% from 2010. The decline is expected to continue through 2012 due to the continued run off of higher rate certificates of deposit. Currently, our primary focus is on a relationship based lending strategy that targets specific customer sectors including mass and mass affluent consumers, small businesses and auto dealerships. In 2011, average total loans were $58.3 billion, a decrease of $429 million, or 1%, over 2010. Average indirect auto loans increased $991 million, or 47%, over 2010. The increase was due to the expansion of our indirect sales force and product introduction to acquired markets, as well as overall increases in auto sales. Average education loans grew $606 million, or 7%, compared with 2010, primarily due to portfolio purchases in December 2010, July 2011, and November 2011 of approximately $450 million, $445 million, and $560 million, respectively. Average auto dealer floor plan loans grew $114 million, or 9%, compared with 2010, primarily resulting from additional dealer relationships and higher line utilization. Average credit card balances decreased $200 million, or 5%, over 2010. The decrease was primarily the result of fewer active accounts generating balances coupled with increased paydowns on existing accounts. Average commercial and commercial real estate loans declined $610 million, or 5%, compared with 2010. The decline was primarily due to refinancings, paydowns, and charge offs outpacing loan demand. Average home equity loans declined $576 million, or 2%, compared with 2010. Home equity loan demand remained soft in the current economic climate. The decline is driven by loan demand being outpaced by paydowns, refinancings, and charge offs. Retail Bankings home equity loan portfolio is relationship based, with 96% of the portfolio attributable to borrowers in our primary geographic footprint. The nonperforming assets and charge offs that we have experienced are within our expectations given current market conditions. Average indirect other and residential mortgages are primarily run off portfolios and declined $397 million and $419 million, respectively, compared with 2010. The indirect other portfolio is comprised of marine, RV, and other indirect loan products. 54 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K 55 Table of Contents Corporate & Institutional Banking earned $1.9 billion in 2011 and $1.8 billion in 2010. The increase in earnings was primarily due to an improvement in the provision for credit losses, which was a benefit in 2011, partially offset by a reduction in the value of commercial mortgage servicing rights and lower net interest income. We continued to focus on adding new clients, increasing cross sales, and remaining committed to strong expense discipline. Highlights of Corporate & Institutional Bankings performance during 2011 include the following: Overall results benefited from successful sales efforts to new clients and product penetration of the existing customer base. New primary client acquisitions in Corporate Banking of 1,165 exceeded the 1,000 new primary clients goal for the year and represented a 15% increase over 2010 new primary clients. Loan commitments increased 12% to $147 billion at year end 2011, primarily in our Business Credit, Healthcare, and Public Finance businesses. Loan balances have increased steadily each quarter during 2011, including an increase in average loans for the fourth quarter of 2011 of $8.8 billion or 14%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Our Treasury Management business, which ranks among the top providers in the country, continued to invest in markets, products and infrastructure as well as major initiatives such as healthcare. Cross sales of treasury management and capital markets products to customers in PNCs markets continued to be successful and were ahead of both targets and 2010. Midland Loan Services, one of the leading third party providers of servicing for the commercial real estate industry, received the highest U.S. servicer and special servicer ratings from Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poors for the 11th consecutive year. Midland Loan Services was the number one servicer of FNMA and FHLMC multifamily and healthcare loans and was the second leading servicer of commercial and multifamily loans by volume as of December 31, 2011 according to Mortgage Bankers Association. Mergers and Acquisitions Journal named Harris Williams & Co. Advisor of the Year in its March 2011 issue. Net interest income in 2011 was $3.4 billion, a 5% decline from 2010, reflecting lower purchase accounting accretion and lower interest credits assigned to deposits, partially offset by impacts from increases in average deposits and loans. Corporate service fees were $767 million in 2011, a decrease of $194 million from 2010, primarily due to a reduction in the value of commercial mortgage servicing rights largely driven by lower interest rates and higher loan prepayment rates, and lower special servicing fees. The major components of corporate service fees are treasury management, corporate finance fees and commercial mortgage servicing revenue. Other noninterest income was $485 million in 2011 compared with $402 million in 2010. The increase of $83 million was primarily due to valuations associated with the commercial mortgage held for sale portfolio, higher revenue from multi family agency loan production and customer driven capital markets activity. The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $124 million in 2011 compared with a provision of $303 million in 2010. The improvement reflected continued positive migration in portfolio credit quality which more than offset the impact of higher loan and commitment levels. Net charge offs in 2011 of $375 million decreased $699 million, or 65%, compared with 2010. The decline was attributable primarily to the commercial real estate and aviation portfolios. Nonperforming assets declined for the seventh consecutive quarter, and at $1.9 billion represented a 27% decrease from December 31, 2010. Noninterest expense was $1.8 billion in both 2011 and 2010. Higher compensation related costs were offset by the impact of the sale of a duplicative agency servicing operation in 2010, costs associated with aviation assets held for sale in 2010, and lower legal expenses. Average loans were $67.2 billion in 2011 compared with $64.1 billion in 2010, an increase of 5%. The Corporate Banking business provides lending, treasury management, and capital markets related products and services to mid sized corporations, government and not for profit entities, and selectively to large corporations. Average loans for this business increased $2.4 billion or 8% in 2011 compared with 2010. Loan commitments have increased since the second quarter of 2010 due to new customers and increased demand from existing customers. PNC Real Estate provides commercial real estate and real estate related lending and is one of the industrys top providers of both conventional and affordable multifamily financing. Average loans for this business declined $1.1 billion or 7% in 2011 compared to 2010 due to loan sales, paydowns and charge offs, partially offset by improved originations. PNC Business Credit is one of the top asset based lenders in the country. The loan portfolio is relatively high yielding, with moderate risk, as the loans are mainly secured by liquid assets. Average loans increased $1.9 billion or 30% in 2011 compared with 2010 due to customers seeking stable lending sources, loan usage rates, and market expansion. We expanded our operations with the acquisition of an asset based lending group in the United Kingdom, completed in November 2010. Total loans acquired were approximately $300 million. 56 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents PNC Equipment Finance is the 4th largest bank affiliated leasing company with over $9 billion in equipment finance assets. Average deposits were $50.0 billion in 2011, an increase of $6.2 billion, or 14%, compared with 2010. Deposit growth has been very strong, particularly in the second half of 2011, and is an industry wide trend as clients are holding record levels of cash and liquidity. Deposit inflows into noninterest bearing demand deposits continued as FDIC insurance has been an attraction for customers maintaining liquidity during this prolonged period of low interest rates. The repeal of Regulation Q limitations on interest bearing commercial demand deposit accounts became effective in the third quarter of 2011. As expected, interest in this product has been muted due to the current rate environment and the limited amount of FDIC insurance coverage. The commercial mortgage servicing portfolio was $267 billion at December 31, 2011 compared with $266 billion December 31, 2010. Servicing additions were mostly offset by portfolio run off.

Assets under administration were $210 billion at December 31, 2011 and $212 billion at December 31, 2010. Earnings for 2011 reflected a benefit from the provision for credit losses and growth in noninterest income, partially offset by higher noninterest expense and lower net interest income. Noninterest expense increased due to continued strategic investments in the business including front line sales staff and new client facing technology. The core growth strategies for the business include: increasing channel penetration; investing in higher growth geographies; and investing in differentiated client facing technology. For 2011, the business delivered strong sales production, grew high value clients and benefited from significant referrals from other PNC lines of business. Over time and with stabilized market conditions, the successful execution of these strategies and the accumulation of our strong sales performance are expected to create meaningful growth in assets under management and noninterest income. Highlights of Asset Management Groups performance during 2011 include the following: Positive net flows in both discretionary assets under management and total assets under administration; Strong sales production, up nearly 40% over the prior year including a 26% increase in the acquisition of new high value clients; Significant referrals from other PNC lines of business, an increase of approximately 50% over 2010; Improved credit quality and performance; Continuing levels of new business investment and focused hiring to drive growth with nearly 300 external new hires; and Roll out of PNC Wealth InsightSM, our new online client reporting tool. Assets under administration were $210 billion at December 31, 2011 compared with $212 billion at December 31, 2010. Discretionary assets under management were $107 billion at December 31, 2011 compared with $108 billion at December 31, 2010. The decrease in the comparisons was driven by the exit of pension related assets and flat equity markets on a comparative period end basis, offsetting strong sales performance and successful client retention. Total revenue for 2011 was $887 million compared with $884 million for 2010. Net interest income was $238 million for 2011 compared with $256 million for 2010. The decrease was attributable to lower loan yields, lower loan balances and lower interest credits assigned to deposits reflective of the current low rate environment. Noninterest income was $649 million for 2011, up $21 million from the prior year due to stronger average equity markets, increased sales and new client acquisition. Noninterest income in the prior year benefitted from approximately $19 million of tax, termination, integration, and litigation related items that were not repeated in 2011. Excluding these items in the comparison, total noninterest income grew 6%. Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $24 million for 2011 reflecting improved credit quality compared with provision of $20 million for 2010. Net charge offs were immaterial in 2011 as charge off activity was mitigated by significant recoveries compared with net charge offs of $42 million in 2010. Noninterest expense was $687 million in 2011, an increase of $40 million or 6% from the prior year. The increase was attributable to investments in the business to drive growth and higher compensation related costs. Asset Management Group remains focused on disciplined expense management as it invests in these strategic growth opportunities. Average deposits of $7.8 billion for 2011 increased $601 million, or 8%, over the prior year. Average transaction deposits grew 11% compared with 2010 and were partially offset by the strategic run off of higher rate certificates of deposit in the comparison.

Residential Mortgage Banking earned $87 million in 2011 compared with $269 million in 2010. The decline in earnings was driven by an increase in noninterest expense associated with increased costs for residential mortgage foreclosure related expenses, primarily as a result of ongoing governmental matters, and lower net interest income, partially offset by an increase in loan originations and higher loans sales revenue. Highlights of Residential Mortgage Bankings performance during 2011 include the following: Total loan originations were $11.4 billion for 2011 compared with $10.5 billion in 2010. Refinance volume increased compared to the 2010 period. Loans continue to be originated primarily through direct channels under FNMA, FHLMC and FHA/VA agency guidelines. Investors having purchased mortgage loans may request PNC to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans that they believe do not comply with applicable contractual loan origination covenants and representations and warranties we have made. At December 31, 2011, the liability for estimated losses on repurchase and indemnification claims for the Residential Mortgage Banking business segment was $83 million compared with $144 million at December 31, 2010. See the Recourse And Repurchase Obligations section of this Item 7 and Note 23 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Residential mortgage loans serviced for others totalled $118 billion at December 31, 2011 compared with $125 billion at December 31, 2010 as payoffs continued to outpace new direct loan origination volume. Noninterest income was $747 million in 2011 compared with $736 million in 2010. The increase resulted from higher loan sales revenue driven by higher loan origination volume, partially offset by lower net hedging gains on residential mortgage servicing rights and lower loan servicing revenue. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K 59 Table of Contents Net interest income was $201 million in 2011 compared with $256 million in 2010. The decrease in the comparison was primarily due to lower interest earned on escrow deposits. Noninterest expense was $797 million in 2011 compared with $563 million in 2010. The increase from the prior year period was primarily due to higher residential mortgage foreclosure related expenses, primarily as a result of ongoing governmental matters. The fair value of residential mortgage servicing rights was $.7 billion at December 31, 2011 compared with $1.0 billion at December 31, 2010. The decline in fair value was primarily due to lower mortgage rates which has resulted in higher prepayment rates.

PNC accounts for its BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock at fair value, which offsets the impact of marking to market the obligation to deliver these shares to BlackRock to partially fund BlackRock LTIP programs. The fair value amount of the BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock is included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet in the caption Other assets. Additional information regarding the valuation of the BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock is included in Note 8 Fair Value in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. On September 29, 2011, PNC transferred 1.3 million shares of BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock to BlackRock to satisfy a portion of our LTIP obligation. Upon transfer, Other assets and Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet were reduced by $172 million, representing the fair value of the shares transferred. Additional information regarding our BlackRock LTIP shares obligation is included in Note 15 Stock Based Compensation Plans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. At December 31, 2011, approximately 1.5 million shares of BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock were available to fund a portion of awards under future BlackRock LTIP programs. PNC accounts for its remaining investment in BlackRock under the equity method of accounting. Our voting interest in BlackRock common stock (approximately 24% at December 31, 2011) is higher than our overall share of BlackRocks equity and earnings. 60 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

(d) Recorded investment of purchased impaired loans related to acquisitions. At December 31, 2011, this segment contained 79% of PNCs purchased impaired loans. (e) For the year ended December 31. This business segment (formerly Distressed Assets Portfolio) consists primarily of acquired non strategic assets that fall outside of our core business strategy. Non Strategic Assets Portfolio had earnings of $200 million in 2011 compared with a loss of $57 million in 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to a lower provision for credit losses partially offset by lower net interest income. Highlights of Non Strategic Assets Portfolios performance during 2011 include the following: Average loans declined to $13.4 billion in 2011 compared with $16.8 billion in 2010. The expected decline was driven by customer payment activity and portfolio management activities to reduce under performing assets. Net interest income was $.9 billion in 2011 compared with $1.2 billion in 2010. The decrease reflected lower loan balances and related purchase accounting accretion. Noninterest income was $47 million in 2011 compared with a loss of $93 million in 2010. 2010 included an increase to the liability for estimated losses on repurchase and indemnification claims on brokered home equity loans sold to investors. The provision for credit losses was $366 million in 2011 compared with $976 million in 2010. The decline was driven primarily by lower losses in first mortgage and residential construction portfolios. Noninterest expense in 2011 was $275 million compared with $250 million in 2010. The increase was driven by residential mortgage foreclosure related expenses, primarily as a result of ongoing governmental matters. Nonperforming loans decreased to $.7 billion at December 31, 2011 compared with $.9 billion at December 31, 2010. The consumer lending portfolio comprised 66% of the nonperforming loans at December 31, 2011. Nonperforming consumer loans increased $20 million. Net charge offs were $370 million in 2011 and $677 million in 2010. The decrease was due to lower charge offs on residential real estate and commercial real estate loans. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K 61 Table of Contents The majority of assets within this portfolio were obtained through acquisitions and fall outside of our core business strategy. Consequently, the business activity of this segment is to manage the wind down of the portfolio assigned to it while maximizing the value and mitigating risk. The fair value marks taken upon acquisition of the assets, the team we have in place, and targeted asset resolution strategies help us to manage these assets. Additionally, our capital and liquidity positions provide us flexibility in a challenging environment to optimize returns on this portfolio for our shareholders. The $12.4 billion of loans held in this portfolio at December 31, 2011 are stated inclusive of a fair value adjustment on purchased impaired loans at acquisition. Taking the adjustment and the ALLL into account, the net carrying basis of this loan portfolio is 79% of customer outstandings. The Commercial Lending portfolio within this segment is comprised of $1.0 billion in residential development loans (i.e. condominiums, townhomes, developed and undeveloped land) and $.7 billion of performing cross border leases. This portfolio has been reduced by 33% since December 31, 2010 driven by the decline in residential development loans. The cross border lease portfolio has been relatively stable. These assets are long term and are of high credit quality. The performance of the Consumer Lending portfolio within this segment is dependent upon economic growth, unemployment rates, the housing market recovery and the interest rate environment. The portfolios credit quality performance has stabilized through actions taken by management over the last three years. Approximately 76% of customers have been current with principal and interest payments for the past 12 months. Consumer Lending consists of consumer loans, which are mainly brokered home equity loans and lines of credit, and residential real estate mortgages. The residential real estate mortgage portfolio is composed of jumbo and ALT A first lien mortgages, non prime first and second lien mortgages and, to a lesser extent, residential construction loans. Management has implemented various refinance programs, line management programs, and loss mitigation programs to mitigate risks within these portfolios while assisting borrowers to maintain homeownership when possible. When loans are sold, we may assume certain loan repurchase obligations associated with those loans primarily relating to situations where investors may request PNC to indemnify them against losses or to repurchase loans that they believe do not comply with applicable contractual loan origination covenants and representations and warranties we have made. From 2005 to 2007, home equity loans were sold with such contractual provisions. At December 31, 2011, the liability for estimated losses on repurchase and indemnification claims for the Non Strategic Assets Portfolio business segment was $47 million. No substantial additional reserves were recorded in 2011. See the Recourse And Repurchase Obligations section of this Item 7 and Note 23 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS Our consolidated financial statements are prepared by applying certain accounting policies. Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report describes the most significant accounting policies that we use. Certain of these policies require us to make estimates or economic assumptions that may vary under different assumptions or conditions and such variations may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods. Fair Value Measurements We must use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on either quoted market prices or are provided by independent third party sources, including appraisers and valuation specialists, when available. When such third party information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations. PNC applies Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820). This guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This guidance requires a three level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used in the measurement are observable or unobservable. 62 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents The following sections of this Report provide further information on this type of activity: Fair Value Measurements included within this Item 7, and Note 8 Fair Value included in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Allowances For Loan And Lease Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters Of Credit We maintain the ALLL and the Allowance for Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit at levels that we believe to be appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio and on these unfunded credit facilities as of the balance sheet date. Our determination of the allowances is based on periodic evaluations of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded credit facilities and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates, all of which may be susceptible to significant change, including, among others: Probability of default (PD), Loss given default (LGD), Exposure at date of default (EAD), Movement through delinquency stages, Amounts and timing of expected future cash flows, Value of collateral, and Qualitative factors such as changes in current economic conditions that may not be reflected in historical results. In determining the appropriateness of the ALLL, we make specific allocations to impaired loans and allocations to portfolios of commercial and consumer loans. We also allocate reserves to provide coverage for probable losses incurred in the portfolio at the balance sheet date based upon current market conditions, which may not be reflected in historical loss data. While allocations are made to specific loans and pools of loans, the total reserve is available for all credit losses. Commercial lending is the largest category of credits and is the most sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the ALLL. We have allocated approximately $2.0 billion, or 46%, of the ALLL at December 31, 2011 to the commercial lending category. Consumer lending allocations are made based on historical loss experience adjusted for recent activity. Approximately $2.3 billion, or 54%, of the ALLL at December 31, 2011 have been allocated to these consumer lending categories. To the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates, additional provision for credit losses may be required that would reduce future earnings. See the following for additional information: Allowances For Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit in the Credit Risk Management section of this Item 7 (which includes an illustration of the estimated impact on the aggregate of the ALLL and allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit assuming we increased pool reserve loss rates for certain loan categories), and Note 5 Asset Quality and Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements and Allocation Of Allowance For Loan And Lease Losses in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section of Item 8 of this Report. Estimated Cash Flows On Purchased Impaired Loans ASC 310 30 Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality (formerly SOP 03 3) provides the GAAP guidance for accounting for certain loans. These loans have experienced a deterioration of credit quality from origination to acquisition for which it is probable that the investor will be unable to collect all contractually required payments receivable, including both principal and interest. In our assessment of credit quality deterioration, we must make numerous assumptions, interpretations and judgments, using internal and third party credit quality information to determine whether it is probable that we will be able to collect all contractually required payments. This point in time assessment is inherently subjective due to the nature of the available information and judgment involved. Those loans that qualify under ASC 310 30 are recorded at fair value at acquisition, which involves estimating the expected cash flows to be received. Measurement of the fair value of the loan is based on the provisions of ASC 820. ASC 310 30 prohibits the carryover or establishment of an allowance for loan losses on the acquisition date. Subsequent to the acquisition of the loan, we are required to continue to estimate cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the loan. The measurement of expected cash flows involves assumptions and judgments as to credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, default rates, loss severity, payment speeds and collateral values. All of these factors are inherently subjective and can result in significant changes in the cash flow estimates over the life of the loan. Such changes in expected cash flows could increase future earnings volatility due to increases or decreases in the accretable yield (i.e., the difference between the undiscounted expected cash flows and the recorded investment in the loan). The accretable yield is recognized as interest income on a constant effective yield method over the life of the loan. In addition, changes in expected cash flows could result in the recognition of impairment through provision for credit losses if the decline in expected cash flows is attributable to a decline in credit quality. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K 63 Table of Contents Goodwill Goodwill arising from business acquisitions represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired. Most of our goodwill relates to value inherent in the Retail Banking and Corporate & Institutional Banking businesses. The value of this goodwill is dependent upon our ability to provide quality, cost effective services in the face of competition from other market participants on a national and, with respect to some products and services, an international basis. We also rely upon continuing investments in processing systems, the development of value added service features, and the ease of access by customers to our services. As such, the value of goodwill is supported by earnings, which is driven by transaction volume and, for certain businesses, the market value of assets under administration or for which processing services are provided. Lower earnings resulting from a lack of growth or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill, which could result in a current period charge to earnings. At least annually, in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances have changed significantly from the annual test date, management reviews the current operating environment and strategic direction of each reporting unit taking into consideration any events or changes in circumstances that may have an effect on the unit. For this review, inputs are generated and used in calculating the fair value of the reporting unit, which is compared to its carrying value. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the reporting unit is not considered impaired. However, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the reporting units goodwill would be evaluated for impairment. In this circumstance, the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill would be compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, the difference is recognized as an impairment loss. The implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill is determined by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to its assets and liabilities (including any unrecognized intangible assets) with the residual amount equal to the implied fair value of goodwill as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. The fair values of our reporting units are determined using a discounted cash flow valuation model, with assumptions based upon market comparables, and in certain instances we may also consider additional fair value market indicators. Based on the results of our analysis, there have been no impairment charges related to goodwill in 2011, 2010 or 2009. Despite the impact of challenging market conditions and Dodd Frank regulations on earnings, we believe our Retail Banking reporting unit is well positioned given expected long term growth in deposits (including the impact of continued run off of higher rate CDs), its demonstrated ability to acquire new customers while retaining existing ones, based in part upon a suite of best in class products that are continually enhanced (e.g., Virtual Wallet&reg;, Business Bankings Cash Flow OptionsSM, and credit cards), expansion into new markets with above average demographic growth attributes, cross sell opportunities for existing and new customers, a focus on retirement and investment services for the mass and mass affluent customer sectors, a scale that helps lower per unit cost for increased regulatory costs, and disciplined expense management. See Note 9 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Lease Residuals We provide financing for various types of equipment, aircraft, energy and power systems, and rolling stock and automobiles through a variety of lease arrangements. Direct financing leases are carried at the sum of lease payments and the estimated residual value of the leased property, less unearned income. Residual value insurance or guarantees by governmental entities provide support for a significant portion of the residual value. Residual values are subject to judgments as to the value of the underlying equipment that can be affected by changes in economic and market conditions and the financial viability of the residual guarantors and insurers. Residual values are derived from historical remarketing experience, secondary market contacts, and industry publications. To the extent not guaranteed or assumed by a third party, or otherwise insured against, we bear the risk of ownership of the leased assets. This includes the risk that the actual value of the leased assets at the end of the lease term will be less than the residual value, which could result in an impairment charge and reduce earnings in the future. Residual values are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. Revenue Recognition We earn net interest and noninterest income from various sources, including: Lending, Securities portfolio, Asset management, Customer deposits, Loan sales and servicing, Brokerage services, Sale of loans and securities, Certain private equity activities, and Securities and derivatives trading activities including foreign exchange. We also earn fees and commissions from issuing loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, selling various insurance products, providing treasury management services, providing merger and acquisition advisory and related services, and participating in certain capital markets transactions. Revenue earned on 64 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents interest earning assets including unearned income in the accretion of fair value adjustments on discounts recognized on acquired or purchased loans is recognized based on the constant effective yield of the financial instrument. The timing and amount of revenue that we recognize in any period is dependent on estimates, judgments, assumptions, and interpretation of contractual terms. Changes in these factors can have a significant impact on revenue recognized in any period due to changes in products, market conditions or industry norms. Residential And Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights We elect to measure our residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) at fair value. This election was made to be consistent with our risk management strategy to hedge changes in the fair value of these assets as described below. The fair value of residential MSRs is estimated by using a cash flow valuation model which calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs, and other economic factors which are determined based on current market conditions. Assumptions incorporated into the residential MSRs valuation model reflect managements best estimate of factors that a market participant would use in valuing the residential MSRs. Although sales of residential MSRs do occur, residential MSRs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices so the precise terms and conditions of sales are not available. As a benchmark for the reasonableness of its residential MSRs fair value, PNC obtains opinions of value from independent parties (brokers). These brokers provided a range (+/ 10 bps) based upon their own discounted cash flow calculations of our portfolio that reflected conditions in the secondary market, and any recently executed servicing transactions. PNC compares its internally developed residential MSRs value to the ranges of values received from the brokers. If our residential MSRs fair value falls outside of the brokers ranges, management will assess whether a valuation adjustment is warranted. For 2011 and 2010, PNCs residential MSRs value has not fallen outside of the brokers ranges. We consider our residential MSRs value to represent a reasonable estimate of fair value. Commercial MSRs are purchased or originated when loans are sold with servicing retained. Commercial MSRs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices so the precise terms and conditions of sales are not available. Commercial MSRs are initially recorded at fair value and are subsequently accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. Commercial MSRs are periodically evaluated for impairment. For purposes of impairment, the commercial mortgage servicing rights are stratified based on asset type, which characterizes the predominant risk of the underlying financial asset. The fair value of commercial MSRs is estimated by using an internal valuation model. The model calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows considering estimates of servicing revenue and costs, discount rates and prepayment speeds. PNC employs risk management strategies designed to protect the value of MSRs from changes in interest rates and related market factors. Residential MSRs values are economically hedged with securities and derivatives, including interest rate swaps, options, and forward mortgage backed and futures contracts. As interest rates change, these financial instruments are expected to have changes in fair value negatively correlated to the change in fair value of the hedged residential MSRs portfolio. The hedge relationships are actively managed in response to changing market conditions over the life of the residential MSRs assets. Commercial MSRs are economically hedged at a macro level or with specific derivatives to protect against a significant decline in interest rates. Selecting appropriate financial instruments to economically hedge residential or commercial MSRs requires significant management judgment to assess how mortgage rates and prepayment speeds could affect the future values of MSRs. Hedging results can frequently be less predictable in the short term, but over longer periods of time are expected to protect the economic value of the MSRs. The fair value of residential and commercial MSRs and significant inputs to the valuation model as of December 31, 2011 are shown in the tables below. The expected and actual rates of mortgage loan prepayments are significant factors driving the fair value. Management uses a third party model to estimate future residential loan prepayments and internal proprietary models to estimate future commercial loan prepayments. These models have been refined based on current market conditions. Future interest rates are another important factor in the valuation of MSRs. Management utilizes market implied forward interest rates to estimate the future direction of mortgage and discount rates. The forward rates utilized are derived from the current yield curve for U.S. dollar interest rate swaps and are consistent with pricing of capital markets instruments. Changes in the shape and slope of the forward curve in future periods may result in volatility in the fair value estimate.

A sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical effect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse changes in key assumptions is presented below. These sensitivities do not include the impact of the related hedging activities. Changes in fair value generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the MSRs is calculated independently without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example, changes in mortgage interest rates, which drive changes in prepayment rate estimates, could result in changes in the interest rate spread), which could either magnify or counteract the sensitivities.

In addition, filing requirements, methods of filing and the calculation of taxable income in various state and local jurisdictions are subject to differing interpretations. We evaluate and assess the relative risks and merits of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions, filing positions, filing methods and taxable income calculations after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent, and other information, and maintain tax accruals consistent with our evaluation of these relative risks and merits. The result of our evaluation and assessment is by its nature an estimate. We and our subsidiaries are routinely subject to audit and challenges from taxing authorities. In the event we resolve a challenge for an amount different than amounts previously accrued, we will account for the difference in the period in which we resolve the matter. Proposed Accounting Standards The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued several Exposure Drafts for comment during 2011 as well as the beginning of 2012. 66 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents In November 2011, the FASB issued Proposed Accounting Standards Update Consolidation (Topic 810) Principal versus Agent Analysis. This proposal would require a reporting entity to evaluate whether a decision maker is using its power as a principal or an agent. This evaluation would affect whether an entity is a variable interest entity and, if so, whether the reporting entity should consolidate the entity. The principal or agent decision would be based on the rights held by other parties, the compensation received by the decision maker and the decision makers exposure to variability of returns from any other interests that it holds in the entity. This proposal would change the evaluation of kick out and participating rights held by noncontrolling shareholders in a consolidation analysis. Additionally, the proposal would impact the requirements for determining when a general partner controls a limited partnership. Lastly, the proposal would rescind the indefinite deferral of variable interest entity analysis provided for an investment manager and other similar entities. The comment period ended February 15, 2012. We are evaluating the impact of this proposal on our financial statements. In November 2011, the FASB issued Proposed Accounting Standards Update (Revised) Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under the proposal, an entity would recognize revenue from contracts with customers when it transfers promised goods or services to the customer. The revenue recognized would be the transaction price based upon the consideration promised by the customer in exchange for the transferred goods or services. The proposal includes guidance on how to determine when a good or service is transferred over time, how to account for warranties, how to determine a transaction price (including collectability, time value of money, and variable consideration), and a practical expedient that permits an entity to recognize as an expense costs of obtaining a contract (if one year or less). The effective date has not yet been determined. The comment period ends on March 13, 2012. On January 4, 2012, the FASB issued a second proposal on Revenue Recognition that illustrates the proposed amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which were excluded from the first proposal issued in November 2011. The comment period for the second proposal also ends on March 13, 2012. We are evaluating the impact of these proposals on our financial statements. In October 2011, the FASB issued Proposed Accounting Standards Update Financial Services Investment Companies (Topic 946). This proposal would change the definition of an investment company. Additionally, it would require that an investment company consolidate another investment company in which it holds a controlling financial interest. Consistent with current U.S. GAAP, a noninvestment company parent of an investment company would continue to retain the specialized consolidation accounting. The effective date has not yet been determined. The comment period ended February 15, 2012. We are evaluating the impact of this proposal on our financial statements. In October 2011, the FASB also issued Proposed Accounting Standards Update Real Estate Investment Property Entities (Topic 973). This proposal provides accounting guidance for an entity that meets the criteria to be an investment property entity. Investment properties acquired by an investment property entity would be required to be recorded at fair value with changes in value recorded in earnings. The effective date has not yet been determined. The comment period ended February 15, 2012. We are evaluating the impact of this proposal on our financial statements. In January 2011, the FASB issued Supplementary Document Accounting for Financial Instruments and Revisions to the Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Impairment. Subsequent to this proposal, in June 2011, the FASB and IASB proposed a credit impairment model that would divide loans into three buckets for purposes of calculating impairment. The three buckets are: (1) portfolios with little to no evidence of credit impairment, (2) portfolios with observable evidence of credit impairment, and (3) individual instruments that are credit impaired. The proposed impairment calculations for the three buckets are as follows: (1) expected losses for the next 12 months for portfolios of instruments, (2) expected lifetime losses for portfolios of instruments, and (3) expected lifetime losses for individual instruments, respectively. All instruments would be initially classified in bucket 1 and transition to buckets 2 and 3 if credit performance deteriorates from origination or acquisition. This proposal continues to be discussed among the FASB and IASB. A new exposure draft is expected to be issued in the second quarter of 2012. We are evaluating the impact of this proposal on our financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report regarding the impact of new accounting pronouncements. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K 67 Table of Contents STATUS OF QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN We have a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan (plan or pension plan) covering eligible employees. Benefits are determined using a cash balance formula where earnings credits are a percentage of eligible compensation. Pension contributions are based on an actuarially determined amount necessary to fund total benefits payable to plan participants. Consistent with our investment strategy, plan assets are primarily invested in equity investments and fixed income instruments. Plan fiduciaries determine and review the plans investment policy, which is described more fully in Note 14 Employee Benefit Plans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. We calculate the expense associated with the pension plan and the assumptions and methods that we use include a policy of reflecting trust assets at their fair market value. On an annual basis, we review the actuarial assumptions related to the pension plan. The primary assumptions used to measure pension obligations and costs are the discount rate, compensation increase and expected long term return on assets. Among these, the compensation increase assumption does not significantly affect pension expense. The discount rate used to measure pension obligations is determined by comparing the expected future benefits that will be paid under the plan with yields available on high quality corporate bonds of similar duration. In lower interest rate environments, the sensitivity of pension expense to the assumed discount rate increases. The impact on pension expense of a 0.5% decrease in discount rate in the current environment is $23 million per year. In contrast, the sensitivity to the same change in discount rate in a higher interest rate environment is less significant. The expected long term return on assets assumption also has a significant effect on pension expense. The expected return on plan assets is a long term assumption established by considering historical and anticipated returns of the asset classes invested in by the pension plan and the asset allocation policy currently in place. For purposes of setting and reviewing this assumption, long term refers to the period over which the plans projected benefit obligations will be disbursed. We review this assumption at each measurement date and adjust it if warranted. Our selection process references certain historical data and the current environment, but primarily utilizes qualitative judgment regarding future return expectations. Accordingly, we generally do not change the assumption unless we modify our investment strategy or identify events that would alter our expectations of future returns. To evaluate the continued reasonableness of our assumption, we examine a variety of viewpoints and data. Various studies have shown that portfolios comprised primarily of US equity securities have historically returned approximately 10% annually over long periods of time, while US debt securities have returned approximately 6% annually over long periods. Application of these historical returns to the plans allocation ranges for equities and bonds produces a result between 7.25% and 8.75% and is one point of reference, among many other factors, that is taken into consideration. We also examine the plans actual historical returns over various periods. Recent experience is considered in our evaluation with appropriate consideration that, especially for short time periods, recent returns are not reliable indicators of future returns. While annual returns can vary significantly (rates of return for 2011, 2010, and 2009 were +.11%, +14.87%, and +20.61%, respectively), the selected assumption represents our estimated long term average prospective returns. Acknowledging the potentially wide range for this assumption, we also annually examine the assumption used by other companies with similar pension investment strategies, so that we can ascertain whether our determinations markedly differ from others. In all cases, however, this data simply informs our process, which places the greatest emphasis on our qualitative judgment of future investment returns, given the conditions existing at each annual measurement date. Taking into consideration all of these factors, the expected long term return on plan assets for determining net periodic pension cost for 2011 was 7.75%, down from 8.00% for 2010. This reduction was made after considering the views of both internal and external capital market advisors, particularly with regard to the effects of the recent economic environment on long term prospective fixed income returns. We are maintaining our expected long term return on assets at 7.75% for determining pension cost for 2012. Under current accounting rules, the difference between expected long term returns and actual returns is accumulated and amortized to pension expense over future periods. Each one percentage point difference in actual return compared with our expected return causes expense in subsequent years to increase or decrease by up to $8 million as the impact is amortized into results of operations. We currently estimate a pretax pension expense of $93 million in 2012 compared with pretax expense of $3 million in 2011. This year over year expected increase is primarily due to the amortization impact of the unfavorable 2011 investment returns as compared with the expected long term return assumption and the increase in obligations due to the drop in the discount rate. In addition, the estimate for 2012 includes approximately $2 million for employees expected to join the plan after the RBC Bank (USA) acquisition. 68 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents The table below reflects the estimated effects on pension expense of certain changes in annual assumptions, using 2012 estimated expense as a baseline. Change in Assumption (a) EstimatedIncrease to 2012PensionExpense (In millions) .5% decrease in discount rate $ 23 .5% decrease in expected long term return on assets $ 18 .5% increase in compensation rate $ 2 (a) The impact is the effect of changing the specified assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. Our pension plan contribution requirements are not particularly sensitive to actuarial assumptions. Investment performance has the most impact on contribution requirements and will drive the amount of permitted contributions in future years. Also, current law, including the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, sets limits as to both minimum and maximum contributions to the plan. We do not expect to be required by law to make any contributions to the plan during 2012. We maintain other defined benefit plans that have a less significant effect on financial results, including various nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees. RECOURSE AND REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS As discussed in Note 3 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, PNC has sold commercial mortgage and residential mortgage loans directly or indirectly in securitizations and whole loan sale transactions with continuing involvement. One form of continuing involvement includes certain recourse and loan repurchase obligations associated with the transferred assets in these transactions. Commercial Mortgage Loan Recourse Obligations We originate, close, and service certain multi family commercial mortgage loans which are sold to FNMA under FNMAs Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) program. We participated in a similar program with the FHLMC. Under these programs, we generally assume up to a one third pari passu risk of loss on unpaid principal balances through a loss share arrangement. At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the unpaid principal balance outstanding of loans sold as a participant in these programs was $13.0 billion and $13.2 billion, respectively. The potential maximum exposure under the loss share arrangements was $4.0 billion at both December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. We maintain a reserve for estimated losses based on our exposure. The reserve for losses under these programs totaled $47 million and $54 million as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, and is included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. If payment is required under these programs, we would not have a contractual interest in the collateral underlying the mortgage loans on which losses occurred, although the value of the collateral is taken into account in determining our share of such losses. Our exposure and activity associated with these recourse obligations are reported in the Corporate & Institutional Banking segment. Residential Mortgage Loan and Home Equity Repurchase Obligations While residential mortgage loans are sold on a non recourse basis, we assume certain loan repurchase obligations associated with mortgage loans we have sold to investors. These loan repurchase obligations primarily relate to situations where PNC is alleged to have breached certain origination covenants and representations and warranties made to purchasers of the loans in the respective purchase and sale agreements. Residential mortgage loans covered by these loan repurchase obligations include first and second lien mortgage loans we have sold through Agency securitizations, Non Agency securitizations, and whole loan sale transactions. As discussed in Note 3 in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, Agency securitizations consist of mortgage loans sale transactions with FNMA, FHLMC, and the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) program, while Non Agency securitizations and whole loan sale transactions consist of mortgage loans sale transactions with private investors. Our historical exposure and activity associated with Agency securitization repurchase obligations has primarily been related to transactions with FNMA and FHLMC, as indemnification and repurchase losses associated with Federal Housing Agency (FHA) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) insured and uninsured loans pooled in GNMA securitizations historically have been minimal. Repurchase obligation activity associated with residential mortgages is reported in the Residential Mortgage Banking segment. PNCs repurchase obligations also include certain brokered home equity loans/lines that were sold to a limited number of private investors in the financial services industry by National City prior to our acquisition. PNC is no longer engaged in the brokered home equity lending business, and our exposure under these loan repurchase obligations is limited to repurchases of the whole loans sold in these transactions. Repurchase activity associated with brokered home equity lines/loans are reported in the Non Strategic Assets Portfolio segment. Loan covenants and representations and warranties are established through loan sale agreements with various investors to provide assurance that PNC has sold loans to The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K 69 Table of Contents investors of sufficient investment quality. Key aspects of such covenants and representations and warranties include the loans compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the investor, including underwriting standards, delivery of all required loan documents to the investor or its designated party, sufficient collateral valuation, and the validity of the lien securing the loan. As a result of alleged breaches of these contractual obligations, investors may request PNC to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans. Indemnifications for loss or loan repurchases typically occur when, after review of the claim, we agree insufficient evidence exists to dispute the investors claim that a breach of a loan covenant and representation and warranty has occurred, such breach has not been cured, and the effect of such breach is deemed to have had a material and adverse effect on the value of the transferred loan. Depending on the sale agreement and upon proper notice from the investor, we typically respond to such indemnification and repurchase requests within 60 days, although final resolution of the claim may take a longer period of time. With the exception of the sales agreements associated with the Agency securitizations, most sale agreements do not provide for penalties or other remedies if we do not respond timely to investor indemnification or repurchase requests. Investor indemnification or repurchase claims are typically settled on an individual loan basis through make whole payments or loan repurchases; however, on occasion we may negotiate pooled settlements with investors. In connection with pooled settlements, we typically do not repurchase loans and the consummation of such transactions generally results in us no longer having indemnification and repurchase exposure with the investor in the transaction. The following table details the unpaid principal balance of our unresolved indemnification and repurchase claims at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010.

(b) Activity relates to brokered home equity loans/lines sold through whole loan sale transactions which occurred during 2005 2007. To mitigate losses associated with indemnification and repurchase claims, we have established quality assurance programs designed to ensure loans sold meet specific underwriting and origination criteria provided for in the investor sale agreements. In addition, we investigate every investor claim on a loan by loan basis to determine the existence of a legitimate claim, and that all other conditions for indemnification or repurchase have been met prior to the settlement with an investor. The table below details our indemnification and repurchase claim settlement activity during 2011 and 2010.

(g) Included in the Losses Incurred column are payments associated with pooled settlement activities. These payments were made to settle disputed pending repurchase claims as well as any future repurchase claims made by investors. No loans were repurchased in these transactions and accordingly, balances associated with these activities are not included in the Unpaid Principal Balance and Fair Value of Repurchased Loans columns in this table. 70 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents During 2011 and 2010, unresolved and settled investor indemnification and repurchase claims were primarily related to one of the following alleged breaches in representations and warranties: 1) misrepresentation of income, assets or employment; 2) property evaluation or status issues (e.g., appraisal, title, etc.); 3) underwriting guideline violations; or 4) mortgage insurance rescissions. During 2011, the volume of residential mortgage indemnification and repurchase claims increased reflecting the prolonged weak residential housing sector and the continuing industry trend of Agency investors pursuing strategies to aggressively reduce their exposure to losses on purchased loans. This increase, along with an increase in the average time to resolve investor claims, has contributed to the higher balances of unresolved claims for residential mortgages at December 31, 2011. The extended period of time to resolve these investor claims coupled with higher claim rescission rates drove the decline in residential mortgage indemnification and repurchase settlement activity in 2011. As the level of residential mortgage claims increased over the past couple of years, management focused its efforts on improving its process to review and respond to these claims. The lower balance of unresolved indemnification and repurchase claims for home equity loans/lines at December 31, 2011 was primarily attributed to pooled settlement activity and higher claim rescission rates during 2011. Management also implemented enhancements to its process of reviewing and responding to investor claims for this sold portfolio. The pooled settlement activity also drove the year over year increase in home equity indemnification and repurchase settlements. As a result, certain investor indemnification and repurchase requests received in 2010 were not resolved until the pooled settlement activity occurred in 2011. For the first and second lien mortgage balances of unresolved and settled claims contained in the tables above, a significant amount of these claims were associated with sold loans originated through correspondent lender and broker origination channels. For the home equity loans/lines sold portfolio, all unresolved and settled claims relate to loans originated through the broker origination channel. In certain instances when indemnification or repurchase claims are settled for these types of sold loans, we have recourse back to the correspondent lenders, brokers and other third parties (e.g., contract underwriting companies, closing agents, appraisers, etc.). Depending on the underlying reason for the investor claim, we determine our ability to pursue recourse with these parties and file claims with them accordingly. Our historical recourse recovery rate has been insignificant as our efforts have been impacted by the inability of such parties to reimburse us for their recourse obligations (e.g., their capital availability or whether they remain in business) or contractual limitations that limit our ability to pursue recourse with these parties (e.g., loss caps, statutes of limitations, etc.). Broker recourse activities, to the extent material, as well as the trends in unresolved claim and indemnification and repurchase activity described above are considered in the determination of our estimated indemnification and repurchase liability detailed below. Origination and sale of residential mortgages is an ongoing business activity and, accordingly, management continually assesses the need to recognize indemnification and repurchase liabilities pursuant to the associated investor sale agreements. We establish indemnification and repurchase liabilities for estimated losses on sold first and second lien mortgages and home equity loans/lines for which indemnification is expected to be provided or for loans that are expected to be repurchased. For the first and second lien mortgage sold portfolio, we have established an indemnification and repurchase liability pursuant to investor sale agreements based on claims made and our estimate of future claims on a loan by loan basis. These relate primarily to loans originated during 2006 2008. For the home equity loans/lines sold portfolio, we have established indemnification and repurchase liabilities based upon this same methodology for loans sold during 2005 2007. Indemnification and repurchase liabilities, which are included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, are initially recognized when loans are sold to investors and are subsequently evaluated by management. Initial recognition and subsequent adjustments to the indemnification and repurchase liability for the sold residential mortgage portfolio are recognized in Residential mortgage revenue on the Consolidated Income Statement. Since PNC is no longer engaged in the brokered home equity lending business, only subsequent adjustments are recognized to the home equity loans/lines indemnification and repurchase liability. These adjustments are recognized in Other noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement. Managements subsequent evaluation of these indemnification and repurchase liabilities is based upon trends in indemnification and repurchase requests, actual loss experience, risks in the underlying serviced loan portfolios, and current economic conditions. As part of its evaluation, management considers estimated loss projections over the life of the subject loan portfolio. We believe our indemnification and repurchase liabilities appropriately reflect the estimated probable losses on investor indemnification and repurchase claims at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the liability for estimated losses on indemnification and repurchase claims for residential mortgages totaled $83 million and $144 million, respectively. The year over year decline in this liability reflects lower estimated losses driven primarily by the seasoning of the sold portfolio and higher claim rescission rates as described above. This decrease resulted despite higher levels of investor indemnification and repurchase claim activity. The indemnification and repurchase liability for home equity loans/lines was $47 million and $150 million at The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K 71 Table of Contents December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. The year over year reduction in this liability was reflective of lower anticipated indemnification and repurchase activity for the sold portfolio due to pooled settlement activities, improved investor rescission rates as described above, and the seasoning of the sold home equity portfolio. RISK MANAGEMENT We encounter risk as part of the normal course of operating our business and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks. This Risk Management section describes our risk management philosophy, principles, governance and various aspects of our corporate level risk management program. We also provide an analysis of our primary areas of risk: credit, operational, model, liquidity, and market. The discussion of market risk is further subdivided into interest rate, trading, and equity and other investment risk areas. Our use of financial derivatives as part of our overall asset and liability risk management process is also addressed within the Risk Management section of this Item 7. In appropriate places within this section, historical performance is also addressed. Risk Management Philosophy and Profile We fundamentally believe that risk management is a critical activity in successfully operating our business. We have adopted and implemented a risk philosophy with a goal of managing to an overall moderate level of risk to capture opportunities and optimize shareholder value. We actively support a risk management culture which promotes communication, teamwork, and our governance structure to help us manage our risks in the best interest of our business and shareholders. We dynamically set our strategies and make distinct risk taking decisions with consideration for the impact to our aggregate risk position. During 2011, our corporate risk profile returned to an overall moderate level due to continued improvement in a number of key measures, disciplined credit management, and the successful execution and implementation of strategic business initiatives. Risk Management Principles In managing the risks we encounter, we employ the following accepted guiding principles to establish boundaries for the risks which we are willing to accept in the course of doing business. These include being able to effectively: Identify and Understand Risks and Returns Make Balanced Risk Decisions Monitor and Manage Risks Risk Management Governance We employ a comprehensive Risk Management governance structure to help ensure that risks are identified; balanced decisions are made that consider risk and return; and risks are adequately monitored and managed. Risk committees established within this governance structure provide oversight for risk management activities at the Board, Corporate, and Business level. We utilize our governance structure to assess the effectiveness of our Risk Management practices on an ongoing basis, based on how we manage our day to day business activities and on our development and execution of more specific strategies to mitigate risks. Our businesses strive to enhance risk management and internal control processes in light of heightened regulatory expectations focused on large financial institutions. We have integrated and comprehensive processes in place that are designed to adequately identify, measure, manage, monitor, and report risks which may significantly impact our business. The roles and responsibilities for our Risk Management activities rest with the following groups: Line of Business Management and corporate support functions have the responsibility for identifying and managing risks generated in day to day business activities. This includes performing quality assurance testing on processes to identify risks and implementing necessary mitigation measures; setting control level policies and procedures designed to manage program execution within boundaries defined by risk management; and supporting risk reporting activities and escalation of key risks. Risk Management supports business management in meeting their responsibilities for managing risk in a partnership role by proactively assessing risk, as well as an oversight role of measuring, monitoring, and challenging firm wide risk management capabilities. This includes establishing enterprise level risk management policies that govern the control level policies, performing quality control on process outcomes, establishing appropriate governance and challenge functions via the risk committees, and creating risk transparency through ownership of risk reporting activities. Internal Audit develops a risk based audit program to help provide assurance on the management of risk throughout the organization. This includes auditing business processes across the organization and reporting on the effectiveness of controls, as well as auditing the risk management policy and infrastructure implemented by the enterprise risk management function. Corporate Level Risk Management Program The corporate risk management organization has the following key roles: Facilitate the identification, assessment and monitoring of risk across PNC, Provide support and oversight to the businesses, Help identify and implement risk management best practices, as appropriate, and Work with the lines of business to shape and define PNCs business risk limits. Risk Measurement We conduct risk measurement activities specific to each area of risk utilizing a variety of methodologies. The primary vehicle for aggregation of enterprise wide risk is a comprehensive risk management methodology which focuses on maximizing economic capital. This primary risk 72 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents aggregation measure is supplemented with secondary measures of risk to arrive at an estimate of corporate wide risk. The economic capital framework is a measure of potential losses above and beyond expected losses. Our capital management practices incorporate risks associated with potential credit losses (Credit Risk); fluctuations of the estimated market value of financial instruments (Market Risk); failure of people, processes or systems (Operational Risk); calculations, assumptions, and validation of internal measurements (Model Risk); and losses associated with declining margins and or fees, and the fixed cost structure of the business. We estimate credit and market risks at pool and exposure levels while we estimate the remaining risk types at an institution or business segment level. Risk Management Strategies Risk management is not about eliminating risks, but about identifying and accepting risks and then working to effectively manage them so as to optimize all aspects of shareholder value. We centrally manage policy development, exception approval, and oversight through our corporate level risk management structure. Some of these policies express our risk appetite through limits to the acceptable level of risk. If we are in excess of certain limits, we implement strategies designed to progressively manage our risks to be within acceptable tolerances. We also review and revise certain policies to better reflect specific business requirements of our changing organization. This risk management structure also affords us opportunities to take action in either preventing or mitigating unapproved exceptions to policies. PNCs Internal Audit function also performs its own assessment of our internal control environment. Internal Audit plays a critical role in risk management, testing the operation of the internal control system and reporting findings to management and to the Audit Committee of the Board. Risk Monitoring and Reporting Monitoring and evaluation of controls help to provide assurance that controls are effective, and can also result in the identification of opportunities to improve risk controls. Our risk reporting provides an overall risk aggregation and transparent communication of these aggregated risks. Risk reports are produced at the line of business level, the functional level (credit, market, operational), and at the corporate level. Our enterprise risk profile is a point in time assessment of corporate wide risk. The risk profile represents PNCs overall risk position in relation to the desired corporate risk appetite. The determination of the risk profiles position is based on comprehensive and subjective analysis of reported risk limits, metrics, operating guidelines, and qualitative assessments. CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT Credit risk represents the possibility that a customer, counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. Credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into financial derivative transactions and certain guarantee contracts. Credit risk is one of our most significant risks. Our processes for managing credit risk are embedded in PNCs risk culture and in our decision making processes using a systematic approach whereby credit risks and related exposures are: identified and assessed; managed through specific policies and processes; measured and evaluated against our risk tolerance limits; and reported, along with specific mitigation activities, to management and the board through our governance structure. Asset Quality Overview Overall asset quality trends for 2011 were positive and included the following: Overall loan delinquencies, excluding government insured or guaranteed loans, have declined from year end 2010 levels helped by the slowly improving economy. Aided by a continued, albeit slowly, improving economy, nonperforming loans declined $906 million, or 20%, to $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2011 compared with December 31, 2010. Similarly, nonperforming assets decreased $967 million, or 19%, to $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2011, compared with December 31, 2010. Commercial credit quality trends improved noticeably with levels of criticized commercial loan outstandings declining by approximately $3.8 billion, or 28% compared with December 31, 2010, to $9.9 billion at December 31, 2011. See Note 5 Asset Quality and Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Net charge offs declined significantly to $1.6 billion, down 44% from 2010 net charge offs of $2.9 billion. Reflecting improvements in asset quality, the provision for credit losses declined to $1.2 billion for 2011 compared with $2.5 billion for 2010. The level of ALLL has decreased to $4.3 billion at December 31, 2011 from $4.9 billion at December 31, 2010. These positive trends were partially offset by our ongoing loan modification efforts to assist homeowners and other borrowers. These efforts continued to increase our overall level of troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). In particular, TDRs included in nonperforming loans increased to 32% of total nonperforming loans. However, as the economy has slowly improved, the amount of TDRs returning to performing status has increased. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K 73 Table of Contents NONPERFORMING ASSETS AND LOAN DELINQUENCIES Nonperforming Assets, including OREO and Foreclosed Assets Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of contractual principal and interest is not probable and include TDRs, OREO and foreclosed assets. Loans held for sale, government insured or guaranteed loans, purchased impaired loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option are excluded from nonperforming loans. Additional information regarding our nonaccrual policies is included in Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. A summary of nonperforming assets is presented in the table below. Nonperforming assets decreased $967 million from December 31, 2010, to $4.2 billion at December 31, 2011. Nonperforming loans decreased $906 million to $3.6 billion while OREO and foreclosed assets decreased $61 million to $596 million. The ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans and OREO and foreclosed assets was 2.60% at December 31, 2011 and 3.39% at December 31, 2010. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans declined to 2.24% at December 31, 2011, compared to 2.97% at December 31, 2010. The decrease in nonperforming loans from December 31, 2010 occurred across all loan classes except for home equity and credit card. Home equity nonperforming loans continued to increase as a result of the extended period of time to exit problem loans from the portfolio and the additions of modifications which result in TDRs. Total nonperforming assets have declined $2.3 billion, or 35%, from their peak of $6.4 billion at March 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, TDRs included in nonperforming loans increased to $1.1 billion or 32% of total nonperforming loans compared to $784 million or 18% of nonperforming loans as of December 31, 2010. Within consumer nonperforming loans, residential real estate TDRs comprise 51% of total residential real estate nonperforming loans at December 31, 2011, up from 30% at December 31, 2010. Similarly, home equity TDRs comprise 77% of home equity nonperforming loans at December 31, 2011, up slightly from 75% at December 31, 2010. The level of TDRs in these portfolios is expected to result in elevated nonperforming loan levels for longer periods because TDRs remain in nonperforming status until a borrower has made at least six consecutive months of payments under the modified terms or ultimate resolution occurs. At December 31, 2011, our largest nonperforming asset was $28 million in the Accommodation and Food Services Industry and our average nonperforming loan associated with commercial lending was under $1 million. Our ten largest outstanding nonperforming assets are all from the commercial lending portfolio and represent 9% and 5% of total commercial lending nonperforming loans and total nonperforming assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2011.

(b) Excludes most consumer loans and lines of credit, not secured by residential real estate, which are charged off after 120 to 180 days past due and are not placed on nonperforming status. (c) Effective in 2011, nonperforming residential mortgage excludes loans of $61 million accounted for under the fair value option as of December 31, 2011. The comparable balance at December 31, 2010 was not material. 74 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents (d) Effective in the second quarter 2011, the commercial nonaccrual policy was applied to certain small business credit card balances. This change resulted in loans being placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days or more past due. We continue to charge off these loans at 180 days past due. (e) Nonperforming loans do not include government insured or guaranteed loans, loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option and purchased impaired loans. (f) Other real estate owned excludes $280 million and $178 million at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, related to residential real estate that was acquired by us upon foreclosure of serviced loans because they are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). (g) The allowance for loan and lease losses includes impairment reserves attributable to purchased impaired loans.

OREO and Foreclosed Assets In millions Dec. 312011 Dec. 312010 Other real estate owned (OREO): Residential properties $ 191 $ 304 Residential development properties 183 166 Commercial properties 187 119 Total OREO 561 589 Foreclosed and other assets 35 68 OREO and foreclosed assets $ 596 $ 657 Total OREO and foreclosed assets decreased $61 million during 2011 from $657 million at December 31, 2010, to $596 million at December 31, 2011, which represents 14% of total nonperforming assets. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, 32% and 46%, respectively, of our OREO and foreclosed assets were comprised of single family residential properties. The lower level of OREO and foreclosed assets was driven by lower levels of residential properties as new foreclosures have fallen from the very high levels of early 2010 and sales of foreclosed properties have rebounded from the low point in the fourth quarter 2010, partially offset by an increase in commercial properties which was due to an increase in the average balance added to OREO with commercial property sales remaining constant year over year. Excluded from OREO at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, was $280 million and $178 million of residential real estate that was acquired by us upon foreclosure of serviced loans because they are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Change in Nonperforming Assets In millions 2011 2010 January 1 $ 5,123 $ 6,204 New nonperforming assets 3,625 5,213 Charge offs and valuation adjustments (1,220 ) (2,071 ) Principal activity, including paydowns and payoffs (1,960 ) (1,316 ) Asset sales and transfers to loans held for sale (613 ) (1,446 ) Returned to performing status (799 ) (1,461 ) December 31 $ 4,156 $ 5,123 The table above presents nonperforming asset activity for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. Nonperforming assets decreased $967 million from $5.1 billion at December 31, 2010, to $4.2 billion at December 31, 2011. Approximately 80% of total nonperforming loans are secured by collateral, which would be expected to reduce credit losses and require less reserves in the event of default, and 28% of commercial lending nonperforming loans are contractually current as to principal and interest. As of December 31, 2011, commercial nonperforming loans are carried at approximately 62% of their unpaid principal balance, due to charge offs recorded to date, before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Purchased impaired loans are considered performing, even if contractually past due (or if we do not expect to receive payment in full based on the original contractual terms), as we are currently accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans. The accretable yield represents the excess of the expected cash flows on the loans at the measurement date over the carrying value. Generally decreases, other than interest rate decreases for variable rate notes, in the net present value of expected cash flows of individual commercial or pooled consumer purchased impaired loans would result in an impairment charge to the provision for loan losses in the period in which the change is deemed probable. Generally increases in the net present value of expected cash flows of purchased impaired loans would first result in a recovery of previously recorded allowance for loan losses, to the extent applicable, and then an increase to accretable yield for the remaining life of the purchased impaired loans. Total nonperforming loans and assets in the tables above are significantly lower than they would have been due to this accounting treatment for purchased impaired loans. This treatment also results in a lower ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans and a higher ratio of ALLL to nonperforming loans. See Note 6 Purchased Impaired Loans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on these loans. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K 75 Table of Contents Loan Delinquencies We regularly monitor the level of loan delinquencies and believe these levels may be a key indicator of loan portfolio asset quality. Measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of payment are considered delinquent. Loan delinquencies exclude loans held for sale and purchased impaired loans, but include government insured or guaranteed loans. Total early stage loan delinquencies (accruing loans past due 30 to 89 days) decreased by $252 million from December 31, 2010, to $1.6 billion at December 31, 2011. Commercial lending early stage delinquencies declined by $245 million from December 31, 2010, while consumer lending delinquencies fell by $7 million. Improvement in early stage delinquency levels was experienced across most loan classes, offset by modest increases in government insured, primarily other consumer education loans, and home equity. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more are referred to as late stage delinquencies. These loans are not included in nonperforming loans and continue to accrue interest because they are well secured by collateral, are in the process of collection and are reasonably expected to result in repayment or restoration to current status, or are managed in homogenous portfolios with specified charge off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines. These loans increased 10% from $2.7 billion at December 31, 2010, to $3.0 billion at December 31, 2011, reflecting higher government insured delinquent residential real estate and other consumer loans, primarily education loans, and higher delinquent home equity loans, partially offset by improvement in commercial lending delinquency levels, primarily commercial real estate. The following tables display the delinquency status of our accruing loans past due at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. Additional information regarding accruing loans past due is included in Note 5 Asset Quality and Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

These loans totaled $438 million at December 31, 2011 and $574 million at December 31, 2010. Home Equity Loan Portfolio Our home equity loan portfolio totaled $33.1 billion as of December 31, 2011, or 21% of the total loan portfolio. Of that total, $22.5 billion, or 68%, was outstanding under primarily variable rate home equity lines of credit and $10.6 billion, or 32%, consisted of closed end home equity installment loans. Less than 2% of the home equity portfolio was on nonperforming status as of December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, we are in an originated first lien position for approximately 33% of the total portfolio and, where originated as a second lien, we currently hold or service the first lien position for approximately an additional 2% of the portfolio. Historically, we have originated and sold first mortgages which has resulted in a low percentage of home equity loans where we hold the first lien mortgage position. The remaining 65% of the portfolio was secured by second liens where we do not hold the first lien position. For the majority of the home equity portfolio where we are in, hold or service the first lien position, the credit performance of this portion of the portfolio is superior to the portion of the portfolio where we hold the second lien position but do not hold the first lien. Subsequent to origination, PNC is not typically notified when a senior lien position that is not held by PNC is satisfied. Therefore, information about the current lien status of the loans is limited, for loans that were originated in subordinated lien positions where PNC does not also hold the senior lien, to what can be obtained from external sources. PNC contracted with a third party service provider to provide updated loan, lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources. We started receiving the data in late 2011 and we are working with the third party provider to enhance the information we are receiving. As we have made progress in our efforts, we have incrementally enhanced our risk management processes and reporting to incorporate this updated loan, lien, and collateral data, and we anticipate being substantially complete by the end of second quarter 2012. We track borrower performance monthly and other credit metrics at least quarterly, including historical performance of any mortgage loans regardless of lien position that we may or may not hold, updated FICO scores and original and updated LTVs. This information is used for internal risk management reporting and monitoring. We segment the population into pools based on product type (e.g., home equity loans, brokered home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, brokered home equity lines of credit). We also further segment certain loans based upon the delinquency status of any mortgage loan with the same borrower (regardless of whether it is a first lien senior to our second lien). In establishing our ALLL, we utilize a delinquency roll rate methodology for pools of loans. In accordance with accounting principles, under this methodology, we establish our allowance based upon incurred losses and not lifetime expected losses. The roll rate methodology estimates transition/roll of loan balances from one delinquency state (e.g., 30 59 days past due) to another delinquency state (e.g., 60 89 days past due) and ultimately charge off. The roll through to charge off is based on PNCs actual loss experience for each type of pool. Since a pool may consist of first and second liens, the charge off amounts for the pool are proportionate to the composition of first and second liens in the pool. Our experience has been that the ratio of first to second lien loans has been consistent over time and is appropriately represented in our pools used for roll rate calculations. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K 77 Table of Contents Generally, our variable rate home equity lines of credit have either a seven or ten year draw period, followed by a 20 year amortization term. During the draw period, we have home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay interest only and home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay principal and interest. Based upon outstanding balances at December 31, 2011, the following table presents the periods when home equity lines of credit draw periods are scheduled to end. Home Equity Lines of Credit Draw Period End Dates In millions Interest OnlyProduct Principal andInterest Product 2012 $ 904 $ 266 2013 1,211 331 2014 2,043 598 2015 1,988 820 2016 and thereafter 6,961 5,601 Total (a) $ 13,107 $ 7,616 (a) Includes approximately $306 million, $44 million, $60 million, $100 million, and $246 million of home equity lines of credit with balloon payments with draw periods scheduled to end in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 and thereafter, respectively. We view home equity lines of credit where borrowers are paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those where the borrowers are paying interest only, as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments. Based upon outstanding balances, and excluding purchased impaired loans, at December 31, 2011, for home equity lines of credit for which the borrower can no longer draw (e.g., draw period has ended or borrowing privileges have been terminated), approximately 4.32% were 30 89 days past due and approximately 5.57% were greater than or equal to 90 days past due. Generally, when a borrower becomes 60 days past due, we terminate borrowing privileges, and those privileges are not subsequently reinstated. At that point, we continue our collection/recovery processes, which may include a loss mitigation loan modification resulting in a loan that is classified as a TDR. See Note 5 Asset Quality and Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. LOAN MODIFICATIONS AND TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS Consumer Loan Modifications We modify loans under government and PNC developed programs based upon our commitment to help eligible homeowners and borrowers avoid foreclosure, where appropriate. Initially, a borrower is evaluated for a modification under a government program. If a borrower does not qualify under a government program, the borrower is then evaluated under a PNC program. Our programs utilize both temporary and permanent modifications and typically reduce the interest rate, extend the term and or defer principal. Temporary and permanent modifications under programs involving a change to loan terms are generally classified as TDRs. Further, certain payment plans and trial payment arrangements which do not include a contractual change to loan terms may be classified as TDRs. Additional detail on TDRs is discussed below as well as in Note 5 Asset Quality and Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. A temporary modification, with a term between three and 60 months, involves a change in original loan terms for a period of time and reverts to the original loan terms as of a specific date or the occurrence of an event, such as a failure to pay in accordance with the terms of the modification. Typically, these modifications are for a period of up to 24 months after which the interest rate reverts to the original loan rate. A permanent modification, with a term greater than 60 months, is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed. Permanent modifications primarily include the government created Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) or PNC developed HAMP like modification programs. For consumer loan programs, such as residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines, we will enter into a temporary modification when the borrower has indicated a temporary hardship and a willingness to bring current the delinquent loan balance. Examples of this situation often include delinquency due to illness or death in the family, or a loss of employment. Permanent modifications are entered into when it is confirmed that the borrower does not possess the income necessary to continue making loan payments at the current amount, but our expectation is that payments at lower amounts can be made. Residential mortgage and home equity loans and lines have been modified with changes in terms for up to 60 months, although the majority involve periods of three to 24 months. We also monitor the success rates and delinquency status of our loan modification programs to assess their effectiveness in serving our customers needs while mitigating credit losses. The following tables provide the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified consumer real estate related loans as well as the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified loans that were 60 days or more past due as of six months, nine months and twelve months after the modification date. 78 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

The data in this table represents loan modifications completed during the quarter ending June 30, 2010 through June 30, 2011 and represents a vintage look at all quarterly accounts and the number of those modified accounts (for each quarterly vintage) 60 days or more delinquent at six, nine, and twelve months after modification. Account totals include active and inactive accounts that were delinquent when they achieved inactive status. (b) Vintage refers to the quarter in which the modification occurred. (c) Reflects December 31, 2011 unpaid principal balances of the re defaulted accounts for the Second Quarter 2011 Vintage at Six Months, for the First Quarter 2011 Vintage at Nine Months, and for Fourth Quarter 2010 and prior Vintages at Twelve Months. (d) The unpaid principal balance for permanent home equity modifications totals less than $1 million for each vintage. In addition to temporary loan modifications, we may make available to a borrower a payment plan or a HAMP trial payment period. Under a payment plan or a HAMP trial payment period, there is no change to the loans contractual terms so the borrower remains legally responsible for payment of the loan under its original terms. A payment plan involves the borrower making payments that differ from the contractual payment amount for a short period of time, generally three months, during which time a borrower is brought current. Our motivation is to allow for repayment of an outstanding past due amount through payment of additional amounts over the short period of time. Due to the short term nature of the payment plan there is a minimal impact to the ALLL. Under a HAMP trial payment period, we allow a borrower to demonstrate successful payment performance before establishing an alternative payment amount. Subsequent to successful borrower performance under the trial payment period, we will change a loans contractual terms. As the borrower is often already delinquent at the time of participation in the HAMP trial payment period, upon successful completion, there is not a significant increase in the ALLL. If the trial payment period is unsuccessful, the loan will be charged off at the end of the trial payment period to its estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. Residential conforming and certain residential construction loans have been permanently modified under HAMP or, if they do not qualify for a HAMP modification, under PNC developed programs, which in some cases may operate similarly to HAMP. These programs first require a reduction of the interest rate followed by an extension of term and, if appropriate, deferral of principal payments. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, 2,701 accounts with a balance of $478 million and 1,027 accounts with a balance of $262 million, respectively, of residential real estate loans have been modified under HAMP and were still outstanding on our balance sheet. We do not re modify a defaulted modified loan except for subsequent significant life events, as defined by the OCC. A re modified loan continues to be classified as a TDR for the remainder of its term regardless of subsequent payment performance. Commercial Loan Modifications and Payment Plans Modifications of terms for large commercial loans are based on individual facts and circumstances. Commercial loan modifications may involve reduction of the interest rate, extension of the term of the loan and or forgiveness of principal. Modified large commercial loans are usually already nonperforming prior to modification. Beginning in 2010, we established certain commercial loan modification and payment programs for small business loans, Small Business Administration loans, and investment real estate loans. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, $81 million and $88 million, respectively, in loan balances were covered under these modification and payment plan programs. Of these loan balances, $24 million have been determined to be TDRs as of December 31, 2011. No balances were considered TDRs at December 31, 2010. As noted below, we adopted new TDR guidance, effective retroactively to January 1, 2011. Troubled Debt Restructurings In the third quarter of 2011, we adopted new accounting guidance pertaining to TDRs, which was effective retroactive to January 1, 2011. For additional information, see Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 5 Asset Quality and Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. A TDR is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. TDRs typically result from our loss mitigation activities and include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization, and extensions, which are intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. For the year ended December 31, 2011, $2.7 billion of loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option, pooled purchased impaired loans, as well as certain consumer government insured or guaranteed loans which were evaluated for TDR consideration, are not classified as TDRs. 80 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

However, since our policy is to exempt these loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance as generally these loans are directly charged off in the period that they become 180 days past due, these loans are excluded from nonperforming loans. (b) Accruing loans have demonstrated a period of at least six months of performance under the restructured terms and are excluded from nonperforming loans. Total TDRs increased $545 million or 33% during 2011 to $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2011. Of this total, nonperforming TDRs totaled $1.1 billion, which represents approximately 32% of total nonperforming loans. However, as the economy has continued to slowly improve, the amount of TDRs returning to performing status has been increasing as noted below. TDRs that have returned to performing (accruing) status are excluded from nonperforming loans. These loans have demonstrated a period of at least six months of consecutive performance under the restructured terms. These TDRs increased $228 million or 42% during 2011 to $771 million as of December 31, 2011. This increase reflects the further seasoning and performance of the TDRs.

ALLOWANCES FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES AND UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT We recorded $1.6 billion in net charge offs for the full year of 2011, compared to $2.9 billion in the full year of 2010. Commercial lending net charge offs fell from $1.6 billion in the full year of 2010 to $712 million in the full year of 2011. Consumer lending net charge offs declined from $1.3 billion in the full year of 2010 to $927 million in the full year of 2011.

This treatment also results in a lower ratio of net charge offs to average loans. See Note 6 Purchased Impaired Loans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on net charge offs related to these loans. We maintain an ALLL to absorb losses from the loan portfolio and determine this allowance based on quarterly assessments of the estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio. We maintain the ALLL at a level that we believe to be appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. While we make allocations to specific loans and pools of loans, the total reserve is available for all loan and lease losses. Although quantitative modeling factors as discussed below are constantly changing as the financial strength of the borrower and overall economic conditions change, there were no significant changes during the full year of 2011 to the methodology we follow to determine our ALLL. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K 81 Table of Contents We establish specific allowances for loans considered impaired using methods prescribed by GAAP. All impaired loans are subject to individual analysis, except leases and large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans which may include, but are not limited to, credit card, residential mortgage, and consumer installment loans. Specific allowances for individual loans (including commercial and consumer TDRs) are determined based on an analysis of the present value of expected future cash flows from the loans discounted at their effective interest rate, observable market price, or the fair value of the underlying collateral. Allocations to non impaired commercial loan classes are based on PD and LGD credit risk ratings. Our pool reserve methodology is sensitive to changes in key risk parameters such as PDs, LGDs and EADs. In general, a given change in any of the major risk parameters will have a corresponding change in the pool reserve allocations for non impaired commercial loans. Our commercial loans are the largest category of credits and are most sensitive to changes in the key risk parameters and pool reserve loss rates. To illustrate, if we increase the pool reserve LGD by 5% for all categories of non impaired commercial loans, then the aggregate of the ALLL and allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit would increase by $72 million. The majority of the commercial portfolio is secured by collateral, including loans to asset based lending customers that continue to show demonstrably lower loss given default. Further, the large investment grade or equivalent portion of the loan portfolio has performed well and has not been subject to significant deterioration. Additionally, guarantees on loans greater than $1 million and owner guarantees for small business loans do not significantly impact our ALLL. Allocations to non impaired consumer loan classes are based upon a roll rate model which uses statistical relationships, calculated from historical data that estimate the movement of loan outstandings through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge off. The ALLL is lower than it would have been otherwise due to the accounting treatment for purchased impaired loans. This treatment also results in a lower ratio of ALLL to total loans. Loan loss reserves on the purchased impaired loans were not carried over on the date of acquisition. As of December 31, 2011, we have established reserves of $998 million for purchased impaired loans. A portion of the ALLL related to qualitative and measurement factors has been assigned to loan categories. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: Industry concentrations and conditions, Recent credit quality trends, Recent loss experience in particular portfolios, Recent macro economic factors, Changes in risk selection and underwriting standards, and Timing of available information. In addition to the ALLL, we maintain an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. We report this allowance as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We maintain the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at a level we believe is appropriate to absorb estimated probable losses on these unfunded credit facilities. We determine this amount using estimates of the probability of the ultimate funding and losses related to those credit exposures. This methodology is very similar to the one we use for determining our ALLL. We refer you to Note 5 Asset Quality and Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for further information on key asset quality indicators that we use to evaluate our portfolio and establish the allowances.

For the full year of 2011, the provision for commercial lending credit losses declined by $527 million or 75% from the full year of 2010. Similarly, the provision for consumer lending credit losses decreased $823 million or 46% from the full year of 2010. 82 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents At December 31, 2011, total ALLL to total nonperforming loans was 122%. The comparable amount for December 31, 2010 was 109%. The allowance allocated to consumer loans and lines of credit not secured by residential real estate and purchased impaired loans, which are both excluded from nonperforming loans, totaled $1.4 billion at both December 31, 2011, and 2010. See the Nonperforming Assets By Type table within this Credit Risk Management section for additional information. Excluding these balances, the allowance as a percent of nonperforming loans was 84% and 77% as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. See Note 5 Asset Quality and Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit and Note 6 Purchased Impaired Loans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report regarding changes in the ALLL and in the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS From a credit risk management perspective, we use credit default swaps (CDS) as a tool to manage risk concentrations in the credit portfolio. That risk management could come from protection purchased or sold in the form of single name or index products. When we buy loss protection by purchasing a CDS, we pay a fee to the seller, or CDS counterparty, in return for the right to receive a payment if a specified credit event occurs for a particular obligor or reference entity. When we sell protection, we receive a CDS premium from the buyer in return for PNCs obligation to pay the buyer if a specified credit event occurs for a particular obligor or reference entity. We evaluate the counterparty credit worthiness for all our CDS activities. Counterparty credit lines are approved based on a review of credit quality in accordance with our traditional credit quality standards and credit policies. The credit risk of our counterparties is monitored in the normal course of business. In addition, all counterparty credit lines are subject to collateral thresholds and exposures above these thresholds are secured. CDSs are included in the Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under GAAP table in the Financial Derivatives section of this Risk Management discussion. OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human factors, or external events. This includes losses that may arise as a result of non compliance with laws or regulations, failure to fulfill fiduciary responsibilities, as well as litigation or other legal actions. Operational risk may occur in any of our business activities and manifests itself in various ways, including but not limited to: Transaction processing errors, Unauthorized transactions and fraud by employees or third parties, Material disruption in business activities, System breaches and misuse of sensitive information, Regulatory or governmental actions, fines or penalties, and Significant legal expenses, judgments or settlements. Operational Risk Management focuses on balancing business needs, regulatory expectations and risk management priorities through a balanced, adaptive and proactive program that is designed to provide a strong governance model, sound and consistent management processes and transparent operational risk reporting across the enterprise. We manage operational risk based upon a comprehensive framework that enables the company to determine the enterprise and individual business units operational risk profile in comparison to the established risk appetite and identify operational risks that may require further mitigation. This framework is established around a set of enterprise wide policies and a system of internal controls that are designed to manage risk and to provide management with timely and accurate information about the operations of PNC. This framework employs a number of techniques to manage operational risk, including: Risk and Control Self Assessments (RCSAs) are performed at least annually across PNCs businesses, processes, systems and products. RCSA methodology is a standard process for management to self assess operational risks, evaluate control effectiveness, and determine if risk exposure is within established tolerances; Scenario Analysis is leveraged to proactively evaluate operational loss events with the potential for severe business, financial, operational or regulatory impact on the company or a major business unit. This methodology leverages standard processes and tools to evaluate a wide range of business and operational risks encompassing both external and internal events relevant to the company. Based upon scenario analysis conclusions, management may implement additional controls or risk management activities to reduce exposure to an acceptable level; A Key Risk Indicator (KRI) framework allows management to assess actual operational risk results compared to expectations and thresholds, as well as proactively identify unexpected shifts in operational risk exposure or control effectiveness. Enterprise level KRIs are designed to monitor exposure across the different inherent operational risk types. Business specific KRIs are established in support of the individual risk and control self assessments; and Operational loss events across the enterprise are continuously captured and maintained in a central repository. This information is analyzed and used to help determine the root causes of these events and to identify trends that could indicate changes in the companys risk exposure or control effectiveness. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K 83 Table of Contents PNC utilizes a number of sources to identify external loss events occurring across the financial services industry. These events are evaluated to determine whether PNC is exposed to similar events, and if so, whether the appropriate controls are in place. Operational Risk Management, Compliance and Legal professionals work closely with business areas to evaluate risks and help ensure the appropriate controls are established prior to the introduction of new or enhanced products, services, and technologies. These risk professionals also consult with business areas in the design and implementation of mitigation strategies to address risks and issues identified through ongoing assessment and monitoring activities. We are in the process of implementing a methodology to estimate capital requirements for Operational Risk using a proprietary version of an Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA). Under the AMA approach, the results of the program elements described above are key inputs directly incorporated into the capital calculation methodology. PNCs technology risk management and business resiliency programs are aligned with the operational risk framework. Our integrated security and technology risk management framework is designed to help ensure a secure, sound, and compliant infrastructure for information and system management. The technology risk management process is aligned with the strategic direction of the businesses and is integrated into the technology management culture, structure and practices. Our business resiliency program manages the organizations capabilities to provide services in the case of an event that results in material disruption of business activities. Prioritization of investments in people, processes, technology and facilities is based on different types of events, business risk and criticality. Detailed testing validates our resiliency capabilities on an ongoing basis, and an integrated governance model is designed to help assure appropriate management reporting. PNC uses insurance where appropriate to mitigate the effects of operational risk events. PNC purchases direct coverage provided by various insurers, and retains certain corporate risks via one of its two wholly owned captive insurance companies, Alpine Indemnity Limited. PNCs retention of corporate risks associated with its participation as an insurer is mitigated through policy limits. Insurance purchased in the external market is governed by PNCs Financial Stability Carrier guidelines. As a component of PNCs risk management practices, we purchase insurance designed to protect us against accidental loss or losses, which, in the aggregate, may significantly affect personnel, property, financial objectives, or our ability to continue to meet our responsibilities to our various stakeholder groups. On a quarterly basis, an enterprise operational risk report is made reporting key operational risks to senior management and the Board of Directors. The report encompasses key operational risk management conclusions, including the overall operational risk level, risk management effectiveness and outlook, grounded in quantitative measures and qualitative factors. Key enterprise operational risks are also included in the enterprise risk report. In addition, operational risk is an integrated part of the quarterly business specific risk reports. MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT PNC relies on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values. Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, grading and granting loans, measuring interest rate risks and other market risks, predicting losses, and assessing capital adequacy, as well as to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. There are risks involved in the use of models as they have the potential to provide inaccurate output or results, could be used for purposes other than those for which they have been designed, or may be operated in an uncontrolled environment where unauthorized changes can take place and where other control risks exist. Model Risk Management is responsible for policies and procedures describing how model risk is evaluated and managed, and the application of the governance process to implement these practices throughout the enterprise. To better manage our business, our practices around the use of models, and to comply with regulatory guidance and requirements, we have in place policies and procedures that define our governance processes for assessing and controlling model risk. These processes focus on identifying, reporting, and remediating any problems with the soundness, accuracy, improper use, or operating environment of our models. We recognize that models must be monitored over time to ensure their continued accuracy and functioning, and our policies also address the type and frequency of monitoring that is appropriate according to the importance of each model. There are a number of practices we undertake to identify and control model risk. A primary consideration is that models be well understood by those who use them as well as by other parties. Our policies require detailed written model documentation for significant models to assist in making their use transparent and understood by users, independent reviewers, and regulatory and auditing bodies. The documentation must include details on the data and methods used to develop each model, assumptions utilized within the model, and a description of model limitations and circumstances in which a model should not be relied upon. 84 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents Our modeling methods and data are reviewed by independent model reviewers not involved in the development of the model to identify possible errors or areas where the soundness of the model could be in question. Issues identified by the independent reviewer are tracked and reported using our existing governance structure until the issue has been fully remediated. It is important that models operate in a controlled environment where access to code or the ability to make changes is limited to those so authorized. Additionally, proper back up and recovery mechanisms are needed for the ongoing functioning of models. Our use of independent model control reviewers aids in the evaluation of the existing control mechanisms to help ensure that controls are appropriate and are functioning properly. LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT Liquidity risk has two fundamental components. The first is potential loss assuming we were unable to meet our funding requirements at a reasonable cost. The second is the potential inability to operate our businesses because adequate contingent liquidity is not available in a stressed environment. We manage liquidity risk at the consolidated company level (bank, parent company, and nonbank subsidiaries combined) to help ensure that we can obtain cost effective funding to meet current and future obligations under both normal business as usual and stressful circumstances, and to help ensure that we maintain an appropriate level of contingent liquidity. Spot and forward funding gap analyses are used to measure and monitor consolidated liquidity risk. Funding gaps represent the difference in projected sources of liquidity available to offset projected uses. We calculate funding gaps for the overnight, thirty day, ninety day, one hundred eighty day and one year time intervals. Management also monitors liquidity through a series of early warning indicators that may indicate a potential market, or PNC specific, liquidity stress event. Finally, management performs a set of liquidity stress tests and maintains a contingency funding plan to address a potential liquidity crisis. In the most severe liquidity stress simulation, we assume that PNCs liquidity position is under pressure, while the market in general is under systemic pressure. The simulation considers, among other things, the impact of restricted access to both secured and unsecured external sources of funding, accelerated run off of customer deposits, valuation pressure on assets, and heavy demand to fund contingent obligations. Risk limits are established within our Liquidity Risk Policy. Managements Asset and Liability Committee regularly reviews compliance with the established limits. Parent company liquidity guidelines are designed to help ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet our parent company obligations over the succeeding 24 month period. Risk limits for parent company liquidity are established within our Enterprise Capital and Liquidity Management Policy. The Board of Directors Risk Committee regularly reviews compliance with the established limits. Bank Level Liquidity Uses Obligations requiring the use of liquidity can generally be characterized as either contractual or discretionary. At the bank level, primary contractual obligations include funding loan commitments, satisfying deposit withdrawal requests and maturities and debt service related to bank borrowings. We also maintain adequate bank liquidity to meet future potential loan demand and provide for other business needs, as necessary. As of December 31, 2011, there were approximately $7.3 billion of bank borrowings with contractual maturities of less than one year. Bank Level Liquidity Sources Our largest source of bank liquidity on a consolidated basis is the deposit base that comes from our retail and commercial businesses. Liquid assets and unused borrowing capacity from a number of sources are also available to maintain our liquidity position. Borrowed funds come from a diverse mix of short and long term funding sources. At December 31, 2011, our liquid assets consisted of short term investments (Federal funds sold, resale agreements, trading securities, and interest earning deposits with banks) totaling $5.9 billion and securities available for sale totaling $48.6 billion. Of our total liquid assets of $54.5 billion, we had $20.1 billion pledged as collateral for borrowings, trust, and other commitments. The level of liquid assets fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market conditions, loan and deposit growth and active balance sheet management. In addition to the customer deposit base, which has historically provided the single largest source of relatively stable and low cost funding and liquid assets, the bank also obtains liquidity through the issuance of traditional forms of funding including long term debt (senior notes and subordinated debt and FHLB advances) and short term borrowings (Federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper issuances, and other short term borrowings). PNC Bank, N.A. has the ability to offer up to $20 billion in senior and subordinated unsecured debt obligations with maturities of more than nine months. Through December 31, 2011, PNC Bank, N.A. had issued $6.9 billion of debt under this program. Total senior and subordinated debt declined to $4.1 billion at December 31, 2011 from $5.5 billion at December 31, 2010 due to contractual maturities. PNC Bank, N.A. is a member of the FHLB Pittsburgh and as such has access to advances from FHLB Pittsburgh secured generally by residential mortgage and other mortgage related loans. At December 31, 2011, our unused secured borrowing capacity was $10.6 billion with FHLB Pittsburgh. Total The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K 85 Table of Contents FHLB borrowings increased to $7.0 billion at December 31, 2011 from $6.0 billion at December 31, 2010 due to $2.0 billion in new borrowings partially offset by maturities. PNC Bank, N.A. has the ability to offer up to $3.0 billion of its commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2011, there were no issuances outstanding under this program. Other borrowed funds on our Consolidated Balance Sheet includes $4.3 billion of commercial paper issued by Market Street Funding LLC, a consolidated VIE. PNC Bank, N.A. can also borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Clevelands (Federal Reserve Bank) discount window to meet short term liquidity requirements. The Federal Reserve Bank, however, is not viewed as the primary means of funding our routine business activities, but rather as a potential source of liquidity in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. These potential borrowings are secured by securities and commercial loans. At December 31, 2011, our unused secured borrowing capacity was $26.9 billion with the Federal Reserve Bank. Parent Company Liquidity Uses Obligations requiring the use of liquidity can generally be characterized as either contractual or discretionary. The parent companys contractual obligations consist primarily of debt service related to parent company borrowings and funding non bank affiliates. Additionally, the parent company maintains adequate liquidity to fund discretionary activities such as paying dividends to PNC shareholders, share repurchases, and acquisitions. As of December 31, 2011, there were approximately $4.0 billion of parent company borrowings with contractual maturities of less than one year. In addition, we will use approximately $3.5 billion of parent company cash and short term investments to acquire RBC Bank (USA) in March 2012. See Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this Report for information regarding the Federal Reserves current supervisory assessment of capital adequacy program (the 2012 CCAR), including its impact on our ability to take certain capital actions, including plans to pay or increase common stock dividends or to reinstate or increase common stock repurchase programs. See Capital and Liquidity Actions in the Executive Summary section of this Item 7 for additional information regarding our December 2011 announcement that the Federal Reserve approved the acquisition of RBC Bank (USA) and that the OCC approved the merger of RBC Bank (USA) with and into PNC Bank, N.A. with these transactions scheduled to close March 2012, our November 2011 redemption of trust preferred securities, our September 2011 issuance of senior notes, our July 2011 issuance of preferred stock, and our April 2011 increase to PNCs quarterly common stock dividend. We did not repurchase any shares under PNCs existing common stock repurchase program in 2011. Parent Company Liquidity Sources The principal source of parent company liquidity is the dividends it receives from its subsidiary bank, which may be impacted by the following: Bank level capital needs, Laws and regulations, Corporate policies, Contractual restrictions, and Other factors. The amount available for dividend payments by PNC Bank, N.A. to the parent company without prior regulatory approval was approximately $1.7 billion at December 31, 2011. There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of national banks to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the parent company or its non bank subsidiaries. See Note 21 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for a further discussion of these limitations. Dividends may also be impacted by the banks capital needs and by contractual restrictions. We provide additional information on certain contractual restrictions under the Trust Preferred Securities section of the Off Balance Sheet Arrangements And Variable Interest Entities section of this Item 7 and in Note 13 Capital Securities of Subsidiary Trusts and Perpetual Trust Securities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. In addition to dividends from PNC Bank, N.A., other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and short term investments, as well as dividends and loan repayments from other subsidiaries and dividends or distributions from equity investments. As of December 31, 2011, the parent company had approximately $7.8 billion in funds available from its cash and short term investments. We can also generate liquidity for the parent company and PNCs non bank subsidiaries through the issuance of debt securities and equity securities, including certain capital securities, in public or private markets and commercial paper. We have effective shelf registration statements pursuant to which we can issue additional debt and equity securities, including certain hybrid capital instruments. Total senior and subordinated debt and hybrid capital instruments declined to $16.0 billion at December 31, 2011 from $17.3 billion at December 31, 2010 due to maturities. During 2011 we issued the following securities under our shelf registration statement: $1.25 billion of senior notes issued September 19, 2011 and due September 2016. Interest is paid semi annually at a fixed rate of 2.70%, One million depositary shares, each representing a 1/100th interest in a share of our Fixed to Floating Rate Non Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series O, issued July 27, 2011, resulting in gross proceeds to us before commissions and expenses of $1 billion. 86 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents The parent company, through its subsidiary PNC Funding Corp, has the ability to offer up to $3.0 billion of commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2011, there were no issuances outstanding under this program. Note 18 Equity in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report describes our February 2010 redemption of all 75,792 shares of our Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Shares, Series N (Series N Preferred Stock) that had been issued on December 31, 2008 to the US Treasury under the TARP Capital Purchase Program, the acceleration of the accretion of the remaining issuance discount on the Series N Preferred Stock in the first quarter of 2010 (and a corresponding reduction in retained earnings of $250 million in the first quarter of 2010), and the exchange by the US Treasury of the TARP warrant issued to it on December 31, 2008 into warrants, each to purchase one share of PNC common stock at an exercise price of $67.33, sold by the US Treasury in a secondary public offering in May 2010. These common stock warrants will expire December 31, 2018. Status of Credit Ratings The cost and availability of short term and long term funding, as well as collateral requirements for certain derivative instruments, is influenced by PNCs debt ratings. In general, rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, level and quality of earnings, and the current legislative and regulatory environment, including implied government support. In addition, rating agencies themselves have been subject to scrutiny arising from the financial crisis and could make or be required to make substantial changes to their ratings policies and practices, particularly in response to legislative and regulatory changes, including as a result of provisions in Dodd Frank. Potential changes in the legislative and regulatory environment and the timing of those changes could impact our ratings, which as noted above, could impact our liquidity and financial condition. A decrease, or potential decrease, in credit ratings could impact access to the capital markets and or increase the cost of debt, and thereby adversely affect liquidity and financial condition. Credit ratings as of December 31, 2011 for PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. follow: Moodys Standard&Poors Fitch The PNC FinancialServices Group, Inc.

(b) Includes basis adjustment relating to accounting hedges. (c) Includes purchase obligations for goods and services covered by noncancellable contracts and contracts including cancellation fees. At December 31, 2011, unrecognized tax benefits totaled $209 million. This liability for unrecognized tax benefits represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which ultimately may not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, this estimated liability has been excluded from the contractual obligations table. See Note 20 Income Taxes in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K 87 Table of Contents Our contractual obligations totaled $84.6 billion at December 31, 2010. The decline in the comparison is primarily attributable to decreases in the remaining contractual maturities of time deposits and borrowed funds.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW Market risk is the risk of a loss in earnings or economic value due to adverse movements in market factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices. We are exposed to market risk primarily by our involvement in the following activities, among others: Traditional banking activities of taking deposits and extending loans, Equity and other investments and activities whose economic values are directly impacted by market factors, and Trading in fixed income products, equities, derivatives, and foreign exchange, as a result of customer activities and underwriting. We have established enterprise wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor, and report market risk. Market Risk Management provides independent oversight by monitoring compliance with these limits and guidelines, and reporting significant risks in the business to the Risk Committee of the Board. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT INTEREST RATE RISK Interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates, and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of our noninterest bearing funding sources. Due to the repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities. Asset and Liability Management centrally manages interest rate risk set forth in our risk management policies approved by managements Asset and Liability Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board. Sensitivity results and market interest rate benchmarks for the fourth quarters of 2011 and 2010 follow: Interest Sensitivity Analysis FourthQuarter2011 FourthQuarter2010 Net Interest Income Sensitivity Simulation Effect on net interest income in first year from gradual interest rate change over following 12 months of: 100 basis point increase 2.3 % 1.4 % 100 basis point decrease (a) (1.5 )% (1.4 )% Effect on net interest income in second year from gradual interest rate change over the preceding 12 months of: 100 basis point increase 7.1 % 4.1 % 100 basis point decrease (a) (4.4 )% (4.8 )% Duration of Equity Model (a) Base case duration of equity (in years): (6.2 ) (.5 ) Key Period End Interest Rates One month LIBOR .30 % .26 % Three year swap .82 % 1.28 % (a) Given the inherent limitations in certain of these measurement tools and techniques, results become less meaningful as interest rates approach zero. In addition to measuring the effect on net interest income assuming parallel changes in current interest rates, we routinely simulate the effects of a number of nonparallel interest rate environments. The following Net Interest Income Sensitivity to Alternative Rate Scenarios table reflects the percentage change in net interest income over the next two 12 month periods assuming (i) the PNC Economists most likely rate forecast, (ii) implied market forward rates, and (iii) a Two Ten Slope decrease (a 200 basis point decrease between two year and ten year rates superimposed on current base rates) scenario. 88 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents Net Interest Income Sensitivity to Alternative Rate Scenarios (Fourth Quarter 2011) PNCEconomist MarketForward Two TenSlope First year sensitivity .9 % .8 % .4 % Second year sensitivity 4.1 % 3.1 % .9 % All changes in forecasted net interest income are relative to results in a base rate scenario where current market rates are assumed to remain unchanged over the forecast horizon. When forecasting net interest income, we make assumptions about interest rates and the shape of the yield curve, the volume and characteristics of new business, and the behavior of existing on and off balance sheet positions. These assumptions determine the future level of simulated net interest income in the base interest rate scenario and the other interest rate scenarios presented in the above table. These simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature, they are replaced or repriced at then current market rates. We also consider forward projections of purchase accounting accretion when forecasting net interest income. The following graph presents the yield curves for the base rate scenario and each of the alternate scenarios one year forward. The fourth quarter 2011 interest sensitivity analyses indicate that our Consolidated Balance Sheet is positioned to benefit from an increase in interest rates and an upward sloping interest rate yield curve. We believe that we have the deposit funding base and balance sheet flexibility to adjust, where appropriate and permissible, to changing interest rates and market conditions. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT TRADING RISK Our trading activities are primarily customer driven trading in fixed income securities, derivatives, and foreign exchange contracts. They also include the underwriting of fixed income and equity securities. We use value at risk (VaR) as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in trading activities. We calculate VaR at both a 99% non diversified and 95% diversified confidence interval. The 99% VaR is used for computing our regulatory market risk capital charge while 95% VaR is used for internal management reporting. PNC began measuring enterprise wide VaR internally on a diversified basis at a 95% confidence interval in the second quarter of 2011. We believe a diversified VaR is a better representation of risk as it reflects empirical correlations across different asset classes. Additionally, moving to a 95% confidence level provides a more stable measure of the VaR for day to day risk management. During 2011, our 95% VaR ranged between $.4 million and $3.5 million, averaging $.8 million. During 2011, our 99% non diversified VaR ranged between $1.0 million and $6.8 million, averaging $1.8 million. During 2010, our VaR ranged between $2.3 million and $8.8 million, averaging $5.4 million. To help ensure the integrity of the models used to calculate VaR for each portfolio and enterprise wide, we use a process known as backtesting. The backtesting process consists of comparing actual observations of trading related gains or losses against the VaR levels that were calculated at the close of the prior day. Over a typical business cycle, we would expect an average of twelve to thirteen instances a year in which actual losses exceeded the prior day VaR measure at the enterprise wide level at a 95% confidence interval. There were no such instances during the year ended December 31, 2011 under our diversified VaR measure. We use a 500 day look back period for backtesting and include customer related revenue. Including customer revenue helps to reduce trading losses and therefore, there were no instances of actual losses exceeding the prior day VaR measure. The following graph shows a comparison of enterprise wide trading related gains and losses against prior day diversified VaR for the period. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K 89 Table of Contents Total trading revenue was as follows: Trading Revenue Year ended December 31 In millions 2011 2010 2009 Net interest income $ 43 $ 55 $ 61 Noninterest income 225 183 170 Total trading revenue $ 268 $ 238 $ 231 Securities underwriting and trading (a) $ 81 $ 94 $ 75 Foreign exchange 88 76 73 Financial derivatives and other 99 68 83 Total trading revenue $ 268 $ 238 $ 231 (a) Includes changes in fair value for certain loans accounted for at fair value. The trading revenue disclosed above includes results from providing investing and risk management services to our customers as well as results from hedges of customer activity. Trading revenue excludes the impact of economic hedging activities which we transact to manage risk primarily related to residential mortgage servicing rights, residential and commercial mortgage loans held for sale, and certain residential mortgage backed agency securities with embedded derivatives. Derivatives used for economic hedges are not designated as accounting hedges because the contracts they are hedging are typically also carried at fair value on the balance sheet, resulting in symmetrical accounting treatment for both the hedging instrument and the hedged item. Economic hedge results are reported in noninterest income along with the associated hedge items. Trading revenue for 2011 increased $30 million compared with 2010 primarily due to higher derivatives and foreign exchange client sales revenues, improved client related trading results, and the reduced impact of counterparty credit risk on valuations of derivative positions. These increases were partially offset by lower underwriting activity. Trading revenue increased $7 million in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to higher underwriting and derivatives client sales revenue, partially offset by reduced proprietary and customer related trading results. Proprietary trading positions were essentially eliminated by the end of the second quarter of 2010. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENT RISK Equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. PNC invests primarily in private equity markets. In addition to extending credit, taking deposits, and underwriting and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations, and growth financings in a variety of industries. We also have investments in affiliated and non affiliated funds that make similar investments in private equity and in debt and equity oriented hedge funds. The economic and or book value of these investments and other assets such as loan servicing rights are directly affected by changes in market factors. The primary risk measurement for equity and other investments is economic capital. Economic capital is a common measure of risk for credit, market and operational risk. It is an estimate of the potential value depreciation over a one year horizon commensurate with solvency expectations of an institution rated single A by the credit rating agencies. Given the illiquid nature of many of these types of investments, it can be a challenge to determine their fair values. See Note 8 Fair Value in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Various PNC business units manage our equity and other investment activities. Our businesses are responsible for making investment decisions within the approved policy limits and associated guidelines. A summary of our equity investments follows: In millions Dec. 312011 Dec. 312010 BlackRock $ 5,291 $5,017 Tax credit investments 2,646 2,054 Private equity 1,491 1,375 Visa 456 456 Other 250 318 Total $ 10,134 $ 9,220 BlackRock PNC owned approximately 36 million common stock equivalent shares of BlackRock equity at December 31, 2011, accounted for under the equity method. The primary risk measurement, similar to other equity investments, is economic capital. The Business Segments Review section of this Item 7 includes additional information about BlackRock. Tax Credit Investments Included in our equity investments are tax credit investments which are accounted for under the equity method. These investments, as well as equity investments held by consolidated partnerships, totaled $2.6 billion at December 31, 2011 and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2010. Private Equity The private equity portfolio is an illiquid portfolio comprised of mezzanine and equity investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment. Private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $1.5 billion at December 31, 2011 and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2011, $856 million was invested directly in a variety of companies and $635 million was invested indirectly through various private equity 90 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents funds. Included in direct investments are investment activities of two private equity funds that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes. The noncontrolling interests of these funds totaled $241 million as of December 31, 2011. The indirect private equity funds are not redeemable, but PNC receives distributions over the life of the partnership from liquidation of the underlying investments by the investee. Our unfunded commitments related to private equity totaled $247 million at December 31, 2011 compared with $319 million at December 31, 2010. Visa At December 31, 2011, our investment in Visa Class B common shares totaled approximately 23 million shares. In March 2011, Visa funded $400 million to their litigation escrow account and reduced the conversion ratio of Visa B to A shares. We consequently recognized our estimated $38 million share of the $400 million as a reduction of our previously established indemnification liability and a reduction of noninterest expense. In December 2011, Visa funded $1.6 billion to their litigation escrow account and reduced the conversion ratio of Visa B to A shares. We consequently recognized $32 million as a reduction of our previously established indemnification liability and a reduction of noninterest expense. As of December 31, 2011, our recognized Visa indemnification liability was zero. As we continue to have an obligation to indemnify Visa for judgments and settlements for the remaining specified litigation, we may have additional exposure in the future to the specified Visa litigation. As of December 31, 2011, we had recognized $456 million of our Visa ownership. Based on the December 31, 2011 closing price of $101.53 for the Visa Class A shares, the market value of our total investment was approximately $1.0 billion at the current conversion ratio which considers all litigation funding by Visa to date. The Visa Class B common shares we own generally will not be transferable, except under limited circumstances, until they can be converted into shares of the publicly traded class of stock, which cannot happen until the settlement of all of the specified litigation. It is expected that Visa will continue to adjust the conversion ratio of Visa Class B to Class A shares in connection with any settlements in excess of any amounts then in escrow for that purpose and will also reduce the conversion ratio to the extent that it adds any funds to the escrow in the future. Note 23 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report has further information on our Visa indemnification obligation. Other Investments We also make investments in affiliated and non affiliated funds with both traditional and alternative investment strategies. The economic values could be driven by either the fixed income market or the equity markets, or both. At December 31, 2011, other investments totaled $250 million compared with $318 million at December 31, 2010. We recognized net gains related to these investments of $1 million during 2011, compared with $43 million during 2010. Given the nature of these investments, if market conditions affecting their valuation were to worsen, we could incur future losses. Our unfunded commitments related to other investments totaled $3 million at December 31, 2011 and $11 million at December 31, 2010. IMPACT OF INFLATION Our assets and liabilities are primarily financial in nature and typically have varying maturity dates. Accordingly, future changes in prices do not affect the obligations to pay or receive fixed and determinable amounts of money. However, during periods of inflation, there may be a subsequent impact affecting certain fixed costs or expenses, an erosion of consumer and customer purchasing power, and fluctuations in the needs or demand for our products and services. Should significant levels of inflation occur, our business could potentially be impacted by, among other things, reducing our tolerance for extending credit or causing us to incur additional credit losses resulting from possible increased default rates. FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES We use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage interest rate, market and credit risk inherent in our business activities. Substantially all such instruments are used to manage risk related to changes in interest rates. Interest rate and total return swaps, interest rate caps and floors, swaptions, options, forwards and futures contracts are the primary instruments we use for interest rate risk management. We also enter into derivatives with customers to facilitate their risk management activities. Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, interest rate, market and credit risk. For interest rate swaps and total return swaps, options and futures contracts, only periodic cash payments and, with respect to options, premiums are exchanged. Therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount on these instruments. Further information on our financial derivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 16 Financial Derivatives in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, which is incorporated here by reference. Not all elements of interest rate, market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial or other derivatives, and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market changes, among other reasons.

For 2010, net income attributable to common shareholders and diluted earnings per common share were impacted by a noncash reduction of $250 million related to our redemption of TARP preferred stock. Net Interest Income Net interest income was $9.2 billion for 2010 up 2% from 2009, while the net interest margin rose to 4.14% in 2010 compared with 3.82% for 2009. Noninterest Income Summary Noninterest income was $5.9 billion for 2010 and $7.1 billion for 2009. The primary driver of this change was a reduction of $916 million for BlackRock related transactions. During fourth quarter 2010, we realized a pretax gain of $160 million on 7.5 million BlackRock common shares sold by PNC as a part of a BlackRock secondary common stock offering. During fourth quarter 2009, we recognized a $1.1 billion pretax gain related to BlackRocks acquisition of Barclays Global Investors (BGI). Asset management revenue was $1.1 billion in 2010 compared with $858 million in 2009. This increase reflected higher equity earnings from our BlackRock investment, improved equity markets and client growth. Discretionary assets under management at December 31, 2010 totaled $108 billion compared with $103 billion at December 31, 2009. Consumer services fees totaled $1.3 billion in both 2010 and 2009. Consumer service fees for 2010 reflected higher volume related transaction fees offset by lower brokerage fees and the impact of the January 1, 2010 consolidation of the securitized credit card portfolio. Corporate services revenue totaled $1.1 billion in 2010 and $1.0 billion in 2009. The increase was largely the result of higher merger and acquisition advisory and ancillary commercial mortgage servicing fees partially offset by a reduction in the value of commercial mortgage servicing rights largely driven by lower interest rates. Corporate services fees include the noninterest component of treasury management fees, which continued to be a strong contributor to revenue. Residential mortgage revenue totaled $699 million in 2010 compared with $990 million in 2009. The decline in 2010 reflected reduced loan sales revenue following the strong loan origination refinance volume in 2009 and lower net hedging gains on mortgage servicing rights. There were lower service charges on deposits of $245 million in 2010 compared with 2009, partially resulting from the negative impact of the new Regulation E rules. Net securities gains increased by $128 million in 2010 compared with 2009 due to lower net credit related OTTI partially offset by lower gains on sales of securities. Gains on BlackRock related transactions included a fourth quarter 2010 pretax gain of $160 million from our sale of 7.5 million BlackRock common shares as part of a BlackRock secondary common stock offering. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we recognized a $1.1 billion pretax gain on PNCs portion of the increase in BlackRocks equity resulting from the value of BlackRock shares issued by BlackRock in connection with its acquisition of BGI. Other noninterest income totaled $884 million for 2010 compared with $987 million for 2009. Other noninterest income for 2009 included gains of $103 million primarily related to our BlackRock LTIP shares obligation. Other noninterest income for 2010 included net gains on alternative investments, including private equity, of $258 million, compared with net losses on alternative investments, including private equity, of $93 million in 2009. Gains on sales of loans were $73 million in 2010 and $220 million in 2009. Provision For Credit Losses The provision for credit losses totaled $2.5 billion for 2010 compared with $3.9 billion for 2009. The lower provision in 2010 reflected credit exposure reductions and overall improved credit migration during 2010. Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense for 2010 declined 5%, to $8.6 billion, compared with $9.1 billion for 2009. The impact of higher cost savings related to the National City acquisition integration and the reversal of certain accrued liabilities in 2010, including $73 million associated with a franchise tax settlement and $123 million associated with an indemnification liability for certain Visa litigation, were reflected in the lower 2010 expenses. Lower expenses in the comparison also reflected a special FDIC assessment, intended to build the FDICs Deposit Insurance Fund, of $133 million in 2009. We also continued to invest in customer growth and innovation initiatives. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K 93 Table of Contents National City integration costs included in noninterest expense totaled $387 million in 2010 and $421 million in 2009. We achieved National City acquisition cost savings of $1.8 billion on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter of 2010 through the reduction of operational and administrative redundancies. This amount was higher than our original goal of $1.2 billion, and ahead of schedule. During 2010, we completed the customer and branch conversions to our technology platforms and integrated the businesses and operations of National City with those of PNC. Effective Tax Rate Our effective tax rate was 25.5% for 2010 and 26.9% for 2009. CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET REVIEW Loans Loans decreased $6.9 billion, or 4%, to $150.6 billion as of December 31, 2010 compared with December 31, 2009. An increase in loans of $3.5 billion from the initial consolidation of Market Street and the securitized credit card portfolio effective January 1, 2010 was more than offset by the impact of soft customer loan demand combined with loan repayments and payoffs in the portfolio. Loans represented 57% of total assets at December 31, 2010 and 58% at December 31, 2009. Commercial lending represented 53% of the loan portfolio and consumer lending represented 47% at both December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. Commercial real estate loans represented 7% of total assets at December 31, 2010 and 9% of total assets at December 31, 2009. Investment Securities The carrying amount of investment securities totaled $64.3 billion at December 31, 2010, an increase of $8.3 billion, or 15%, from $56.0 billion at December 31, 2009. The increase in investment securities primarily reflected an increase in securities available for sale as excess liquidity was invested in short duration, high quality securities. Investment securities represented 24% of total assets at December 31, 2010 and 21% at December 31, 2009. In March 2010, we transferred $2.2 billion of available for sale commercial mortgage backed non agency securities to the held to maturity portfolio. The transfer involved high quality securities where managements intent to hold changed. At December 31, 2010, the securities available for sale portfolio included a net unrealized loss of $861 million, which represented the difference between fair value and amortized cost. The comparable amount at December 31, 2009 was a net unrealized loss of $2.3 billion. The expected weighted average life of investment securities (excluding corporate stocks and other) was 4.7 years at December 31, 2010 and 4.1 years at December 31, 2009. Loans Held For Sale Loans held for sale totaled $3.5 billion at December 31, 2010 compared with $2.5 billion at December 31, 2009. We stopped originating certain commercial mortgage loans designated as held for sale during the first quarter of 2008 and continue pursuing opportunities to reduce these positions at appropriate prices. We sold $241 million of commercial mortgage loans held for sale carried at fair value in 2010 and sold $272 million in 2009. Residential mortgage loan origination volume was $10.5 billion in 2010. Substantially all such loans were originated under agency or Federal Housing Administration (FHA) standards. We sold $10.0 billion of loans and recognized related gains of $231 million during 2010. The comparable amounts for 2009 were $19.8 billion and $435 million, respectively. Asset Quality Nonperforming assets decreased $1.1 billion to $5.1 billion at December 31, 2010 compared with $6.2 billion at December 31, 2009. Nonperforming loans decreased $1.2 billion to $4.5 billion since December 31, 2009 while OREO and foreclosed assets increased $124 million to $657 million. The decrease in nonperforming loans was primarily due to improvements in our commercial lending and residential real estate portfolios, partially offset by increases in our consumer home equity portfolio. These consumer home equity nonperforming loan increases were largely due to increases in troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). At December 31, 2010, our largest nonperforming asset was $35 million in the Accommodation and Food Services Industry and our average nonperforming loan associated with commercial lending was approximately $1 million. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $10.8 billion at December 31, 2010 compared with $12.9 billion at December, 31, 2009. Goodwill declined $1.4 billion, to $8.1 billion, at December 31, 2010 compared with the December 31, 2009 balance primarily due to the sale of GIS which reduced goodwill by $1.2 billion. The $.8 billion decline in other intangible assets from December 31, 2009 included $.3 billion declines in both commercial and residential mortgage servicing rights due primarily to the sale of commercial mortgage servicing rights and residential mortgage servicing rights value changes resulting primarily from market driven changes in interest rates. Funding Sources Total funding sources were $222.9 billion at December 31, 2010 and $226.2 billion at December 31, 2009. Funding sources decreased $3.3 billion, primarily driven by declines in retail certificates of deposit and Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, partially offset by increases in demand deposits and other borrowings. 94 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents Total deposits decreased $3.5 billion at December 31, 2010 compared with December 31, 2009. Deposits decreased in the comparison primarily due to declines in retail certificates of deposit, time deposits in foreign offices and money market deposits, partially offset by an increase in demand deposits. Total borrowed funds increased $.2 billion to $39.5 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009. Other borrowed funds increased in the comparison primarily due to the consolidation of Market Street and a credit card securitization trust. Additionally, bank notes and senior debt increased since December 31, 2009 due to net issuances. These increases were partially offset in the comparison by a decline of Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings. PNC issued $3.25 billion of senior notes in 2010. In March 2009, PNC issued $1.0 billion of floating rate senior notes guaranteed by the FDIC under the FDICs TLGP Debt Guarantee Program (TLGP). In addition, PNC issued $1.5 billion of senior notes during the second and third quarters of 2009 that were not issued under the TLGP. Shareholders Equity Total shareholders equity increased $.3 billion, to $30.2 billion, at December 31, 2010 compared with December 31, 2009 and included the impact of the following: The first quarter 2010 issuance of 63.9 million shares of common stock in an underwritten offering at $54 per share resulted in a $3.4 billion increase in total shareholders equity, An increase of $2.7 billion to retained earnings, and A $1.5 billion decline in accumulated other comprehensive loss largely due to decreases in net unrealized securities losses. The factors above were mostly offset by a decline of $7.3 billion in capital surplus preferred stock in connection with our February 2010 redemption of the Series N (TARP) Preferred Stock as explained further in Note 18 Equity in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2010 were 10.2% for leverage, 12.1% for Tier 1 risk based and 15.6% for total risk based capital. At December 31, 2009, the regulatory capital ratios were 10.1% for leverage, 11.4% for Tier 1 risk based and 15.0% for total risk based capital. The increase in Tier 1 risk based capital was attributable to retention of earnings in 2010, the first quarter 2010 equity offering, the third quarter 2010 sale of GIS, and lower risk weighted assets. GLOSSARY OF TERMS Accretable net interest (Accretable yield) The excess of cash flows expected to be collected on a purchased impaired loan over the carrying value of the loan. The accretable net interest is recognized into interest income over the remaining life of the loan using the constant effective yield method. Adjusted average total assets Primarily comprised of total average quarterly (or annual) assets plus (less) unrealized losses (gains) on investment securities, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (net of eligible deferred taxes). Annualized Adjusted to reflect a full year of activity. Assets under management Assets over which we have sole or shared investment authority for our customers/clients. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Basis point One hundredth of a percentage point. Carrying value of purchased impaired loans The net value on the balance sheet which represents the recorded investment less any valuation allowance. Cash recoveries Cash recoveries used in the context of purchased impaired loans represent cash payments from customers that exceeded the recorded investment of the designated impaired loan. Charge off Process of removing a loan or portion of a loan from our balance sheet because it is considered uncollectible. We also record a charge off when a loan is transferred from portfolio holdings to held for sale by reducing the loan carrying amount to the fair value of the loan, if fair value is less than carrying amount. Combined Loan to value ratio (CLTV) This is the aggregate principal balance(s) of the mortgages on a property divided by its appraised value or purchase price. Commercial mortgage banking activities Includes commercial mortgage servicing, originating commercial mortgages for sale and related hedging activities. Commercial mortgage banking activities revenue includes commercial mortgage servicing (including net interest income and noninterest income from loan servicing and ancillary services, net of commercial mortgage servicing rights amortization, and commercial mortgage servicing rights valuations), and revenue derived from commercial mortgage loans intended for sale and related hedges (including loan origination fees, net interest income, valuation adjustments and gains or losses on sales). Common shareholders equity to total assets Common shareholders equity divided by total assets. Common shareholders equity equals total shareholders equity less the liquidation value of preferred stock. Core net interest income Total net interest income less purchase accounting accretion. Credit derivatives Contractual agreements, primarily credit default swaps, that provide protection against a credit event of one or more referenced credits. The nature of a credit event is The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K 95 Table of Contents established by the protection buyer and protection seller at the inception of a transaction, and such events include bankruptcy, insolvency and failure to meet payment obligations when due. The buyer of the credit derivative pays a periodic fee in return for a payment by the protection seller upon the occurrence, if any, of a credit event. Credit spread The difference in yield between debt issues of similar maturity. The excess of yield attributable to credit spread is often used as a measure of relative creditworthiness, with a reduction in the credit spread reflecting an improvement in the borrowers perceived creditworthiness. Derivatives Financial contracts whose value is derived from changes in publicly traded securities, interest rates, currency exchange rates or market indices. Derivatives cover a wide assortment of financial contracts, including but not limited to forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Duration of equity An estimate of the rate sensitivity of our economic value of equity. A negative duration of equity is associated with asset sensitivity (i.e., positioned for rising interest rates), while a positive value implies liability sensitivity (i.e., positioned for declining interest rates). For example, if the duration of equity is +1.5 years, the economic value of equity declines by 1.5% for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates. Earning assets Assets that generate income, which include: Federal funds sold; resale agreements; trading securities; interest earning deposits with banks; loans held for sale; loans; investment securities; and certain other assets. Economic capital Represents the amount of resources that a business or business segment should hold to guard against potentially large losses that could cause insolvency and is based on a measurement of economic risk. The economic capital measurement process involves converting a risk distribution to the capital that is required to support the risk, consistent with our target credit rating. As such, economic risk serves as a common currency of risk that allows us to compare different risks on a similar basis. Effective duration A measurement, expressed in years, that, when multiplied by a change in interest rates, would approximate the percentage change in value of on and off balance sheet positions. Efficiency Noninterest expense divided by total revenue. Fair value The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FICO score A credit bureau based industry standard score created by Fair Isaac Co. which predicts the likelihood of borrower default. We use FICO scores both in underwriting and assessing credit risk in our consumer lending portfolio. Lower FICO scores indicate likely higher risk of default, while higher FICO scores indicate likely lower risk of default. FICO scores are updated on a periodic basis. Foreign exchange contracts Contracts that provide for the future receipt and delivery of foreign currency at previously agreed upon terms. Funds transfer pricing A management accounting methodology designed to recognize the net interest income effects of sources and uses of funds provided by the assets and liabilities of a business segment. We assign these balances LIBOR based funding rates at origination that represent the interest cost for us to raise/invest funds with similar maturity and repricing structures. Futures and forward contracts Contracts in which the buyer agrees to purchase and the seller agrees to deliver a specific financial instrument at a predetermined price or yield. May be settled either in cash or by delivery of the underlying financial instrument. GAAP Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Home Price Index (HPI) A broad measure of the movement of single family house prices in the U.S. Interest rate floors and caps Interest rate protection instruments that involve payment from the protection seller to the protection buyer of an interest differential, which represents the difference between a short term rate (e.g., three month LIBOR) and an agreed upon rate (the strike rate) applied to a notional principal amount. Interest rate swap contracts Contracts that are entered into primarily as an asset/liability management strategy to reduce interest rate risk. Interest rate swap contracts are exchanges of interest rate payments, such as fixed rate payments for floating rate payments, based on notional principal amounts. Intrinsic value The difference between the price, if any, required to be paid for stock issued pursuant to an equity compensation arrangement and the fair market value of the underlying stock. Investment securities Collectively, securities available for sale and securities held to maturity. Leverage ratio Tier 1 risk based capital divided by adjusted average total assets. LIBOR Acronym for London InterBank Offered Rate. LIBOR is the average interest rate charged when banks in the London wholesale money market (or interbank market) borrow unsecured funds from each other. LIBOR rates are used as a benchmark for interest rates on a global basis. PNCs product set includes loans priced using LIBOR as a benchmark. Loan to value ratio (LTV) A calculation of a loans collateral coverage that is used both in underwriting and assessing credit risk in our lending portfolio. LTV is the sum total of loan obligations secured by collateral divided by the 96 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents market value of that same collateral. Market values of the collateral are based on an independent valuation of the collateral. For example, an LTV of less than 90% is better secured and has less credit risk than an LTV of greater than or equal to 90%. Loss Given Default (LGD) An estimate of recovery based on collateral type, collateral value, loan exposure, or the guarantor(s) quality and guaranty type (full or partial). Each loan has its own LGD. The LGD risk rating measures the percentage of exposure of a specific credit obligation that we expect to lose if default occurs. LGD is net of recovery, through either liquidation of collateral or deficiency judgments rendered from foreclosure or bankruptcy proceedings. Net interest margin Annualized taxable equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets. Nonaccretable difference Contractually required payments receivable on a purchased impaired loan in excess of the cash flows expected to be collected. Nondiscretionary assets under administration Assets we hold for our customers/clients in a non discretionary, custodial capacity. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Nonperforming assets Nonperforming assets include non accrual loans, certain non accrual troubled debt restructured loans, OREO, foreclosed and other assets. We do not accrue interest income on assets classified as nonperforming. Nonperforming loans Loans for which we do not accrue interest income. Nonperforming loans include loans to commercial, commercial real estate, equipment lease financing, consumer (including loans and lines of credit secured by residential real estate), and residential real estate (including mortgages and construction) customers as well as certain non accrual troubled debt restructured loans. Nonperforming loans do not include loans held for sale or OREO and foreclosed assets. Nonperforming loans do not include purchased impaired loans as we are currently accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans. Notional amount A number of currency units, shares, or other units specified in a derivative contract. Operating leverage The period to period dollar or percentage change in total revenue (GAAP basis) less the dollar or percentage change in noninterest expense. A positive variance indicates that revenue growth exceeded expense growth (i.e., positive operating leverage) while a negative variance implies expense growth exceeded revenue growth (i.e., negative operating leverage). Options Contracts that grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right, but not the obligation, to either purchase or sell the associated financial instrument at a set price during a specified period or at a specified date in the future. Other real estate owned (OREO) and foreclosed assets Assets taken in settlement of troubled loans through surrender or foreclosure. Foreclosed assets include all assets received in full or partial satisfaction of a loan and include real and personal property, equity interests in corporations, partnerships, joint ventures, and beneficial interests in trusts. Premises that are no longer used in operations may also be included in other real estate owned. Other than temporary impairment (OTTI) When the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost basis, an assessment is performed to determine whether the impairment is other than temporary. If we intend to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss, an other than temporary impairment is considered to have occurred. In such cases, an other than temporary impairment is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investments amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. Further, if we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security, an other than temporary impairment is considered to have occurred. However for debt securities, if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its recovery, the other than temporary loss is separated into (a) the amount representing the credit loss, and (b) the amount related to all other factors. The other than temporary impairment related to credit losses is recognized in earnings while the amount related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax. Parent company liquidity coverage Liquid assets divided by funding obligations within a two year period. Pretax earnings Income from continuing operations before income taxes and noncontrolling interests. Pretax, pre provision earnings from continuing operations Total revenue less noninterest expense, both from continuing operations. Primary client relationship A corporate banking client relationship with annual revenue generation of $10,000 to $50,000 or more, and for Asset Management Group, a client relationship with annual revenue generation of $10,000 or more. Probability of Default (PD) An internal risk rating that indicates the likelihood that a credit obligor will enter into default status. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K 97 Table of Contents Purchase accounting accretion Accretion of the discounts and premiums on acquired assets and liabilities. The purchase accounting accretion is recognized in net interest income over the weighted average life of the financial instruments using the constant effective yield method. Accretion for Purchased impaired loans includes any cash recoveries received in excess of the recorded investment. Purchased impaired loans Acquired loans determined to be credit impaired under FASB ASC 310 30 (AICPA SOP 03 3). Loans are determined to be impaired if there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected. Recorded investment The initial investment of a purchased impaired loan plus interest accretion and less any cash payments and writedowns to date. The recorded investment excludes any valuation allowance which is included in our allowance for loan and lease losses. Recovery Cash proceeds received on a loan that we had previously charged off. We credit the amount received to the allowance for loan and lease losses. Residential development loans Project specific loans to commercial customers for the construction or development of residential real estate including land, single family homes, condominiums and other residential properties. This would exclude loans to commercial customers where proceeds are for general corporate purposes whether or not such facilities are secured. Residential mortgage servicing rights hedge gains/(losses), net We have elected to measure acquired or originated residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) at fair value under GAAP. We employ a risk management strategy designed to protect the economic value of MSRs from changes in interest rates. This strategy utilizes securities and a portfolio of derivative instruments to hedge changes in the fair value of MSRs arising from changes in interest rates. These financial instruments are expected to have changes in fair value which are negatively correlated to the change in fair value of the MSR portfolio. Net MSR hedge gains/(losses) represent the change in the fair value of MSRs, exclusive of changes due to time decay and payoffs, combined with the change in the fair value of the associated securities and derivative instruments. Return on average assets Annualized net income divided by average assets. Return on average capital Annualized net income divided by average capital. Return on average common shareholders equity Annualized net income less preferred stock dividends, including preferred stock discount accretion and redemptions, divided by average common shareholders equity. Risk weighted assets Computed by the assignment of specific risk weights (as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) to assets and off balance sheet instruments. Securitization The process of legally transforming financial assets into securities. Servicing rights An intangible asset or liability created by an obligation to service assets for others. Typical servicing rights include the right to receive a fee for collecting and forwarding payments on loans and related taxes and insurance premiums held in escrow. Swaptions Contracts that grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right, but not the obligation, to enter into an interest rate swap agreement during a specified period or at a specified date in the future. Taxable equivalent interest The interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from Federal income tax. As such, these tax exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and margins for all interest earning assets, we use interest income on a taxable equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income earned on tax exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on other taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income Statement. Tier 1 common capital Tier 1 risk based capital, less preferred equity, less trust preferred capital securities, and less noncontrolling interests. Tier 1 common capital ratio Tier 1 common capital divided by period end risk weighted assets. Tier 1 risk based capital Total shareholders equity, plus trust preferred capital securities, plus certain noncontrolling interests that are held by others; less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (net of eligible deferred taxes relating to taxable and nontaxable combinations), less equity investments in nonfinancial companies less ineligible servicing assets and less net unrealized holding losses on available for sale equity securities. Net unrealized holding gains on available for sale equity securities, net unrealized holding gains (losses) on available for sale debt securities and net unrealized holding gains (losses) on cash flow hedge derivatives are excluded from total shareholders equity for Tier 1 risk based capital purposes. Tier 1 risk based capital ratio Tier 1 risk based capital divided by period end risk weighted assets. Total equity Total shareholders equity plus noncontrolling interests. 98 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents Total return swap A non traditional swap where one party agrees to pay the other the total return of a defined underlying asset (e.g., a loan), usually in return for receiving a stream of LIBOR based cash flows. The total returns of the asset, including interest and any default shortfall, are passed through to the counterparty. The counterparty is therefore assuming the credit and economic risk of the underlying asset. Total risk based capital Tier 1 risk based capital plus qualifying subordinated debt and trust preferred securities, other noncontrolling interest not qualified as Tier 1, eligible gains on available for sale equity securities and the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to certain limitations. Total risk based capital ratio Total risk based capital divided by period end risk weighted assets. Transaction deposits The sum of interest bearing money market deposits, interest bearing demand deposits, and noninterest bearing deposits. Troubled debt restructuring (TDR) A loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Value at risk (VaR) A statistically based measure of risk that describes the amount of potential loss which may be incurred due to severe and adverse market movements. The measure is of the maximum loss which should not be exceeded on 95 out of 100 days for a 95% VaR and 99 out of 100 days for a 99% VaR. Watchlist A list of criticized loans, credit exposure or other assets compiled for internal monitoring purposes. We define criticized exposure for this purpose as exposure with an internal risk rating of other assets especially mentioned, substandard, doubtful or loss. Yield curve A graph showing the relationship between the yields on financial instruments or market indices of the same credit quality with different maturities. For example, a normal or positive yield curve exists when long term bonds have higher yields than short term bonds. A flat yield curve exists when yields are the same for short term and long term bonds. A steep yield curve exists when yields on long term bonds are significantly higher than on short term bonds. An inverted or negative yield curve exists when short term bonds have higher yields than long term bonds. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION We make statements in this Report, and may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook for earnings, revenues, expenses, capital levels and ratios, liquidity levels, asset levels, asset quality and other matters regarding or affecting PNC and its future business and operations that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward looking statements are typically identified by words such as believe, plan, expect, anticipate, see, look, intend, outlook, project, forecast, estimate, goal, will, should and other similar words and expressions. Forward looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Forward looking statements speak only as of the date made. We do not assume any duty and do not undertake to update forward looking statements. Actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in forward looking statements, as well as from historical performance. Our forward looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties. Our businesses, financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business and economic conditions, including the following: Changes in interest rates and valuations in debt, equity and other financial markets. Disruptions in the liquidity and other functioning of U.S. and global financial markets. The impact on financial markets and the economy of the downgrade by Standard & Poors of U.S. Treasury obligations and other U.S. government backed debt, as well as issues surrounding the level of U.S. and European government debt and concerns regarding the creditworthiness of certain sovereign governments in Europe. Actions by Federal Reserve, U.S. Treasury and other government agencies, including those that impact money supply and market interest rates. Changes in customers, suppliers and other counterparties performance and creditworthiness. Slowing or failure of the current moderate economic recovery. Continued effects of aftermath of recessionary conditions and uneven spread of positive impacts of recovery on the economy and our counterparties, including adverse impacts on levels of unemployment, loan utilization rates, delinquencies, defaults and counterparty ability to meet credit and other obligations. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K 99 Table of Contents Changes in customer preferences and behavior, whether due to changing business and economic conditions, legislative and regulatory initiatives, or other factors. Our forward looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than we are currently expecting. These statements are based on our current view that the modest economic expansion will persist in 2012 and interest rates will remain very low. Legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, reputation, or pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities. Reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding, and ability to attract and retain management. These developments could include: Changes resulting from legislative and regulatory reforms, including broad based restructuring of financial industry regulation and changes to laws and regulations involving tax, pension, bankruptcy, consumer protection, and other industry aspects, and changes in accounting policies and principles. We will be impacted by extensive reforms provided for in the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and otherwise growing out of the recent financial crisis, the precise nature, extent and timing of which, and their impact on us, remains uncertain. Changes to regulations governing bank capital and liquidity standards, including due to the Dodd Frank Act and to Basel III initiatives. Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or other inquiries. In addition to matters relating to PNCs business and activities, such matters may include proceedings, claims, investigations, or inquiries relating to pre acquisition business and activities of acquired companies, such as National City. These matters may result in monetary judgments or settlements or other remedies, including fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs, and may cause reputational harm to PNC. Results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements of agreements with governmental agencies. Impact on business and operating results of any costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of adequacy of our intellectual property protection in general. Business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through effective use of third party insurance, derivatives, and capital management techniques, and to meet evolving regulatory capital standards. In particular, our results currently depend on our ability to manage elevated levels of impaired assets. Business and operating results also include impacts relating to our equity interest in BlackRock, Inc. and rely to a significant extent on information provided to us by BlackRock. Risks and uncertainties that could affect BlackRock are discussed in more detail by BlackRock in its SEC filings. Our planned acquisition of RBC Bank (USA) presents us with risks and uncertainties related both to the acquisition transaction itself and its integration into PNC after closing, including: The transaction (including integration of RBC Bank (USA)s businesses) may be substantially more expensive to complete than anticipated. Anticipated benefits, including cost savings and strategic gains, may be significantly harder or take longer to achieve than expected or may not be achieved in their entirety as a result of unexpected factors or events. Our ability to achieve anticipated results from this transaction is dependent also on the extent of credit losses in the acquired loan portfolios and the extent of deposit attrition, in part related to the state of economic and financial markets. Also, litigation and governmental investigations that may be filed or commenced, as a result of this transaction or otherwise, could impact the timing or realization of anticipated benefits to PNC. Integration of RBC Bank (USA)s business and operations into PNC, which will include conversion of RBC Bank (USA)s different systems and procedures, may take longer than anticipated or be more costly than anticipated or have unanticipated adverse results relating to RBC Bank (USA)s or PNCs existing businesses. PNCs ability to integrate RBC Bank (USA) successfully may be adversely affected by the facts that this transaction will result in PNC entering several markets where PNC does not currently have any meaningful retail presence and that the conversion is taking place simultaneously with the acquisition. In addition to the planned RBC Bank (USA) transaction, we grow our business in part by acquiring from time to time other financial services companies, financial services assets and related deposits and other liabilities. These other acquisitions often present risks and uncertainties analogous to those presented by the RBC Bank (USA) transaction. Acquisition risks include those presented by the nature of the business acquired as well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, regulatory issues, and the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing. Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention and on credit spreads and product 100 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents pricing, which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. Industry restructuring in the current environment could also impact our business and financial performance through changes in counterparty creditworthiness and performance and in the competitive and regulatory landscape. Our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands. Business and operating results can also be affected by widespread disasters, dislocations, terrorist activities or international hostilities through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties specifically. We provide greater detail regarding some of these factors elsewhere in this Report, including in the Risk Factors and Risk Management sections. Our forward looking statements may also be subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those discussed elsewhere in this Report or in our other filings with the SEC. ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK This information is set forth in the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report.
