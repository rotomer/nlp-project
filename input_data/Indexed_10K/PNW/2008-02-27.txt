ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Pinnacle Wests Consolidated Financial Statements and APS Financial Statements and the related Notes that appear in Item 8 of this report. OVERVIEW Pinnacle West owns all of the outstanding common stock of APS. APS is a vertically integrated electric utility that provides retail and wholesale electric service to most of the state of Arizona, with the major exceptions of about one half of the Phoenix metropolitan area, the Tucson metropolitan area and Mohave County in northwestern Arizona. APS has historically accounted for a substantial part of our revenues and earnings, and is expected to continue to do so. Customer growth in APS service territory is above the national average and remains an important driver of our revenues and earnings. Our cash flows and profitability are affected by the rates APS may charge and the timely recovery of costs through those rates. APS retail rates are regulated by the ACC and its wholesale electric rates (primarily for transmission) are regulated by the FERC. APS capital expenditure requirements, which are discussed below under Liquidity and Capital Resources, are substantial because of customer growth in APS service territory and inflationary impacts on the capital budget, highlighting APS need for the timely recovery through rates of these and other expenditures. On June 28, 2007, the ACC issued an order in a general rate case granting APS retail base rate increases. The ACC rate case decision and other retail and wholesale rate matters are discussed in Note 3. SunCor, our real estate development subsidiary, has been an important source of earnings in recent years, although SunCors earnings in 2007 and expected earnings in 2008 reflect a slowdown in the western United States real estate markets. See discussion below in Pinnacle West Consolidated Factors Affecting our Financial Outlook Subsidiaries. Our subsidiary, APSES, provides energy related products and services and competitive commodity related energy services to commercial and industrial retail customers in the western United States. Recently, APSES has de emphasized its commodity related energy services. El Dorado, our investment subsidiary, owns minority interests in several energy related investments and Arizona community based ventures. We continue to focus on solid operational performance in our electricity generation and delivery activities. In the delivery area, we focus on superior reliability and customer satisfaction. We plan to expand long term energy resources and our transmission and distribution systems to meet the electricity needs of our growing retail customers and sustain reliability. See Pinnacle West Consolidated Factors Affecting Our Financial Outlook below for a discussion of several factors that could affect our future financial results. 39 Table of Contents PINNACLE WEST CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS CONTRIBUTION BY BUSINESS SEGMENT Pinnacle Wests two reportable business segments are: our regulated electricity segment, which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses (primarily electric service to Native Load customers) and related activities and includes electricity generation, transmission and distribution; and our real estate segment, which consists of SunCors real estate development and investment activities. The following table summarizes income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 and reconciles net income in total (dollars in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Regulated electricity segment (a) $ 274 $ 259 $ 167 Real estate segment 12 50 35 All other (b) 13 8 21 Income from continuing operations 299 317 223 Discontinued operations net of tax: Real estate (c) 11 10 17 Sale of Silverhawk (d) 1 (67 ) All other (b) (3 ) (1 ) 3 Net income $ 307 $ 327 $ 176 (a) Includes an $84 million after tax regulatory disallowance of plant costs in 2005 in accordance with APS 2003 general retail rate case settlement. (b) Includes activities related to marketing and trading, APSES and El Dorado. None of these segments is a reportable segment. (c) Primarily relates to sales of commercial properties. (d) See Note 22. PINNACLE WEST CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2007 Compared with 2006 Our consolidated net income for 2007 was $307 million compared with $327 million for 2006. The current period includes income from discontinued operations of $11 million related to sales of commercial properties by SunCor and a loss from discontinued operations of $3 million related to an APSES project. The prior year includes income from discontinued operations of $10 million related to sales of commercial properties by SunCor. Income from continuing operations decreased $18 million in the year to year comparison and is reflected in the segments as follows: 40 Table of Contents Regulated Electricity Segment Income from continuing operations increased approximately $15 million primarily due to higher retail sales related to customer growth; the effects of weather on retail sales; and impacts of the retail rate increase. These positive factors were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense primarily due to increased generation costs (including increased maintenance and overhauls and the Palo Verde performance improvement plan), customer service and other costs; higher depreciation and amortization primarily due to increased plant balances; lower other income, net of expense, primarily due to miscellaneous asset sales in the prior year and lower interest income as a result of lower investment balances; and a regulatory disallowance. In addition, higher fuel and purchased power costs related to commodity price increases were substantially offset by deferral of such costs in accordance with the PSA. See Note 3 for further discussion of the regulatory disallowance and the PSA. Real Estate Segment Income from continuing operations decreased approximately $38 million primarily due to lower sales of residential property and land parcels resulting from the continued slowdown in the western United States real estate markets. 41 Table of Contents Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with the prior year are contained in the following table (dollars in millions): Increase (Decrease) Pretax After Tax Regulated electricity segment: Higher retail sales primarily due to customer growth, excluding weather effects $ 46 $ 28 Effects of weather on retail sales 37 23 Impacts of retail rate increase effective July 1, 2007: Revenue increase related to higher Base Fuel Rate 185 113 Decreased deferred fuel and purchased power costs related to higher Base Fuel Rate (171 ) (104 ) Non fuel rate increase 6 4 Net changes in fuel and purchased power costs related to price: Higher fuel and purchased power costs related to increased commodity prices (121 ) (74 ) Increased deferred fuel and purchased power costs related to increased prices 115 70 Mark to market fuel and purchased power costs, net of related deferred fuel and purchased power costs 18 11 Regulatory disallowance (see Note 3) (14 ) (8 ) Operations and maintenance increases primarily due to: Increased generation costs, including increased maintenance and overhauls and Palo Verde performance improvement plan (25 ) (15 ) Customer service and other costs (21 ) (13 ) Higher depreciation and amortization primarily due to increased plant balances (12 ) (7 ) Lower other income, net of expense, primarily due to lower interest income as a result of lower investment balances and miscellaneous asset sales in prior year (15 ) (9 ) Income tax benefits resolved in 2007 related to prior years 13 Income tax credits resolved in 2006 related to prior years (14 ) Miscellaneous items, net 6 (3 ) Increase in regulated electricity segment net income 34 15 Lower real estate segment income from continuing operations primarily due to: Lower sales of residential property resulting from the continued slowdown in the western United States real estate markets (47 ) (29 ) Lower sales of land parcels (12 ) (7 ) Higher other costs (5 ) (2 ) Higher marketing and trading contribution primarily due to higher mark to market gains resulting from changes in forward prices and higher unit margins 8 5 Other miscellaneous items, net (2 ) Decrease in income from continuing operations $ (24 ) (18 ) Discontinued operations: Increased commercial property real estate sales 1 Other discontinued operations (3 ) Decrease in net income $ (20 ) 42 Table of Contents Regulated Electricity Segment Revenues Regulated electricity segment revenues were $283 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with the prior year primarily because of: a $191 million increase in retail revenues due to a rate increase effective July 1, 2007; a $60 million increase in retail revenues primarily related to customer growth, excluding weather effects; a $50 million increase in retail revenues due to the effects of weather; a $3 million increase in revenues from Off System Sales due to higher prices and volumes; a $35 million decrease in retail revenues related to recovery of PSA deferrals, which had no earnings effect because of amortization of the same amount recorded as fuel and purchased power expense (see Note 3); and a $14 million net increase due to miscellaneous factors. Real Estate Segment Revenues Real estate segment revenues were $185 million lower for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with the prior year primarily because of: a $167 million decrease in residential property sales due to the continued slowdown in western United States real estate markets; and an $18 million decrease primarily due to lower sales of land parcels. All Other Revenues Marketing and trading revenues were $12 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with the prior year primarily because of higher mark to market gains resulting from changes in forward prices and higher competitive retail sales volumes in California. Other revenues were $12 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with the prior year primarily as a result of increased sales by APSES of energy related products and services. 2006 Compared with 2005 Our consolidated net income for 2006 was $327 million compared with $176 million for the comparable prior year period. The prior year included a net loss from discontinued operations of $47 million, which was related to the sale and operations of Silverhawk, partially offset by income from sales of real estate commercial properties at SunCor. Income from continuing operations increased $94 million in the period to period comparison, reflecting the following changes in earnings by segment: 43 Table of Contents Regulated Electricity Segment Income from continuing operations increased approximately $92 million primarily due to an $84 million after tax regulatory disallowance of plant costs recorded in 2005. Income also increased due to higher retail sales volumes due to customer growth; income tax credits related to prior years resolved in 2006; and increased other income due to higher interest income on higher investment balances. These positive factors were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense related to generation and customer service; and higher depreciation and amortization primarily due to increased plant asset balances, partially offset by lower depreciation rates. In addition, higher fuel and purchased power costs of $74 million after tax were partially offset by the deferral of $45 million after tax of costs in accordance with the PSA. Real Estate Segment Income from continuing operations increased approximately $15 million primarily due to increased margins on residential sales and the sale of certain joint venture assets, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses. Income from discontinued operations decreased $7 million due to lower commercial property sales. Other Income from continuing operations decreased approximately $13 million primarily due to lower mark to market gains, partially offset by higher unit margins on wholesale sales and competitive retail sales in California. 44 Table of Contents Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the prior year are contained in the following table (dollars in millions): Increase (Decrease) Pretax After Tax Regulated electricity segment: Higher fuel and purchased power costs $ (121 ) $ (74 ) Increased deferred fuel and purchased power costs (deferrals began April 1, 2005) 73 45 Higher retail sales volumes due to customer growth, excluding weather effects 87 53 Regulatory disallowance of plant costs in 2005, in accordance with APS 2003 general retail rate case settlement 139 84 Operations and maintenance increases primarily due to: Generation costs, including increased maintenance and overhauls (41 ) (25 ) Customer service costs, including regulatory demand side management programs and planned maintenance (16 ) (10 ) Miscellaneous items, net 3 2 Higher depreciation and amortization primarily due to increased plant asset balances partially offset by lower depreciation rates (11 ) (7 ) Higher other income, net of expense, primarily due to miscellaneous asset sales and increased interest income on higher investment balances 13 8 Income tax credits related to prior years resolved in 2006 14 Miscellaneous items, net (4 ) 2 Increase in regulated electricity segment net income 122 92 Lower marketing and trading contribution primarily related to lower mark to market gains, partially offset by higher unit margins on wholesale sales and competitive retail sales in California (18 ) (11 ) Higher real estate segment contribution primarily related to increased margins on residential sales and the sale of certain joint venture assets 25 15 Miscellaneous items, net (5 ) (2 ) Increase in income from continuing operations $ 124 94 Discontinued operations: Silverhawk loss in 2005 68 Lower commercial property real estate sales (7 ) Income in 2005 related to sale of NAC (4 ) Increase in net income $ 151 Regulated Electricity Segment Revenues Regulated electricity segment revenues were $398 million higher for 2006 compared with the prior year period primarily as a result of: a $265 million increase in revenues related to recovery of PSA deferrals, which had no earnings effect because of amortization of the same amount recorded as fuel and purchased power expense; 45 Table of Contents a $124 million increase in retail revenues related to customer growth, excluding weather effects; a $6 million increase in Off System Sales primarily resulting from $12 million of sales previously reported in marketing and trading that were classified beginning in April 2005 as sales in the regulated electricity segment in accordance with APS 2003 general retail rate case settlement, partially offset by $6 million of lower Off System Sales in 2006; and a $3 million increase due to miscellaneous factors. Real Estate Segment Revenues Real estate segment revenues were $62 million higher for 2006 compared with the prior year period primarily as a result of: a $55 million increase in residential sales due to higher prices and volumes; and a $7 million increase in commercial real estate sales. Other Revenues Other revenues were $25 million lower for 2006 compared with the prior year period primarily as a result of decreased sales related products and services by APSES. Marketing and trading revenues were $21 million lower for 2006 compared with the prior year period primarily as a result of: a $20 million decrease in mark to market gains on contracts for future delivery due to changes in forward prices; a $12 million decrease in Off System Sales due to the absence of sales previously reported in marketing and trading that were classified beginning in April 2005 as sales in the regulated electricity segment in accordance with APS 2003 general retail rate case settlement; a $23 million increase from higher prices on competitive retail sales in California; and a $12 million decrease due to miscellaneous factors. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Pinnacle West Consolidated Operating Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $658 million for 2007, compared with $394 million for 2006, an increase in net cash flow of $264 million. This change was primarily due to a decrease in 2007 in the amount of cash collateral and margin cash returned to counterparties as a result of changes in commodity prices. 46 Table of Contents Net cash provided by operating activities was $394 million for 2006, compared with $730 million for 2005, a decrease in net cash flow of $336 million. This change was primarily due to an increase in 2006 in the amount of cash collateral and margin cash returned to counterparties as a result of changes in commodity prices. Investing Cash Flows Net cash used for investing activities was $873 million for 2007, compared with $569 million for 2006, a decrease in net cash flow of $304 million. This cash flow decrease was primarily due to: A decrease in cash provided by investing activities related to proceeds of $208 million received in 2006 from the sale of Silverhawk; and An increase in cash used for capital expenditures and capitalized interest of $183 million (see table and discussion below). The cash flow decreases were partially offset by: A decrease of $65 million in cash invested in securities at APS; An increase of $19 million cash provided by sale of real estate investments; and A net increase of $3 million due to miscellaneous factors. Net cash used for investing activities was $569 million for 2006, compared with $585 million for 2005, an increase in net cash flow of $16 million. This cash flow increase was primarily due to: Proceeds of $208 million received in 2006 from the sale of Silverhawk; and Less cash used for capital expenditures (including the 2005 acquisition of the Sundance Plant) and capitalized interest of approximately $72 million (see table and discussion below). The cash flow increases were partially offset by: An increase of $214 million in cash invested in securities at APS; A decrease of $43 million in cash provided by sale of real estate investments; and 47 Table of Contents A net decrease of $7 million due to miscellaneous factors. Financing Cash Flows Net cash provided by financing activities was $185 million for 2007, compared with $108 million for 2006, an increase in net cash flow of $77 million. This cash flow increase was primarily due to a net increase of $295 million in short term borrowings to fund day to day operations and liquidity needs. The cash flow increases were partially offset by: A decrease of $161 million in net new long term debt (issuances net of redemptions and refinancing) to fund our construction program and for other general corporate purposes; and A net decrease of $57 million due to miscellaneous factors. Net cash provided by financing activities was $108 million for 2006, compared with net cash used for financing activities in 2005 of $155 million, an increase in net cash flow of $263 million. This cash flow increase was primarily due to: An increase of $429 million in net new long term debt (issuances net of redemptions and refinancing) to fund our construction program and for other general corporate purposes; A net increase of $56 million in short term borrowings to fund day to day operations and liquidity needs; and A net increase of $37 million due to miscellaneous factors. The cash flow increases were partially offset by: A decrease of $259 million related to common stock issuance, primarily due to a 2005 public offering. Liquidity Capital Expenditure Requirements The following table summarizes the actual capital expenditures for 2005, 2006 and 2007 and estimated capital expenditures for the next three years: 48 Table of Contents CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (dollars in millions) Actual Estimated 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 APS Distribution $ 325 $ 357 $ 372 $ 410 $ 440 $ 430 Generation (a) 356 176 353 380 390 380 Transmission 92 113 138 220 320 290 Other (b) 36 16 37 50 40 50 Subtotal 809 662 900 1,060 1,190 1,150 SunCor (c) 106 201 161 100 90 100 Other 13 7 3 20 20 10 Total $ 928 $ 870 $ 1,064 $ 1,180 $ 1,300 $ 1,260 (a) Includes $185 million in 2005 for the acquisition of the Sundance Plant. (b) Primarily information systems and facilities projects. (c) Consists primarily of capital expenditures for residential, land development and retail and office building construction reflected in Real estate investments and Capital expenditures on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Distribution and transmission capital expenditures are comprised of infrastructure additions and upgrades, capital replacements, new customer construction and related information systems and facility costs. Examples of the types of projects included in the forecast include power lines, substations, line extensions to new residential and commercial developments and upgrades to customer information systems. In addition, these amounts do not include any impacts from the recent changes in the line extension policy (see Note 3). Major transmission projects are driven by regional customer growth. Generation capital expenditures are comprised of various improvements to APS existing fossil and nuclear plants. Examples of the types of projects included in this category are additions, upgrades and capital replacements of various power plant equipment such as turbines, boilers and environmental equipment. Installation of new steam generators in Palo Verde Unit 3 was completed in the fourth quarter of 2007 at an approximate cost of $70 million (APS share), which completed the steam generator replacement program for all three units. Environmental expenditures are estimated at approximately $70 million to $120 million per year for 2008, 2009 and 2010. We are also monitoring the status of certain environmental matters, which, depending on their final outcome, could require additional environmental expenditures. (See Business of Arizona Public Service Company Environmental Matters Regional Haze Rules in Item 1.) Generation also includes nuclear fuel expenditures of approximately $90 million to $120 million per year for 2008, 2009 and 2010. Capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash and or external financings, which may include issuances of long term debt and Pinnacle West common stock. 49 Table of Contents Pinnacle West (Parent Company) Our primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest payments on our long term debt. The level of our common stock dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on a number of factors including, but not limited to, payout ratio trends, free cash flow and financial market conditions. On January 23, 2008, the Pinnacle West Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.525 per share of common stock, payable on March 3, 2008, to shareholders of record on February 1, 2008. Our primary sources of cash are dividends from APS, external debt and equity financings and cash distributions from our other subsidiaries, primarily SunCor. For the years 2005 through 2007, total dividends from APS were $510 million and total distributions from SunCor were $70 million. For 2007, cash contributions from APS were $170 million and distributions from SunCor were $10 million. An existing ACC order requires APS to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40% and prohibits APS from paying common stock dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold. As defined in the ACC order, the common equity ratio is common equity divided by the sum of common equity and long term debt, including current maturities of long term debt. At December 31, 2007, APS common equity ratio, as defined, was approximately 54%. At December 31, 2007, Pinnacle Wests outstanding long term debt, including current maturities, was $175 million. Pinnacle West has a $300 million revolving credit facility that terminates in December 2010. This line of credit is available to support the issuance of up to $250 million in commercial paper or to be used as bank borrowings, including issuances of letters of credit. At December 31, 2007, Pinnacle West had no borrowings outstanding under its revolving line of credit. At December 31, 2007, we had $115 million of commercial paper outstanding. Pinnacle West sponsors a qualified defined benefit and account balance pension plan and a non qualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for the employees of Pinnacle West and our subsidiaries. IRS regulations require us to contribute a minimum amount to the qualified plan. We contribute at least the minimum amount required under IRS regulations, but no more than the maximum tax deductible amount. The minimum required funding takes into consideration the value of plan assets and our pension obligation. The assets in the plan are comprised of fixed income, equity and short term investments. Future year contribution amounts are dependent on plan asset performance and plan actuarial assumptions. We contributed approximately $52 million in 2007. The contribution to our pension plan in 2008 is estimated to be approximately $50 million. The expected contribution to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2008 is estimated to be approximately $20 million. APS and other subsidiaries fund their share of the contributions. APS share is approximately 96% of both plans. Significant Financing Activities 2007. On January 4, 2007, the FERC issued an order permitting Pinnacle West to transfer its market based rate tariff and wholesale power sales agreements to a newly created Pinnacle West subsidiary, Pinnacle West Marketing Trading. Pinnacle West completed the transfer on February 1, 2007, which resulted in Pinnacle West no longer being a public utility under the Federal Power Act. As a result, Pinnacle West is no longer subject to FERC jurisdiction in connection with its issuance of securities or its incurrence of long term debt. 50 Table of Contents In May 2007, Pinnacle West infused approximately $40 million of equity into APS, consisting of proceeds of stock issuances in 2006 under Pinnacle Wests Investors Advantage Plan (direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan) and employee stock plans. Significant Financing Activities 2006. In January 2006, Pinnacle West infused into APS $210 million of the proceeds from the sale of Silverhawk. On February 28, 2006, Pinnacle West entered into an Uncommitted Master Shelf Agreement with Prudential Investment Management, Inc. (Prudential) and certain of its affiliates. The agreement provides the terms under which Pinnacle West may offer up to $200 million of its senior notes for purchase by Prudential affiliates at any time prior to December 31, 2007. The maturity of notes issued under the agreement cannot exceed five years. Pursuant to the agreement, on February 28, 2006, Pinnacle West issued and sold to Prudential affiliates $175 million of its 5.91% Senior Notes, Series A, due February 28, 2011 (the Series A Notes). On April 3, 2006, Pinnacle West repaid $300 million of its 6.40% Senior Notes due April 2006. Pinnacle West used the proceeds of the Series A Notes, cash on hand and commercial paper proceeds to repay these notes. APS APS capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and optional and mandatory redemptions of long term debt. APS pays for its capital requirements with cash from operations, equity infusions from Pinnacle West and, to the extent necessary, external financings. APS has historically paid its dividends to Pinnacle West with cash from operations. See Pinnacle West (Parent Company) above for a discussion of the common equity ratio that APS must maintain in order to pay dividends to Pinnacle West. As noted above, in May 2007, Pinnacle West infused approximately $40 million of equity into APS. APS outstanding long term debt, including current maturities, was approximately $2.9 billion at December 31, 2007. APS has two committed lines of credit totaling $900 million that are available either to support the issuance of up to $250 million in commercial paper or to be used for bank borrowings, including issuances of letters of credit. The $400 million line terminates in December 2010 and the $500 million line terminates in September 2011. At December 31, 2007, APS had borrowings of $218 million under its revolving line of credit. The amount drawn was used for general corporate purposes. Significant Financing Activities 2007. Although provisions in APS articles of incorporation and ACC financing orders establish maximum amounts of preferred stock and debt that APS may issue, APS does not expect any of these provisions to limit its ability to meet its capital requirements. On October 30, 2007, the ACC issued a financing order in which it approved APS request, subject to specified parameters and procedures, to increase (a) APS short term debt authorization from 7% of APS capitalization to (i) 7% of APS capitalization plus (ii) $500 million and (b) APS long term debt authorization from approximately $3.2 billion to $4.2 billion in light of the projected growth of APS and its customer base and the resulting projected financing needs. Significant Financing Activities 2006. On August 3, 2006, APS issued $400 million of debt as follows: $250 million of its 6.25% Notes due 2016 and $150 million of its 6.875% Notes due 2036. A portion of the proceeds was used to pay at maturity approximately $84 million of APS 51 Table of Contents 6.75% Senior Notes due November 15, 2006. The remainder was used to fund its construction program and other general corporate purposes. On September 28, 2006, APS put in place the $500 million revolving credit facility that terminates in September 2011. APS may increase the amount of the facility up to a maximum facility of $600 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. APS will use the facility for general corporate purposes. The facility can also be used for the issuance of letters of credit. Interest rates are based on APS senior unsecured debt credit ratings. Other Financing Matters See Note 3 for information regarding the PSA approved by the ACC. Although APS defers actual retail fuel and purchased power costs on a current basis, APS recovery of the deferrals from its ratepayers is subject to annual and, if necessary, periodic PSA adjustments. See Cash Flow Hedges in Note 18 for information related to decreased collateral provided to us by counterparties and the change in our margin account. Other Subsidiaries During the past three years, SunCor funded its cash requirements with cash from operations and its own external financings. SunCors capital needs consist primarily of capital expenditures for land development and retail and office building construction. See the capital expenditures table above for actual capital expenditures during 2007 and projected capital expenditures for the next three years. SunCor expects to fund its future capital requirements with cash from operations and external financings. SunCor entered into a secured construction loan on April 13, 2007, in the amount of $60 million, of which $48 million was outstanding at December 31, 2007. The loan matures on April 19, 2009, and may be extended one year if certain conditions are met. On July 31, 2007, SunCor borrowed $12 million under a new secured construction loan. The loan matures on July 31, 2009, and may be extended annually up to two years. SunCors total outstanding debt was approximately $246 million as of December 31, 2007, including $94 million of debt classified as current maturities of long term debt under revolving lines of credit totaling $170 million. SunCors long term debt, including current maturities, was $238 million and total short term debt was $8 million at December 31, 2007. See Note 6. El Dorado expects minimal capital requirements over the next three years and intends to focus on prudently realizing the value of its existing investments. APSES expects minimal capital expenditures over the next three years. 52 Table of Contents Debt Provisions Pinnacle Wests and APS debt covenants related to their respective bank financing arrangements include debt to capitalization ratios. Certain of APS bank financing arrangements also include an interest coverage test. Pinnacle West and APS comply with these covenants and each anticipates it will continue to meet these and other significant covenant requirements. For both Pinnacle West and APS, these covenants require that the ratio of consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization not exceed 65%. At December 31, 2007, the ratio was approximately 50% for Pinnacle West and 47% for APS. The provisions regarding interest coverage require minimum cash coverage of two times the interest requirements for APS. The interest coverage was approximately 4.7 times under APS bank financing agreements as of December 31, 2007. Failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which, generally speaking, would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could cross default other debt. See further discussion of cross default provisions below. Neither Pinnacle Wests nor APS financing agreements contain rating triggers that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade. However, our bank financial agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest costs we pay are determined by our current credit ratings. All of Pinnacle Wests loan agreements contain cross default provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if Pinnacle West or APS were to default under certain other material agreements. All of APS bank agreements contain cross default provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank agreements if APS were to default under certain other material agreements. Pinnacle West and APS do not have a material adverse change restriction for revolver borrowings. See Note 6 for further discussions. Credit Ratings The ratings of securities of Pinnacle West and APS as of February 25, 2008 are shown below. The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies, from which an explanation of the significance of their ratings may be obtained. There is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant. Any downward revision or withdrawal may adversely affect the market price of Pinnacle Wests or APS securities and serve to increase the cost of and access to capital. It may also require additional collateral related to certain derivative instruments, natural gas transportation, fuel supply, and other energy related contracts. 53 Table of Contents Moodys Standard Poors Fitch Pinnacle West Senior unsecured (a) Baa3 (P) BB (prelim) N/A Commercial paper P 3 A 3 F3 Outlook Negative Stable Negative APS Senior unsecured Baa2 BBB BBB Secured lease obligation bonds Baa2 BBB BBB Commercial paper P 2 A 3 F3 Outlook Negative Stable Stable (a) Pinnacle West has a shelf registration under SEC Rule 415. Pinnacle West currently has no outstanding, rated senior unsecured securities. However, Moodys assigned a provisional (P) rating and Standard Poors assigned a preliminary (prelim) rating to the senior unsecured securities that can be issued under such shelf registration. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In 1986, APS entered into agreements with three separate VIE lessors in order to sell and lease back interests in Palo Verde Unit 2. The leases are accounted for as operating leases in accordance with GAAP. We are not the primary beneficiary of the Palo Verde VIEs and, accordingly, do not consolidate them (see Note 9). APS is exposed to losses under the Palo Verde sale leaseback agreements upon the occurrence of certain events that APS does not consider to be reasonably likely to occur. Under certain circumstances (for example, the NRC issuing specified violation orders with respect to Palo Verde or the occurrence of specified nuclear events), APS would be required to assume the debt associated with the transactions, make specified payments to the equity participants, and take title to the leased Unit 2 interests, which, if appropriate, may be required to be written down in value. If such an event had occurred as of December 31, 2007, APS would have been required to assume approximately $194 million of debt and pay the equity participants approximately $170 million. Guarantees and Letters of Credit We have issued parental guarantees and letters of credit and obtained surety bonds on behalf of our subsidiaries. Our parental guarantees for Pinnacle West Marketing Trading and APS relate to commodity energy products. Our credit support instruments enable APSES to offer energy related products and commodity energy. Non performance or non payment under the original contract by our subsidiaries would require us to perform under the guarantee or surety bond. No liability is currently recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to Pinnacle Wests current outstanding guarantees on behalf of our subsidiaries. Our guarantees have no recourse or collateral provisions to allow us to recover amounts paid under the guarantees. We generally agree to indemnification provisions related to liabilities arising from or related to certain of our agreements, with limited exceptions depending on the particular agreement. See Note 21 for additional information regarding guarantees and letters of credit. 54 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes Pinnacle Wests consolidated contractual requirements as of December 31, 2007 (dollars in millions): 2009 2011 2008 2010 2012 Thereafter Total Long term debt payments, including interest: (a) APS $ 158 $ 537 $ 1,038 $ 3,135 $ 4,868 SunCor 173 78 2 2 255 Pinnacle West 10 21 177 208 Total long term debt payments, including interest 341 636 1,217 3,137 5,331 Short term debt payments, including interest (b) 342 342 Purchased power and fuel commitments (c) 418 651 434 1,584 3,087 Operating lease payments 79 148 133 195 555 Nuclear decommissioning funding requirements 21 46 49 210 326 Purchase obligations (d) 99 29 2 91 221 Uncertain tax positions 203 12 215 Total contractual commitments $ 1,503 $ 1,522 $ 1,835 $ 5,217 $ 10,077 (a) The long term debt matures at various dates through 2036 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate long term debt is determined by using the rates at December 31, 2007 (see Note 6). (b) The short term debt is primarily related to APS bank borrowings under its revolving line of credit and commercial paper at Pinnacle West (see Note 5). (c) Our purchased power and fuel commitments include purchases of coal, electricity, natural gas and nuclear fuel (see Note 11). (d) These contractual obligations include commitments for capital expenditures and other obligations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES In preparing the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties, judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved. 55 Table of Contents Regulatory Accounting Regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators, such as the ACC and the FERC, to be reflected in our financial statements. Their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings. A major component of our regulatory assets is the retail fuel and power costs deferred under the PSA. APS defers for future rate recovery 90% of the difference between actual retail fuel and power costs and the amount of such costs currently included in base rates. We had $625 million, including $111 million related to the PSA, of regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2007. Also included in the balance of regulatory assets at December 31, 2007 is a regulatory asset of $338 million in accordance with SFAS No. 158 for pension and other postretirement benefits. This regulatory asset represents the future recovery of these costs through retail rates as these amounts are charged to earnings. If these costs are disallowed by the ACC, this regulatory asset would be charged to OCI and result in lower future earnings. In addition, we had $643 million of regulatory liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2007, which primarily are related to removal costs. See Notes 1 and 3 for more information. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefit Accounting Changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position. The most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the long term, and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates. We review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary. The following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the December 31, 2007 reported pension liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and our 2007 reported pension expense, after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants, on Pinnacle Wests Consolidated Statements of Income (dollars in millions): 56 Table of Contents Increase (Decrease) Impact on Impact on Pension Pension Actuarial Assumption (a) Liability Expense Discount rate: Increase 1% $ (213 ) $ (5 ) Decrease 1% 243 9 Expected long term rate of return on plan assets: Increase 1% (6 ) Decrease 1% 6 (a) Each fluctuation assumes that the other assumptions of the calculation are held constant while the rates are changed by one percentage point. The following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the December 31, 2007 reported other postretirement benefit obligation on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and our 2007 reported other postretirement benefit expense, after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants, on Pinnacle Wests Consolidated Statements of Income (dollars in millions): Increase (Decrease) Impact on Other Impact on Other Postretirement Benefit Postretirement Actuarial Assumption (a) Obligation Benefit Expense Discount rate: Increase 1% $ (90 ) $ (4 ) Decrease 1% 105 5 Health care cost trend rate (b): Increase 1% 94 7 Decrease 1% (76 ) (5 ) Expected long term rate of return on plan assets pretax: Increase 1% (2 ) Decrease 1% 2 (a) Each fluctuation assumes that the other assumptions of the calculation are held constant while the rates are changed by one percentage point. (b) This assumes a 1% change in the initial and ultimate health care cost trend rate. See Note 8 for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Derivative Accounting Derivative accounting requires evaluation of rules that are complex and subject to varying interpretations. Our evaluation of these rules, as they apply to our contracts, determines whether we 57 Table of Contents use accrual accounting (for contracts designated as normal) or fair value (mark to market) accounting. Mark to market accounting requires that changes in the fair value are recognized periodically in income unless certain hedge criteria are met. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in common stock equity (as a component of other comprehensive income (loss)). The fair value of our derivative contracts is not always readily determinable. In some cases, we use models and other valuation techniques to determine fair value. The use of these models and valuation techniques sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment. Actual results could differ from the results estimated through application of these methods. Our marketing and trading portfolio consists of structured activities hedged with a portfolio of forward purchases that protects the economic value of the sales transactions. See Market Risks Commodity Price Risk below for quantitative analysis. See Note 1 for discussion on accounting policies and Note 18 for a further discussion on derivative and energy trading accounting. OTHER ACCOUNTING MATTERS In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This guidance establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The Statement is effective for us on January 1, 2008. We are currently evaluating this new guidance but do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 159 is effective for us on January 1, 2008. We are currently evaluating this new guidance but do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial statements. In April 2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FIN 39 1, Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39, Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts (FSP FIN 39 1). Under FSP FIN 39 1, a reporting entity is permitted to offset the fair value amounts recognized for cash collateral paid or cash collateral received against the fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement. This new guidance is effective for us on January 1, 2008, with early application permitted. We are currently evaluating the impacts of FSP FIN 39 1 on our balance sheet. We do not expect the guidance to have an impact on our results of operations or cash flows. See Note 4 for a discussion of FIN 48 on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which we adopted January 1, 2007. PINNACLE WEST CONSOLIDATED FACTORS AFFECTING OUR FINANCIAL OUTLOOK Factors Affecting Operating Revenues, Fuel and Purchased Power Costs General Electric operating revenues are derived from sales of electricity in regulated retail markets in Arizona and from competitive retail and wholesale power markets in the western United States. For the years 2005 through 2007, retail electric revenues comprised approximately 84% of 58 Table of Contents our total electric operating revenues. Our electric operating revenues are affected by electricity sales volumes related to customer growth, variations in weather from period to period, customer mix, average usage per customer, electricity rates and tariffs and the recovery of PSA deferrals. Off System Sales of excess generation output, purchased power and natural gas are included in regulated electricity segment revenues and related fuel and purchased power because they are credited to APS retail customers through the PSA. These revenue transactions are affected by the availability of excess economic generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions, including demand and prices. Competitive retail sales of energy and energy related products and services are made by APSES in certain western states that have opened to competition. Rate Proceedings Our cash flows and profitability are affected by the rates APS may charge and the timely recovery of costs through those rates. APS retail rates are regulated by the ACC and its wholesale electric rates (primarily for transmission) are regulated by the FERC. APS capital expenditure requirements, which are discussed above under Liquidity and Capital Resources, are substantial because of customer growth in APS service territory and inflationary impacts on the capital budget, highlighting APS need for the timely recovery through rates of these and other expenditures. On June 28, 2007, the ACC issued an order in a general rate case granting APS retail base rate increases. The ACC rate case decision and other retail and wholesale rate matters are discussed in Note 3. Fuel and Purchased Power Costs Fuel and purchased power costs included on our Consolidated Statements of Income are impacted by our electricity sales volumes, existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel, our power plant performance, transmission availability or constraints, prevailing market prices, new generating plants being placed in service in our market areas, our hedging program for managing such costs and, since April 1, 2005, PSA deferrals and the amortization thereof. See PSA Modifications and 2006 Deferrals in Note 3 for information regarding the PSA, including the 2006 Deferrals. APS recovery of PSA deferrals from its ratepayers is subject to annual and, if necessary, periodic PSA adjustments. Customer and Sales Growth The customer and sales growth referred to in this paragraph apply to Native Load customers and sales to them. Customer growth in APS service territory was 3.3% during 2007. Customer growth averaged 4.0% a year for the three years 2005 through 2007; and we currently expect customer growth to decline, averaging about 1% to 2% per year for 2008 through 2010 due to factors reflecting the economic conditions both nationally and in Arizona. For the three years 2005 through 2007, APS actual retail electricity sales in kilowatt hours grew at an average annual rate of 4.8%; adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations, such retail sales growth averaged 3.8% a year. We currently estimate that total retail electricity sales in kilowatt hours will grow 1% to 2% on average per year, during 2008 through 2010, excluding the effects of weather variations. We currently expect our retail sales growth in 2008 to be below average because of potential effects on customer usage from the economic conditions mentioned above and retail rate increases (see Note 3). Actual sales growth, excluding weather related variations, may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors, such as economic conditions, customer growth, usage patterns and responses to retail price changes. Our experience indicates that a reasonable range of variation in our kilowatt hour sales projection attributable to such economic factors can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to $10 million. 59 Table of Contents Weather In forecasting retail sales growth, we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data. Historical extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net income in excess of $20 million. However, our experience indicates that the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to $10 million. Wholesale Market Our marketing and trading activities focus primarily on managing APS risks relating to fuel and purchased power costs in connection with its costs of serving Native Load customer demand. Our marketing and trading activities include, subject to specified parameters, marketing, hedging and trading in electricity, fuels and emission allowances and credits. See Rate Requests for Transmission and Ancillary Services in Note 3 for information regarding APS recent filing with the FERC requesting an increase in transmission rates. Other Factors Affecting Financial Results Operations and Maintenance Expenses Operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by growth, power plant operations, maintenance of utility plant (including generation, transmission, and distribution facilities), inflation, outages, higher trending pension and other postretirement benefit costs and other factors. Depreciation and Amortization Expenses Depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property (such as new generation, transmission, and distribution facilities), and changes in depreciation and amortization rates. See Capital Expenditures above for information regarding planned additions to our facilities. Property Taxes Taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes, which are affected by the value of property in service and under construction, assessment ratios, and tax rates. The average property tax rate for APS, which currently owns the majority of our property, was 8.3% of the assessed value for 2007, 8.9% of assessed value for 2006 and 9.2% for 2005. We expect property taxes to increase as we add new utility plant (including new generation, transmission and distribution facilities) and as we improve our existing facilities. See Capital Expenditures above for information regarding planned additions to our facilities. Interest Expense Interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt. The primary factors affecting borrowing levels are expected to be our capital expenditures, long term debt maturities, and internally generated cash flow. Capitalized interest offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction. We stop accruing capitalized interest on a project when it is placed in commercial operation. Retail Competition Although some very limited retail competition existed in Arizona in 1999 and 2000, there are currently no active retail electric service providers providing unbundled energy or other utility services to APS customers. We cannot predict when, and the extent to which, additional electric service providers will re enter APS service territory. Subsidiaries SunCors net income was $24 million in 2007, $61 million in 2006 and $56 million in 2005. See Note 17 for further discussion. We currently expect SunCors net income in 2008 to be approximately $20 million. This estimate reflects continuation of the slowdown in the western United States real estate markets. 60 Table of Contents The historical results of APSES, Pinnacle West Marketing Trading and El Dorado are not indicative of future performance. General Our financial results may be affected by a number of broad factors. See Forward Looking Statements below for further information on such factors, which may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate. Market Risks Our operations include managing market risks related to changes in interest rates, commodity prices and investments held by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund. Interest Rate and Equity Risk We have exposure to changing interest rates. Changing interest rates will affect interest paid on variable rate debt and the market value of fixed income securities held by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund (see Note 12). The nuclear decommissioning trust fund also has risks associated with the changing market value of its investments. Nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered in regulated electricity prices.

Our ERMC, consisting of officers and key management personnel, oversees company wide energy risk management activities and monitors the results of marketing and trading activities to ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management and trading policies. We manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity instruments that qualify as derivatives, including exchange traded futures and options and over the counter forwards, options and swaps. As part of our risk management program, we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity, fuels and emissions allowances and credits. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodities. The following tables show the net pretax changes in mark to market of our derivative positions in 2007 and 2006 (dollars in millions): 2007 2006 Mark to market of net positions at beginning of year $ 15 $ 516 Recognized in earnings: Change in mark to market losses for future period deliveries (2 ) (27 ) Mark to market gains realized including ineffectiveness during the period (15 ) (3 ) Decrease (increase) in regulatory asset 55 (93 ) Recognized in OCI: Change in mark to market losses for future period deliveries (a) (1 ) (352 ) Mark to market gains realized during the period (12 ) (26 ) Change in valuation techniques Mark to market of net positions at end of year $ 40 $ 15 (a) The decreases in mark to market recorded in OCI are due primarily to decreases in forward natural gas prices. 63 Table of Contents The tables below show the fair value of maturities of our non trading and trading derivative contracts (dollars in millions) at December 31, 2007 by maturities and by the type of valuation that is performed to calculate the fair values.

The impact of these hypothetical price movements would substantially offset the impact that these same price movements would have on the physical exposures being hedged. To the extent the amounts are eligible for inclusion in the PSA, the amounts are recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability. Credit Risk We are exposed to losses in the event of non performance or non payment by counterparties. See Note 1, Derivative Accounting for a discussion of our credit valuation adjustment policy. See Note 18 for further discussion of credit risk. 64 Table of Contents ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Regulatory Matters See Pinnacle West Consolidated Results of Operations Regulatory Matters above for information about the ACCs order in APS general retail rate case and the PSA. 2007 Compared with 2006 Our net income for 2007 was $284 million compared with $270 million for 2006. APS net income increased approximately $14 million primarily due to higher retail sales related to customer growth; the effects of weather on retail sales; and impacts of the retail rate increase. These positive factors were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense primarily due to increased generation costs (including increased maintenance and overhauls and the Palo Verde performance improvement plan), customer service and other costs; higher depreciation and amortization primarily due to increased plant balances; higher interest expense due to higher debt balances and higher rates; lower other income, net of expense, primarily due to miscellaneous asset sales in the prior year and lower interest income as a result of lower investment balances; and a regulatory disallowance (see Note 3). In addition, higher fuel and purchased power costs related to commodity price increases were partially offset by the deferral of such costs in accordance with the PSA. See Note 3 for further discussion. Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with the prior year are contained in the following table (dollars in millions): 65 Table of Contents Increase (Decrease) Pretax After Tax Higher retail sales primarily due to customer growth, excluding weather effects $ 46 $ 28 Effects of weather on retail sales 37 23 Impacts of retail rate increase effective July 1, 2007: Revenue increase related to higher Base Fuel Rate 185 113 Decreased deferred fuel and purchased power costs related to higher Base Fuel Rate (171 ) (104 ) Non fuel rate increase 6 4 Net changes in fuel and purchased power costs related to price: Higher fuel and purchased power costs related to increased commodity prices (121 ) (74 ) Increased deferred fuel and purchased power costs related to increased prices 115 70 Mark to market fuel and purchased power costs, net of related deferred fuel and purchased power costs 18 11 Regulatory disallowance (see Note 3) (14 ) (8 ) Operations and maintenance increases primarily due to: Increased generation costs, including increased maintenance and overhauls and Palo Verde performance improvement plan (25 ) (15 ) Customer service and other costs (19 ) (11 ) Higher depreciation and amortization primarily due to increased plant balances (12 ) (7 ) Lower other income, net of expense, primarily due to lower interest income as a result of lower investment balances and miscellaneous asset sales in prior year (7 ) (4 ) Income tax benefits resolved in 2007 related to prior years 11 Income tax credits resolved in 2006 related to prior years (11 ) Higher interest expense, net of capitalized financing costs, primarily due to higher debt balances and higher rates (7 ) (4 ) Lower marketing and trading contribution primarily due to lower mark to market gains because of changes in forward prices (7 ) (4 ) Other miscellaneous items, net 2 (4 ) Increase in net income $ 26 $ 14 Electric operating revenues were $278 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with the prior year primarily because of: a $191 million increase in retail revenues due to a rate increase effective July 1, 2007; a $60 million increase in retail revenues primarily related to customer growth, excluding weather effects; a $50 million increase in retail revenues due to the effects of weather; 66 Table of Contents a $3 million increase in revenues from Off System Sales due to higher prices and volumes; a $35 million decrease in retail revenues related to recovery of PSA deferrals, which had no earnings effect because of amortization of the same amount recorded as fuel and purchased power expense (see Note 3); and a $9 million net increase due to miscellaneous factors. 2006 Compared with 2005 APS net income for 2006 was $270 million compared with $170 million for the comparable prior year. The $100 million increase was primarily due to an $84 million after tax regulatory disallowance of plant costs recorded in 2005. Income also increased due to higher retail sales volumes due to customer growth; higher marketing and trading gross margin primarily due to higher mark to market gains; income tax credits related to prior years resolved in 2006; and increased other income due to higher interest income on higher investment balances. These positive factors were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense related to generation and customer service; higher depreciation and amortization primarily due to increased plant asset balances, partially offset by lower depreciation rates; and higher interest expense. In addition, higher fuel and purchased power costs of $74 million after tax were partially offset by the deferral of $45 million after tax costs in accordance with the PSA. 67 Table of Contents Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 are contained in the following table (dollars in millions): Increase (Decrease) Pretax After Tax Higher fuel and purchased power costs (see Note 3) $ (121 ) $ (74 ) Higher retail sales volumes due to customer growth, excluding weather effects 87 53 Increased deferred fuel and purchased power costs (deferrals began April 1, 2005) 73 45 Absence of prior year cost based contract for PWEC Dedicated Assets (see Note 3) 56 34 Higher marketing and trading gross margin primarily related to higher mark to market gains 20 12 Regulatory disallowance of plant costs in 2005, in accordance with APS 2003 general retail rate case settlement 139 84 Operations and maintenance increases primarily due to: Generation costs, including increased maintenance and overhauls (41 ) (25 ) Costs of PWEC Dedicated Assets not included in prior year (18 ) (11 ) Customer service costs, including regulatory demand side management programs and planned maintenance (16 ) (10 ) Miscellaneous items, net 1 1 Depreciation and amortization increases primarily due to: Higher depreciable assets due to transfer of PWEC Dedicated Assets (see Note 3) (14 ) (8 ) Higher other depreciable assets partially offset by lower depreciation rates (14 ) (8 ) Higher interest expense, net of capitalized financing costs, primarily due to higher debt balances and higher rates (14 ) (8 ) Higher other income, net of expense, primarily due to miscellaneous asset sales and increased interest income on higher investment balances 9 5 Income tax credits related to prior years resolved in 2006 11 Miscellaneous items, net (7 ) (1 ) Increase in net income $ 140 $ 100 Electric operating revenues were $388 million higher for 2006 compared with the prior year primarily as a result of: a $265 million increase in revenues related to recovery of PSA deferrals, which had no earnings effect because of amortization of the same amount recorded as fuel and purchased power expense; a $124 million increase in retail revenues related to customer growth, excluding weather effects; and a $1 million decrease due to miscellaneous factors. 68 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY Operating Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $766 million for 2007, compared with $394 million for 2006, an increase in net cash flow of $372 million. This change was primarily due to a decrease in 2007 in the amount of cash collateral and margin cash returned to counterparties as a result of changes in commodity prices. Net cash provided by operating activities was $394 million for 2006, compared with $722 million for 2005, a decrease in net cash flow of $328 million.
