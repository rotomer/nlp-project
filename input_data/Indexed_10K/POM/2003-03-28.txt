MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The information required by this item is contained herein, as follows: Registrants Page No. Pepco Holdings 15 Pepco 55 Conectiv 69 DPL 76 ACE 81 ACE Funding 85 THIS PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PEPCO HOLDINGS, INC. OVERVIEW Pepco Holdings, Inc. (Pepco Holdings or the Company, formerly New RC, Inc.), a registered holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA), was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on February 9, 2001 for the purpose of effecting Potomac Electric Power Companys (Pepco) acquisition of Conectiv, which was consummated on August 1, 2002. Upon the completion of the merger, Pepco and Conectiv became wholly owned subsidiaries of Pepco Holdings. Additionally, Pepco, through a series of transactions, transferred its ownership interests in its pre merger subsidiaries Potomac Capital Investment Corporation (PCI) and Pepco Energy Services, Inc. (Pepco Energy Services) to Pepco Holdings and PCI transferred its ownership interests in its pre merger subsidiary Pepco Communications, Inc. (Pepcom) to Pepco Holdings. These transactions resulted in PCI, Pepco Energy Services, and Pepcom becoming wholly owned subsidiaries of Pepco Holdings. Pepco Holdings manages the operations of its subsidiaries as described below. Power Delivery The largest component of Pepco Holdings business is power delivery, which is conducted through its subsidiaries Pepco, Delmarva Power & Light Company (DPL), and Atlantic City Electric Company (ACE). Pepco, DPL and ACE are all regulated public utilities in the jurisdictions in which they serve customers. The operations of DPL and ACE collectively are referred to as "Conectiv Power Delivery." Pepco Pepco is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity in Washington, D.C. and major portions of Prince Georges and Montgomery Counties in suburban Maryland. As of December 31, 2002, Pepco delivered power to approximately 722,000 customers. Under settlements entered into with regulatory authorities, Pepco is required to provide electricity supply at specified rates (referred to as "default service") to customers in Maryland until July 2004 and to customers in Washington, D.C. until February 2005. Under a full requirements contract entered into in 2000 in connection with the purchase by Mirant Corporation of substantially all of Pepcos electricity generation assets, Mirant is obligated to supply Pepco with all of the capacity and energy needed to fulfill these default service obligations at fixed prices that are lower than currently approved tariff rates that Pepco charges for providing such service. If Mirant were to fail to ful fill its supply obligations, Pepco would have to find alternative sources of supply at rates then prevailing. Conectiv Power Delivery DPL is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity in Delaware and portions of Maryland and Virginia and provides gas distribution service in northern Delaware. As of December 31, 2002, DPL delivered electricity to approximately 485,100 customers and gas to approximately 115,400 customers. Under regulatory settlements, DPL is required to provide default service to customers in Maryland until July 2004, to customers in Delaware until May 2006, and to customers in Virginia until January 2004 (which may be extended to July 2007). Conectiv Energy (described below) supplies all of DPLs default service load requirements under a supply agreement that ends May 31, 2006. The terms of the supply agreement are structured to coincide with DPLs load requirements for each of its regulatory settlements. Conectiv Energys resources for supplying DPLs default service load include electricity generated by Conectiv Energys plants and electri city purchased under long term agreements. DPL purchases gas supplies for its customers from marketers and producers in the spot market and under short term and long term agreements. ACE is engaged in the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity in southern New Jersey. As of December 31, 2002, ACE delivered electricity to approximately 514,300 customers. ACE has default service obligations, known as Basic Generation Service (BGS), for approximately 20 percent of the electricity supply to its customers. ACE expects to fulfill these obligations through the generation output from its fossil fuel fired generating plants and through existing purchase power agreements with non utility generators (NUG). As discussed in the "Regulatory and Other Matters" section herein, in January 2003, ACE terminated its competitive bidding process to sell these generation assets. ACE formed Atlantic City Electric Transition Funding LLC (ACE Transition Funding) during 2001. ACE Transition Funding, which is discussed in the "Regulatory and Other Matters" section below, is a wholly owned subsidiary of ACE. Competitive Energy This component of the Companys business is conducted through subsidiaries of Conectiv Energy Holding Company (collectively referred to herein as Conectiv Energy) and Pepco Energy Services. Conectiv Energy Holding Company and Pepco Energy Services are subsidiaries of Pepco Holdings. Conectiv Energy Conectiv Energy supplies power to DPL, under a power sales contract, and provides wholesale power and ancillary services to the Pennsylvania/New Jersey/Maryland (PJM) power pool. Conectiv Energys generation asset strategy focuses on mid merit plants with operating flexibility, multi fuel capability and low capital requirements that can quickly change their output level on an economic basis. Mid merit plants generally are operated during times when demand for electricity rises and prices are higher. Until March 3, 2003, Conectiv Energy also engaged in energy trading intended to take advantage of price fluctuations and arbitrage opportunities. As of December 31, 2002, Conectiv Energy owned and operated electric generating plants with 2,600 MW of capacity. In January 2002 Conectiv Energy began construction of a 1,100 MW combined cycle plant with six combustion turbines at a site in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania that is expected to become fully operational in stages adding 360 MW in 2002 and an additional 740 MW of capacity in 2003. In addition, Conectiv Energy has ordered seven combustion turbines which, with additional equipment, could be configured into up to three combined cycle plants with approximately 550 MW of capacity each. Through December 31, 2002 a total of $192.3 million has been paid for these turbines. The total cost to purchase the combustion turbines is approximately $235 million. In August of 2002, as part of the acquisition of Conectiv by Pepco, the book value of these combustion turbines was adjusted down to the then fair market value of $153 million (approximately 35% lo wer than the purchase cost). Construction of these additional plants is subject to market and other conditions but is currently scheduled to occur in phases to be completed in 2007 and 2008. In light of continuing declines in wholesale energy prices, further analysis of energy markets and projections of future demand for electricity, among other factors, Conectiv Energy is considering all of its options including delaying delivery of equipment, delaying construction, selling the equipment and canceling equipment orders. Pepco Energy Services Pepco Energy Services provides retail electricity and natural gas to residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers in the District of Columbia and states in the mid Atlantic region. Pepco Energy Services also provides integrated energy management solutions to commercial, industrial and governmental customers, including energy efficiency contracting, development and construction of "green power" facilities, equipment operation and maintenance, fuel management, and appliance service agreements. In addition, Pepco Energy Services owns electricity generation plants with approximately 800 MW of peaking capacity, the output of which is sold in the wholesale market. Pepco Energy Services also purchases and sells electricity and natural gas in the wholesale markets to support its commitments to its retail customers. Other Non Regulated This component of Pepco Holdings business is conducted through its subsidiaries PCI and Pepcom. PCI PCI manages a portfolio of financial investments and strategic operating businesses that are designed to provide supplemental earnings and cash flow. PCI has been redirecting its investment operations to focus on investments that are related to the energy industry, such as energy leveraged leases. These transactions involve PCIs purchase and leaseback of utility assets, located outside of the United States, that are designed to provide a long term, stable stream of cash flow and earnings. PCI has reduced its previous concentration of investments in the aircraft industry from 33 aircraft in 1995 to three aircraft currently. PCI also owns a ten story, 360,000 square foot office building in downtown Washington, D.C., which is leased to Pepco and serves as Pepco Holdings and Pepcos corporate headquarters. PCIs utility industry products and services are provided through various operating companies. Its underground electric services company, W.A. Chester, provides high voltage construction and maintenance services to utilities and to other customers throughout the United States. PCI also owns Severn Cable, which provides low voltage electric and telecommunication construction and maintenance services in the Washington, D.C. area. Pepcom Pepcom owns a 50% interest in Starpower Communications, LLC (Starpower) a joint venture with RCN Corporation, which provides cable and telecommunication services to households in the Washington, D.C. area. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has defined a companys most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results of operations, and which require the Company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, Pepco Holdings has identified the critical accounting policies and judgments as addressed below. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pepco Holdings and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions between subsidiaries have been eliminated. Investments in entities in which Pepco Holdings has a 20% to 50% interest are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, investments are initially carried at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Companys proportionate share of the investees undistributed earnings or losses and dividends. Accounting Policy Choices Pepco Holdings management believes that based on the nature of the businesses that its subsidiaries operate the Company has very little choice regarding the accounting policies it utilizes. For instance, approximately 70% of Pepco Holdings business consists of its regulated utility operations, which are subject to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71 "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." However, in the areas that Pepco Holdings is afforded accounting policy choices, management does not believe that the application of different accounting policies than those that it chose would materially impact its financial position or results of operations. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, such as Statement of Position 94 6 "Disclosure of Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties," requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Examples of estimates used by the Company include the calculation of the allowance for uncollectible accounts, environmental remediation costs and anticipated collections, unbilled revenue, pension assumptions, fair values used in the purchase method of accounting and the resulting goodwill balance. Although Pepco Holdings believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may d iffer significantly from these estimates. Revenue Recognition Power Delivery revenues primarily include revenues from the supply and delivery of electricity to the customers of Pepco, DPL, and ACE. Revenues from the supply and delivery of natural gas to DPLs customers are also included in Power Delivery. Competitive Energy revenues are primarily derived from electricity and natural gas trading activities and strategic generation, which is the sale of electricity, capacity, and ancillary services from deregulated electric generating plants. It also includes revenues from wholesale and retail sales of electricity and natural gas to customers that are supplied by purchases in wholesale markets and revenues from energy management products, and services. Other Non Regulated revenues are provided by Pepco Holdings non utility subsidiary PCI. The Power Delivery businesses recognize revenues for the supply and delivery of electricity and gas upon delivery to the customer, including amounts for services rendered, but not yet billed. Conectiv Energy recognizes revenue when delivery is substantially complete for non trading activities, and on a mark to market basis for trading activities. Pepco Energy Services recognizes revenue for its wholesale and retail commodity business upon delivery to customers. Revenues for Pepco Energy Services energy efficiency construction business is recognized using the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition and revenues from its operation and maintenance and other products and services contracts are recognized when earned. Revenues from the Other Non Regulated business lines are principally recognized when services are performed or products are delivered; however, revenue from PCIs utility industry services contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition, which recognizes revenue as work progresses on the contract. Accounting For the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation The requirements of SFAS No. 71 apply to the Power Delivery businesses of Pepco, DPL, and ACE. SFAS No. 71 allows regulated entities, in appropriate circumstances, to establish regulatory assets and to defer the income statement impact of certain costs that are expected to be recovered in future rates. Managements assessment of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets requires judgment and interpretation of laws, regulatory commission orders, and other factors. Should existing facts or circumstances change in the future to indicate that a regulatory asset is not probable of recovery, then the regulatory asset would be charged to earnings. Accounting for Goodwill and Certain Other Intangibles Effective January 1, 2002, Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries adopted the full provisions of SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141 requires business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets apart from goodwill. SFAS 142 requires that purchased goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangibles no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. Additionally, because Pepco Holdings completed the net asset valuation and determination of goodwill process in August 2002, the Company did not test for impairment in 2002 and therefore intends to test for impairment during 2003. Accounting For Derivatives SFAS No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" requires derivative instruments to be measured at fair value. The gain or loss on a derivative that hedges exposure to variable cash flow of a forecasted transaction is initially recorded in other comprehensive income (a separate component of common stockholders equity) and is subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction occurs. If a forecasted transaction is no longer probable, the deferred gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income is immediately reclassified to earnings. Changes in the fair value of other hedging derivatives result in a change in the value of the asset, liability, or firm commitment being hedged; to the extent the hedge is effective. Any ineffective portion of a hedge is recognized in earnings immediately. In June 2002, Pepco Holdings entered into several treasury lock transactions in anticipation of the issuance of several series of fixed rate debt commencing in July 2002. These treasury lock transactions, which were designated as qualified cash flow hedges in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 133, were intended to offset the changes in future cash flows attributable to fluctuations in interest rates. Upon the closing of the sale of the debt on September 6, 2002, the net loss on the settlement of the treasury lock transactions of $63.4 million (after tax) was recorded as accumulated other comprehensive loss and began to be amortized into interest expense over the life of the related debt. Additionally, the fair value of the liability of $106.1 million (pre tax) was paid by Pepco Holdings on September 4, 2002, the hedge settlement date. Conectiv Energy engages in commodity hedging activities to minimize the risk of market fluctuations associated with the purchase and sale of energy commodities (natural gas, petroleum, coal and electricity). The majority of these hedges relate to the procurement of fuel for its power plants, fixing the cash flows from the plant output, and securing power for electric load service. Conectiv Energys hedging activities are conducted using derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, which are designed to reduce the variability in future cash flows. Conectiv Energys commodity hedging objectives, in accordance with its risk management policy, are primarily the assurance of stable and known cash flows and the fixing of favorable prices and margins when they become available. Conectiv Bethlehem, LLC (CBI), a subsidiary of Conectiv Energy, entered into an interest rate swap agreement for the purpose of managing its overall borrowing rate and limiting its interest rate risk associated with debt it has incurred. CBI currently hedges 75% of the interest rate payments for its variable rate debt. CBI formally designated its interest rate swap agreements as a cash flow hedge. Pepco Energy Services purchases natural gas futures and electricity forward contracts to hedge price risk in connection with the purchase of physical natural gas and electricity for delivery to customers in future months. Pepco Energy Services accounts for its natural gas futures and electricity forward contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions. PCI has entered into interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of managing its overall borrowing rate and limiting its interest rate risk associated with debt it has issued. PCI currently hedges 100% of its variable rate debt and approximately 24% of its fixed rate debt for the Medium Term Note program. PCI formally designated its interest rate swap agreements as both cash flow hedge and fair value hedge instruments, as appropriate. On October 25, 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) rescinded Issue No. 98 10 (EITF 98 10) "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." The Companys interpretation of EITF 98 10 is consistent with the current rules that are being applied under SFAS No. 133 and therefore management does not believe that rescinding EITF 98 10 will impact its financial position or results of operations. Energy Trading Activities In 2002, a pronouncement was issued by the EITF entitled EITF Issue No. 02 3 (EITF 02 3) "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities," which addresses the presentation of revenue and expense associated with "energy trading book" contracts on a gross vs. net basis. Previously the EITF concluded that gross presentation was acceptable, but with the issuance of EITF 02 3 and the subsequent guidance provided by the EITF in June and September 2002, net presentation is required. Conectiv Energy and Pepco Energy Services enter into transactions that are subject to the provisions of this pronouncement and both historically have classified these contracts on a gross basis. Conectiv Energy and Pepco Energy Services have completed their evaluation of the financial statement reclassification required by EITF 02 3. Beginning with July 2002, all of their trades were recorded net and therefore no reclassification was required for activities after July 2002. Accordingly, since Conectiv Energys operating results that are included in Pepco Holdings results herein consist only of the post merger months of August 2002 through December 2002, no revenue or expense reclassifications are required for Conectiv Energys portion of Pepco Holdings results. However, based on the provisions of EITF 02 3, Pepco Energy Services results during the period January 2002 through June 2002 required a reclassification adjustment that reduced its revenues by $22.6 million. Additionally, Pepco Energy Services revenues decreased from $643.9 million to $541.5 million and from $234.9 million to $212.4 million, for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. There is no impact on Conectiv Energys or Pepco Energy Services overall financial position or net results of operations as a result of the implementation of EITF 02 3. Leasing Activities Pepco Holdings accounts for leases entered into by its subsidiaries in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 13, "Accounting for Leases." Income from investments in direct financing leases and leveraged lease transactions, in which PCI is an equity participant, is accounted for using the financing method. In accordance with the financing method, investments in leased property are recorded as a receivable from the lessee to be recovered through the collection of future rentals. For direct financing leases, unearned income is amortized to income over the lease term at a constant rate of return on the net investment. Income including investment tax credits, on leveraged equipment leases, is recognized over the life of the lease at a constant rate of return on the positive net investment. Investments in equipment under operating leases are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded on a straight line basis over the equipments estimated useful life. Pension and Other Post Employment Benefit Plans Pepco Holdings has a noncontributory retirement plan (the Plan) that covers substantially all employees of Pepco, DPL, ACE, and certain employees of other Pepco Holdings subsidiaries. Following the consummation of the acquisition of Conectiv by Pepco on August 1, 2002, the Pepco General Retirement Plan and the Conectiv Retirement Plan were merged into the Plan on December 31, 2002. The provisions and benefits of the merged plan for Pepco employees are identical to those of the original Pepco plan and for DPL and ACE employees the provisions and benefits are identical to the original Conectiv plan. In addition to providing pension benefits, Pepco Holdings also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible employees (OPEBS). The Company accounts for the Plan in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" and its OPEBS in accordance with SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." The Companys financial statement disclosures were prepared in accordance with SFAS No. 132, "Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits." New Accounting Standards In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 143 entitled "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," which is required to be adopted for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002 (the Companys first quarter 2003 financial statements). This Statement establishes the accounting and reporting standards for measuring and recording asset retirement obligations. The Company has completed its assessment of the provisions of SFAS No. 143 and believes that although the implementation of the Statement will result in certain account reclassifications it will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections." SFAS No. 145 rescinds SFAS No. 4, "Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt (an amendment of APB Opinion No. 30)." SFAS No. 4 had required that material gains and losses on extinguishment of debt be classified as an extraordinary item. Under SFAS No. 145, SFAS No. 4 is rescinded effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. Due to the rescission of SFAS No. 4, it is less likely that a gain or loss on extinguishment of debt would be classified as an extraordinary item in Pepco Holdings Consolidated Statements of Income. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, which requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when the costs are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The primary effect of applying SFAS No. 146 will be on the timing of recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities. In many cases, those costs will be recognized as liabilities in periods following a commitment to a plan, not at the date of the commitment. SFAS No. 146 is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure," which amends FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," which is effective for interim periods ending after December 15, 2002 (the Companys first quarter 2003 financial statements). This statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Pepco Holdings currently accounts for its stock based compensation plan using the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 2 5, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." The Company believes that the implementation of SFAS 148 will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" (FIN 45). FIN 45 requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, a guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee. Additional disclosures are also prescribed for certain guarantee contracts. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 are effective for any guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002 (the Companys first quarter 2003 financial statements). The Company is in the process of assessing the provisions of FIN 45 in order to determine its impact on the Companys financial position and results of operations. In January 2003, FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" (FIN 46). Pepco Holdings is in the process of assessing the provisions of FIN 46 in order to determine its impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS LACK OF COMPARABILITY OF OPERATING RESULTS WITH PRIOR YEARS As a result of the merger transaction on August 1, 2002, Pepco Holdings accompanying consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statements of shareholders equity as of December 31, 2002 include the accounts of Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries (discussed in Note (1) Organization, herein), after giving effect to the merger transaction and resulting purchase accounting entries discussed in Note (2) Merger Transaction, herein. Since Pepco was the acquiring company, in accordance with the purchase method of accounting, Pepco represents the "predecessor" company. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2001, and the consolidated statements of shareholders equity as of December 31, 2001, and 2000, respectively, as previously reported by Pepco, include only the consolidated accounts of Pepco and its pre merger subsidiaries, PCI and Pepco Energy Services. The accompanying consolidated statements of earnings, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2002 include Pepcos and its pre merger subsidiaries operating results for the full year consolidated with Conectiv and its subsidiaries operating results for the five months of August 1, 2002, the date the merger was consummated, through December 31, 2002. The accompanying consolidated statements of earnings, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, and consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, as previously reported by Pepco, include only the consolidated operations of Pepco and its pre merger subsidiaries. Accordingly, due to the application of the purchase method of accounting that was used to record the merger transaction, the consolidated balances included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 are not comparable. OPERATING REVENUE Results for 2002 Compared to 2001 Total consolidated operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002, was $4,324.5 million compared to $2,400.5 million for 2001. Intercompany revenue has been eliminated for purposes of this analysis. An detail of these amounts is as follows: 2002 2001 Change Pepco $1,533.5 $1,723.5 (190.0) Conectiv Power Delivery 996.2 996.2 Conectiv Energy 850.2 850.2 Pepco Energy Services 826.7 541.5 285.2 Other Non Regulated 117.9 106.2 11.7 Gain on divestiture of generation assets 29.3 (29.3) Total $4,324.5 $2,400.5 The decrease in Pepcos operating revenue during 2002 primarily resulted from a decrease of $206.9 million in standard offer service revenue due to increased customer migration to alternate suppliers during 2002. Retail access to a competitive market for generation services was made available to all Maryland customers on July 1, 2000 and to D.C. customers on January 1, 2001. At December 31, 2002, 16% of Pepcos Maryland customers and 13% of its D.C. customers have chosen alternate suppliers. These customers accounted for 1,175 megawatts of load in Maryland (of Pepcos total load of 3,369) and 1,140 megawatts of load in D.C. (of Pepcos total load of 2,326). The decrease in standard offer service revenue was partially offset by a $26.3 million increase in delivery revenue due to higher delivered kilowatt hour sales from more favorable weather than experienced in 2001. The amounts for Conectiv Power Delivery and Conectiv Energy represented their post merger operations for the five months of August 2002 through December 2002. The increase in Pepco Energy Services operating revenue during 2002 primarily resulted from growth in its retail commodity business for sales of electricity and natural gas to new customers. The increase in Other Non Regulated operating revenue during 2002 was mainly due to higher lease portfolio income derived from new energy leveraged leases entered into in late 2001 and throughout 2002. The prior year results included a $29.3 million net gain that resulted from the sale of Pepcos interest in the Conemaugh generating station in January 2001. Results for 2001 Compared to 2000 Total consolidated operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $2,400.5 million compared to $2,989.3 million for 2000. Intercompany revenue has been eliminated for purposes of this analysis. A detail of these amounts is as follows: 2001 2000 Change Pepco $1,723.5 $2,220.6 (497.1) Conectiv Power Delivery Conectiv Energy Pepco Energy Services 541.5 212.4 329.1 Other Non Regulated 106.2 132.5 (26.3) Gain on divestiture of generation assets 29.3 423.8 (394.5) Total $2,400.5 $2,989.3 The decrease in Pepcos operating revenue during 2001 resulted from decreases of $466.9 million in standard offer service revenue and $30.2 million in delivery revenue primarily due to increased customer migration to alternative suppliers during 2001. Retail access to competitive markets for generation services was made available to all Maryland customers on July 1, 2000 and to D.C. customers on January 1, 2001. At December 31, 2001, 12% of Pepcos Maryland customers and 4% of its D.C. customers had chosen alternate suppliers. These customers accounted for 800 megawatts of load in Maryland (of our total load of 3,369) and 1,026 megawatts of load in D.C. (of our total load of 2,326). The increase in Pepco Energy Services operating revenue during 2001 primarily resulted from increases of $283.2 million in commodity revenues and $44.3 million in services revenues due to growth in its retail commodity business. The decrease in Other Non Regulated operating revenue during 2001 primarily resulted from the fact that in 2000 PCI recorded a pre tax gain of approximately $19.7 million ($11.8 million after tax) from the sale of its 50% interest in the Cove Point liquefied natural gas storage facility. The gain on divestiture of generation assets of $29.3 million in 2001 resulted from the sale of Pepcos interest in the Conemaugh generating station in January 2001. The 2001 gain on divestiture also includes certain adjustments resulting from the 2000 Mirant divestiture transaction. The gain of $423.8 million in 2000 resulted from Pepcos sale of substantially all of its generating assets to Mirant Corp. in December 2000. OPERATING EXPENSES Results for 2002 Compared to 2001 Total consolidated operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002, were $3,778.9 million compared to $2,034.1 million for 2001. Intercompany expenses have been eliminated for purposes of this analysis. A detail of these amounts is as follows: 2002 2001 Change Pepco $1,219.7 $1,363.7 (144.0) Conectiv Power Delivery 649.2 649.2 Conectiv Energy 1,071.8 1,071.8 Pepco Energy Services 809.6 524.1 285.5 Other Non Regulated 53.7 146.3 (92.6) Corporate and Other (25.1) (25.1) Total $3,778.9 $2,034.1 The decrease in Pepcos operating expenses during 2002 resulted primarily from a $179.7 million decrease in fuel and purchased energy expense due to less energy purchased because of increased customer migration. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in other operation and maintenance expense of $13.8 million due mainly to an increase in employee benefits and vacation liability accrual as well as from a general increase in power delivery expenses, an increase in other taxes of $11.7 million due to higher Maryland property and delivery taxes, and an increase of $8.5 million in depreciation expense. The amounts for Conectiv Power Delivery and Conectiv Energy represented their post merger operations for the five months of August 2002 through December 2002. The increase in Pepco Energy Services operating expenses during 2002 primarily resulted from growth in its retail commodity business and due to the fact that 2002 reflected a full year of operations from businesses acquired in 2001. The decrease in Other Non Regulated operating expenses during 2002 primarily resulted from lower depreciation expense incurred as a result of fewer aircraft on operating leases in 2002 and due to the fact that in 2001 PCI recognized a total of $65.5 million (pre tax) in impairment write downs related to its aircraft portfolio and other investments. "Corporate and Other" primarily includes severance costs of $25.4 million (pre tax) recorded during 2002 related to Pepco and Conectiv. Additionally, this line item includes unallocated Pepco Holdings operating expenses, such as the acquisition financing and the amortization of "purchase accounting" related adjustments to the fair value of non regulated Conectiv assets and liabilities as of August 1, 2002. Additionally, process improvements may result in potential savings of $45 million for Pepco Holdings over the next 5 years. Results for 2001 Compared to 2000 Total consolidated operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001, were $2,034.1 million compared to $2,094.2 million for 2000. Intercompany expenses have been eliminated for purposes of this analysis. A detail of these amounts is as follows: 2001 2000 Change Pepco $1,363.7 $1,794.8 (431.1) Conectiv Power Delivery Conectiv Energy Pepco Energy Services 524.1 228.9 295.2 Other Non Regulated 146.3 70.5 75.8 Total $2,034.1 $2,094.2 The decrease in Pepcos operating expenses during 2001 primarily resulted from a $180.6 million decrease in fuel and purchased energy expense, a $105.3 million decrease in other operation and maintenance expense, an $84 million decrease in depreciation expense, and a $20.9 million decrease in other taxes. The decreases in these expenses primarily resulted from the fact that in January 2001 Pepco completed its plan to exit the generation business by divesting of its interest in the Conemaugh generating station. Additionally, the remaining decrease in operating expenses in 2001 results from the fact that the 2000 results included an impairment loss recorded on Pepcos Benning Road and Buzzard Point generating plants of $40.3 million (pre tax). These plants were subsequently transferred to Pepco Energy Services. The increase in Pepco Energy Services operating expenses during 2001 resulted from growth in its retail commodity business. The increase in Other Non Regulated operating expenses during 2001 primarily resulted from a total of $65.5 million (pre tax) in impairment write downs recognized by PCI in 2001 related to its aircraft portfolio and other investments. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSES) Results for 2002 Compared to 2001 Total consolidated other (expenses) for the year ended December 31, 2002, were ($190.4) million compared to ($105.3) million for 2001. A detail of these amounts is as follows: 2002 2001 Change Pepco $ (71.6) $ (48.8) 22.8 Conectiv Power Delivery (25.9) 25.9 Conectiv Energy (5.0) 5.0 Pepco Energy Services (1.0) 1.4 2.4 Other Non Regulated (52.0) (57.9) (5.9) Corporate and Other (34.9) 34.9 Total $(190.4) $(105.3) The increase in Pepcos other (expenses) during 2002 primarily resulted from a $37.1 million decrease in interest income earned due to lower proceeds remaining to invest from Pepcos generating asset divestitures. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $21.8 million in interest expense due to lower debt balances outstanding during 2002. The amounts for Conectiv Power Delivery and Conectiv Energy represented their post merger operations for the five months of August 2002 through December 2002. The decrease in Other Non Regulated other (expenses) during 2002 primarily resulted from reduced losses on Pepcoms investment in Starpower due to its improved margins, lower selling, general and administrative expenses, and the favorable impact of the termination of the requirement to amortize goodwill. "Corporate and Other" in 2002 primarily represents unallocated Pepco Holdings capital costs, such as the acquisition financing and the amortization of "purchase accounting" related adjustments to the fair value of non regulated Conectiv assets and liabilities as of August 1, 2002. Additionally, this amount includes the write off of certain Pepco software costs related to software that was no longer being used. Results for 2001 Compared to 2000 Total consolidated other (expenses) for the year ended December 31, 2001, were ($105.3) million compared to ($192.7) million for 2000. A detail of these amounts is as follows: 2001 2000 Change Pepco $ (48.8) $(138.6) (89.8) Conectiv Power Delivery Conectiv Energy Pepco Energy Services 1.4 3.0 1.6 Other Non Regulated (57.9) (57.1) .8 Total $(105.3) $(192.7) The decrease in Pepcos other (expenses) during 2001 primarily resulted from a $40.6 million increase in interest income due to proceeds invested from the Companys divestiture transactions and due to a decrease of $52.2 million in interest expense due to reductions in the level of Pepcos debt outstanding. A portion of the divestiture proceeds were used to pay off Pepcos outstanding debt. INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT) Results for 2002 Compared to 2001 Total consolidated income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2002, was $124.1 million compared to $83.5 million for 2001. A detail of these amounts is as follows: 2002 2001 Change Pepco $ 81.7 $130.9 $(49.2) Conectiv Power Delivery 20.1 20.1 Conectiv Energy 19.4 19.4 Pepco Energy Services 3.8 8.5 (4.7) Other Non Regulated (7.3) (55.9) 48.6 Corporate and Other 6.4 6.4 Total $124.1 $ 83.5 The decrease in Pepcos income tax expense during 2002 resulted from lower taxes as a result of lower interest income and due to the fact that the 2001 amount included taxes incurred on Pepcos generating plant divestiture. The amounts for Conectiv Power Delivery and Conectiv Energy represented their post merger operations for the five months of August 2002 through December 2002. Income tax expense for Pepco Energy Services remained relatively stable between years. The decrease in Other Non Regulated income tax (benefit) during 2002 primarily resulted from the benefit derived in 2001 from one time impairment write downs associated with the aircraft portfolio and other investments. Results for 2001 Compared to 2000 Total consolidated income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $83.5 million compared to $341.2 million for 2000. A detail of these amounts is as follows: 2001 2000 Change Pepco $130.9 $352.9 (222.0) Conectiv Power Delivery Conectiv Energy Pepco Energy Services 8.5 (4.7) 13.2 Other Non Regulated (55.9) (7.0) (48.9) Total $ 83.5 $341.2 The decrease in Pepcos income tax expense during 2001 primarily resulted from the fact that the 2000 tax expense included taxes resulting from the gain on the divestiture of its generating plants in December 2000. The increase in Pepco Energy Services income tax expense during 2001 resulted from improved operating results in its retail commodity and wholesale generation business along with an increase in the effective tax rate. The increase in Other Non Regulated income tax (benefit) during 2001 principally resulted from the write down of the aircraft portfolio and other investments. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Sources of Liquidity Due to $805.5 million of cash provided by operating activities, $1,920.4 million of cash used by investing activities, and $698.2 million of cash provided by financing activities, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $416.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease primarily results from the fact that $1,075.6 million in cash was used to acquire Conectiv (net of Conectiv cash acquired). Pepco Holdings relies on access to bank and capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by cash provided by its subsidiaries operations. Pepco Holdings generates no operating income on its own. Accordingly, Pepco Holdings ability to pay dividends to its common shareholders will depend on dividends received from its subsidiaries. The ability of Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries to borrow funds or issue securities and its financing costs are affected by the issuing companys credit ratings. In addition to their future financial performance, the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends to Pepco Holdings is subject to the limits imposed by: state corporate and regulatory laws, which contain limitations on the funds that can be used to pay dividends and, in the case of regulatory laws, may require the prior approval of the relevant utility regulatory commissions before dividends can be paid; PU HCA, which prohibits the payment of dividends by a registered holding company or any of its subsidiaries, not afforded an exemption, out of capital or unearned surplus without the prior approval of the SEC; the provisions of their respective charters and bylaws; and the prior rights of holders of existing and future preferred stock, mortgage bonds and other long term debt issued by the subsidiaries, and other restrictions in connection with other liabilities. PUHCA Restrictions Because the Company is a holding company registered under PUHCA, it must obtain SEC approval to issue securities. Under PUHCA, Pepco Holdings may not pay dividends on the shares of common stock from an accumulated deficit or from paid in capital without SEC approval. PUHCA also prohibits Pepco Holdings from borrowing from its subsidiaries. Under an SEC Financing Order dated July 31, 2002 (the "Financing Order"), Pepco Holdings is authorized to issue equity, preferred securities and debt securities in an aggregate amount not to exceed $3.5 billion through the authorization period ending June 30, 2005. The external financing limit includes a short term debt outstanding limitation of $2.5 billion. Pepco Holdings is also authorized to enter into guarantees to third parties or otherwise provide credit support with respect to obligations of its subsidiaries for up to $3.5 billion. The Financing Order requires that, in order to iss ue debt or equity securities, the Company must maintain a ratio of common stock equity to total capitalization (consisting of common stock, preferred stock, if any, long term debt and short term debt) of at least 30 percent. If this ratio falls below 30 percent (and the Company does not obtain from the SEC an amended order permitting it to maintain a lower ratio), the Company will not have the authority to issue either debt or equity securities, including additional commercial paper issued to refinance maturing commercial paper. At December 31, 2002, the Companys common equity ratio was 31.6 percent or approximately $149.8 million in excess of the 30 percent threshold. The Company intends to take such actions as necessary to prevent the common equity ratio from dropping below 30 percent, including the sale of additional shares of common stock. In this regard, the Company issued 5,750,000 shares of common stock in December 2002, as described below. The Company may also request an amendmen t to the SEC order that would permit the common equity ratio to temporarily drop below 30 percent for a period of time. However, the Company can give no assurance as to the timely receipt of such amendment. In connection with the merger with Conectiv, the SEC required PCI to divest itself of its marketable securities portfolio, its remaining aircraft, and certain real estate by July 31, 2005. Pepco Holdings does not believe that this requirement will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. Issuance of Common Stock In December 2002, Pepco Holdings sold 5,750,000 shares of common stock at $19.13 per share. Proceeds received on the transaction, net of issuance costs of $4.3 million, were $105.7 million. All of the proceeds were used to pay down outstanding commercial paper. Financing On June 25, 2002, CBI entered into a Credit Agreement (CBI Credit Agreement) with various banks and financial institutions. CBI is constructing new mid merit power plants in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Under the CBI Credit Agreement, CBI may borrow up to $365 million as a construction loan and convert the construction loan to a term loan after completing construction of the two 545 MW combined cycle power plants (CBI Project). Borrowings under the CBI Credit Agreement are secured by a lien on CBI and all tangible, intangible, and real property of CBI. As of December 31, 2002, the balance of CBIs outstanding borrowings under the CBI Credit Agreement was $161.8 million (5.4% effective interest rate). CBI expects to convert the construction loan to a term loan on one of the following dates: February 27, 2004, April 30, 2004, June 30, 2004, August 31, 2004 or September 30, 2004 (the actual date on which the construction loan is converted is refe rred to herein as the Term Loan Conversion Date), as provided for in the CBI Credit Agreement. CBI is required to repay any portion of the construction loan not converted to a term loan at the Term Loan Conversion Date or no later than September 30, 2004. Four semi annual principal payments begin six months after the Term Loan Conversion Date. Depending on the Term Loan Conversion Date, the amount of the term loan principal, which is repaid by the total of the four semi annual payments, is approximately 12.89% to 14.7%. The remaining principal of the term loan (and any unpaid accrued interest or fees) is due upon the loans maturity, which is the later of June 25, 2006, or the second anniversary of the Term Loan Conversion Date. On July 15, 2002, Pepco redeemed $66.2 million 8.50% First Mortgage Bonds due May 15, 2027 at a call price of 103.21%. The redemption totaled $69.3 million. Pepco Holdings entered into a $1.1 billion short term bridge facility on August 1, 2002 and borrowed the full amount to fund $700 million of the merger cash consideration, and repay commercial paper and Conectiv bank loans due upon merger closing. The facility was repaid in full on September 6, 2002 with proceeds from Pepco Holdings note offering. On August 1, 2002, Pepco Holdings, Pepco, DPL, and ACE established a $1.5 billion 364 day revolving credit facility with various financial institutions. Pepco Holdings borrowing sublimit under the agreement is $1 billion. Pepco, DPL, and ACE have an aggregate sublimit of $500 million, with no individual borrower entitled to borrow more than $300 million. The $1.5 billion facility includes a $300 million letter of credit sublimit. As of December 31, 2002, $103 million in letters of credit were outstanding. The facility will primarily be used to back up the commercial paper programs, which are discussed herein. Pepco Holdings established a $1 billion commercial paper program effective August 1, 2002. This program replaced the Conectiv and PCI commercial paper programs, which were terminated at the end of August 2002. Pepco, DPL, and ACE have $300 million, $275 million, and $250 million commercial paper programs, respectively. On September 3, 2002, Pepco redeemed $2 million or 40,000 shares of its $3.40 Serial Preferred Stock Series of 1992, pursuant to mandatory sinking fund provisions. On September 6, 2002, Pepco Holdings issued $1.35 billion of unsecured notes: $350 million of 5.50% notes due August 15, 2007, $750 million of 6.45% notes due August 15, 2012, and $250 million of 7.45% notes due August 15, 2032. The net proceeds from the offering totaled $1.34 billion. Pepco Holdings offered the notes in an unregistered transaction. The proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to repay approximately $1.1 billion of indebtedness outstanding under a short term bridge facility entered into on August 1, 2002 in connection with the merger, and to repay approximately $240 million of Pepco Holdings outstanding commercial paper, including approximately $106.1 million of commercial paper issued to fund the settlement of treasury lock transactions entered into in June 2002 in anticipation of the offering of the notes. On September 19, 2002, Pepco Holdings issued an additional $150 million of the 5.5% notes due August 15, 2007 (which were consolidated to form a single series with the $350 million 5.5% notes due 2007, issued by Pepco Holdings on September 6). The net proceeds from the offering totaled $151.7 million. Pepco Holdings offered the notes in an unregistered transaction. The proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to repay outstanding commercial paper. The Company is obligated to cause an exchange offer of notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933 with identical terms to the notes issued on September 6 and 19, 2002 to be consummated by June 3, 2003. On September 20, 2002, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) issued a Bondable Stranded Costs Rate Order (Financing Order) to ACE authorizing the issuance of $440 million of Transition Bonds. A subsidiary of ACE issued Transition Bonds totaling $440 million on December 19, 2002, in accordance with this Financing Order. The proceeds of these bonds will be used to recover the stranded costs associated with the divestiture of the ACE nuclear assets, the buyout of the Pedricktown NUG contract and the buy down of the American Ref Fuel NUG contract. Also included in the amount authorized was $20 million of transaction costs and capital reduction costs. On October 1, 2002, DPL redeemed at maturity $30 million of 6.95% First Mortgage Bonds and $12 million of 6.59% Medium Term Notes. On November 15, 2002, DPL redeemed at maturity $3 million of its 9.26% Medium Term Notes A and $1 million of its 9.29% Medium Term Notes A. On December 19, 2002, ACE redeemed at maturity a term loan in the amount of $171.4 million. On December 30, 2002, DPL redeemed at par 316,500 shares of its $25 par preferred stock with an annual dividend rate of 7.75%. On January 15, 2003, Pepco Holdings issued $300 million of 3.75% notes due February 15, 2006. The net proceeds from the offering totaled $298.4 million. The Company used the proceeds to redeem a $200 million Conectiv Floating Rate Note with an original maturity of February 28, 2003, that was called on January 28, 2003, and to repay outstanding commercial paper. On February 28, 2003, ACE redeemed 2,800,000 shares of 8.25% cumulative quarterly income preferred stock of Atlantic Capital I at $25 per share plus accrued and unpaid interest. ACE will redeem on March 24, 2003, Secured Medium Term Notes totaling $58 million with interest rates ranging from 7.125% to 7.98%. Money Pool Pepco Holdings has received PUHCA authorization to establish the Pepco Holdings System money pool. Certain direct and indirect subsidiaries of Pepco Holdings are eligible to participate in the money pool. Eligible subsidiaries with surplus cash may deposit those funds in the money pool. Eligible subsidiaries with cash deficits may borrow from the money pool. Pepco Holdings deposits funds in the money pool to the extent that the pool has insufficient funds to meet the borrowing needs of its participants. Pepco Holdings may not borrow from the money pool. Borrowings from the money pool are unsecured. Deposits in the money pool are guaranteed by Pepco Holdings. Depositors in the money pool receive and borrowers from the money pool pay an interest rate based primarily on Pepco Holdings short term borrowing rate. Pepco Holdings external borrowing requirement fluctuates based on the amount of funds deposited in the money pool. Pension Funding Pepco and Conectivs pension assets did not achieve the level of returns assumed in the determination of their pension expense accruals during 2002. As a result, Pepco contributed $35 million to its pension plan in December 2002 to exceed a funding level of 100% with respect to its accrued benefit obligation. Conectivs pension plan did not require a contribution in December 2002 to exceed 100% of its accrued benefit obligation. Pepco contributed $25 million to its pension plan in 2001 and $50 million in 2000. Effective December 31, 2002, as a result of the August 1, 2002 Pepco and Conectiv merger, the Pepco General Retirement Plan and the Conectiv Retirement Plan were merged into the Pepco Holdings Retirement Plan. Pepco Holdings adopted the Pepco and Conectiv benefit plans. The provisions and benefits of the merged plan are identical to those of the original Pepco and Conectiv Plans. As of January 1, 2002, Pepco and Conectivs individual plan actuarial valuations incorporated different assumptions for the 2002 year net periodic expense determination. Pepco Holdings expects to review, and may change the actuarial assumptions of the plan for 2003. Due to lower asset values than expected in its pension plan and the potential need to modify the assumptions used to value its pension liabilities, Pepco Holdings could experience a substantially higher level of pension expense in the near term and until the investment return of the plan assets improves. Shareholder Dividend Reinvestment Plan and Employee Benefit Plans Under the Companys Shareholder Dividend Reinvestment Plan and under various employee benefit plans of the Company and its subsidiaries, the Company can satisfy its obligations to supply Company common stock for the plans either by selling newly issued shares to the plans or by contributing cash that the plan administrators then use to purchase common stock in the open market. From August 1, 2002 to December 31, 2002, the Company issued an aggregate of approximately 630,000 shares of its common stock to fund its obligations under the plans. Dividend Policy and Restrictions The Companys annual dividend rate on its common stock is determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration, among other factors, current and possible future developments which may affect the Companys income and cash flows. The Companys Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend per share of common stock of 25 cents payable on December 31, 2002 to holders of record on December 10, 2002. Previously, the Board declared a "pro rata" period dividend of $.16576079 per share following the August 1 merger which was paid September 30, 2002 to holders of record on September 10, 2002. Under PUHCA, Pepco Holdings may not pay dividends on the shares of common stock from an accumulated deficit or paid in capital without SEC approval. Pepco Holdings common dividends paid to stockholders are currently funded from the common dividends that Pepco, DPL, and ACE pay to Pepco Holdings. Under PUHCA, Pepco, DPL, and ACE are prohibited from paying a dividend from an accumulated deficit or paid in capital, unless SEC approval is obtained. Also, the certificates of incorporation of Pepco, DPL, and ACE have certain other limitations on the payment of common dividends to Pepco Holdings. Working Capital At December 31, 2002, current assets totaled $1.7 billion versus current liabilities of $2.6 billion. Current liabilities include $406.3 million in long term debt due within one year. Although the Company currently has in place a $1.5 billion working capital facility, it intends to lower its current liabilities over the next twelve months through a combination of long term financing strategies. Construction Expenditures Pepco Holdings construction expenditures totaled $503.8 million in 2002. For the five year period 2003 through 2007, construction expenditures are projected to total approximately $2.2 billion, of which approximately $1.7 billion is related to the regulated power delivery business.

On November 19, 2002, the CCRO released white papers representing recommended best practices in four areas of risk management for its membership of 31 merchant energy companies. Conectiv Energy and Pepco Energy Services are members of the CCRO. The white papers that were issued included a series of additional risk management disclosures in tabular format. The CCRO recommended that merchant energy companies include these tabular disclosures in Securities and Exchange Commission filings beginning in the first calendar quarter of 2003. The following tables present the combined risk management disclosures of Conectiv Energy and Pepco Energy Services for the year ended December 31, 2002. Information presented in the accompanying tables includes Conectiv Energy data for the five post merger months of August 2002 through December 2002, combined with Pepco Energy Services data for the entire year. Forward looking data represents 100% of the combined positions of Conectiv Energy and Pepco Energy Services.

Table 8 Value at Risk ("VaR") Associated with Energy Contracts For the Year Ended December 31, 2002 (Dollars in Millions) Pepco Holdings uses a value at risk model to assess the market risk of its electricity, gas, coal, and petroleum product commodity activities. The model includes physical forward contracts used for hedging and trading, and commodity derivative instruments. Value at risk represents the potential gain or loss on instruments or portfolios due to changes in market factors, for a specified time period and confidence level. Pepco Holdings estimates value at risk across its power, gas, coal, and petroleum products commodity business using a delta gamma variance/covariance model with a 95 percent, one tailed confidence level and assuming a one day holding period. Since value at risk is an estimate, it is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur.

Note that these methods of conversion are not valid for converting from 5 day or less holding periods to over 1 month holding periods and should not be applied to "non standard closed form" VaR calculations in any case. REGULATORY AND OTHER MATTERS Termination of Agreements for Sale of ACE Electric Generating Plants Under the terms of agreements between ACE and NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG) for the sale of ACEs fossil fuel fired electric generating plants (Deepwater Station, Conemaugh and Keystone Stations and B.L. England Station) the agreements were subject to termination by either party after February 28, 2002. NRG delivered notice to Conectiv on April 1, 2002 terminating these agreements. On January 13, 2003, the Company announced the termination of a second competitive bidding process initiated on May 23, 2002 to sell these ACE owned fossil fuel fired electric generating plants. The Company noted that while the competitive bidding process identified a number of interested parties, current conditions in the electric energy market prevented ACE from reaching agreements for the sale of these generating assets. The Company remains interested in selling these assets on acceptable terms, but cannot predict whether or not any or all of the plants will be sold, whe ther the NJBPU will grant the required approval of any sales agreements, or any related impacts upon recoverable stranded costs. Basic Generation Service Under the provisions of New Jerseys 1999 Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act (the New Jersey Act) and the NJBPUs Final Decision and Order concerning restructuring ACEs electric utility business, ACE was obligated to provide Basic Generation Service (BGS) through July 31, 2002, which entailed supplying electricity to customers in ACEs service area who do not choose an alternative supplier. The Final Decision and Order provides for the recovery through customer rates of the costs incurred by ACE in providing BGS, including an allowed return on certain electric generating plants, the above market portion of the cost of power purchased from NUGs, and the above market portion of costs associated with generating power for BGS customers. In recognition of this cost based, rate recovery mechanism, when the costs incurred by ACE in providing BGS exceed the revenues from billings to ACEs customers for BGS, the under recovered costs are defe rred as a regulatory asset. Pursuant to the terms of the 1999 restructuring of ACEs electric generation business, during 2000 2002, the under recovered costs were first applied to a deferred energy cost liability that was eliminated and then a regulatory asset was established ($153.0 million as of December 31, 2002). After the initial four year transition period ends July 31, 2003, customer rates are to be adjusted to recover the under recovered cost balance over a reasonable period of time to be determined by the NJBPU. ACEs recovery of the deferred costs is subject to review by the NJBPU. On August 1, 2002, in accordance with the provisions of the New Jersey Act and the NJBPUs Final Decision and Order, ACE petitioned the NJBPU for a $71.6 million, or 8.4%, annualized increase in electric rates, effective August 1, 2003. This proposed rate increase is intended to recover ACEs deferred cost balance as of August 1, 2003 over a four year period and reset ACEs rates such that an under recovery of certain costs is no longer embedded in rates. ACEs recovery of the deferred costs is subject to review by the NJBPU, which will determine the amount of cost recovery in accordance with the New Jersey Act. The outside auditing firm selected by the NJBPU has completed its review and audit of the deferral balance of ACE. A draft report has been provided to ACE, and ACE has responded to the NJBPU and the auditors with factual comments. A final report was released on February 24, 2003. BGS electricity supply beyond July 31, 2002 was provided for by a BGS auction held in February 2002, which awarded about 1,900 MW, or 80% of ACEs BGS load to four suppliers for the period from August 1, 2002 to July 31, 2003. The remaining 20% of ACEs BGS load is supplied utilizing ACEs electric supply, consisting of its fossil fuel fired electric generating plants (excluding Deepwater), which are used first to meet such BGS load, and its NUG contracts, to the extent such electric generating plants are not sufficient to satisfy such load. Any portion of ACEs electric supply that exceeds the load requirement of the BGS customers is sold in the wholesale market. In addition, if any of the four suppliers awarded 80% of ACEs BGS load default on performance, ACE will offer the defaulted load to the other winning bidders. If they are not interested, ACE will then procure the needed supply from the wholesale market. Any costs related to this new supply that are not covered by remuneration from the supplier in default will be included in the calculation of deferred electric service costs, which are subject to NJBPU review and future recovery in customer rate increases. By Decision and Order dated December 18, 2002, the NJBPU approved the process for the procurement of BGS supply for the period starting August 1, 2003. The decision included holding two separate but simultaneous auctions to procure BGS supply. The first auction will be for the supply needed to serve large commercial and industrial customers who will be paying an hourly energy price. There are approximately 50 customers in this group for ACE. The auction will determine the capacity price to be paid by these customers. The period covered by this auction is August 1, 2003 through May 31, 2004. The second auction will be for the supply needs of the remainder of the BGS customers, and would be for full requirements service (energy, capacity, transmission, and ancillary services) for these customers. In this auction, two thirds of the needs will be procured for the same period as the first auction, while the remaining one third of the needs will be p rocured for a period of 34 months. The results of these auctions will be used to set the rates paid by the customers in each group. The decision also established working groups to deal with metering issues and customer education. The auctions were conducted February 3 and 4, 2003. The NJBPU approved the results of the auctions on February 5, 2003. ACE has entered into BGS Supplier Agreements with the winning bidders. If any of the winning bidders were to default on their commitments, ACE will offer the defaulted load to other winning bidders, or will make arrangements to purchase the needed supply from PJM administered markets. Securitization Under the New Jersey Act, up to 100% of recovery eligible stranded costs related to electric generating plants and the costs to affect buyouts or buy downs of NUG contracts may be recovered through customer rates. On September 9, 2002, New Jersey enacted an amendment (Amendment) to the New Jersey Act. The Amendment permits the NJBPU to authorize the securitization of deferred balances of electric public utilities resulting from the provisions of the New Jersey Act. The NJBPU may authorize the issuance of transition bonds by an electric public utility or other financing entity in order to (i) recover stranded costs deemed eligible for rate recovery in a stranded cost recovery order; (ii) recover rate reduction requirements determined by the NJBPU to be necessary under the provisions of the New Jersey Act; or (iii) recover basic generation service transition costs. The NJBPU may approve transition bonds with scheduled amortization of up to fiftee n years if related to stranded cost recoveries or recoveries of basic generation service transition costs, or the remaining term of a purchase power agreement if related to the buyout or buy down of long term purchase power contracts with NUGs. On September 20, 2002, the NJBPU issued a Bondable Stranded Costs Rate Order (Financing Order) to ACE authorizing the issuance of $440 million of Transition Bonds. A subsidiary of ACE issued Transition Bonds totaling $440 million on December 19, 2002, in accordance with this Financing Order. The proceeds of these bonds will be used to recover the stranded costs associated with the divestiture of the ACE nuclear assets, the buyout of the Pedricktown NUG contract and the buy down of the American Ref Fuel NUG contract. Also included in the amount authorized was $20 million of transaction costs and capital reduction costs. ACE formed ACE Transition Funding during 2001 as a special purpose entity (SPE) for the sole purpose of purchasing and owning the bondable transition property (BTP), issuing transition bonds (Bonds), pledging ACE Transition Fundings interest in BTP and other collateral to the bond trustee to collateralize the Bonds, and performing activities that are necessary, suitable or convenient to accomplish these purposes. Proceeds from the sale of Bonds were transferred to ACE in consideration for the BTP, and ACE will repurchase debt and or equity related to the stranded costs and NUG contracts noted above. The Bonds of ACE Transition Funding are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. On January 31, 2003, ACE filed a petition seeking from the NJBPU an administrative valuation of a portion of the B.L. England Station stranded costs and a finding that such costs may be included as part of the principal amount of transition bonds for which ACE may seek approval under the New Jersey Act. Management anticipates that the necessary approvals will be received from the NJBPU and that a bondable stranded costs rate petition will ultimately be approved, leading to the issuance of additional transition bonds. Rate Increase On February 3, 2003, ACE filed a petition with the NJBPU to increase its electric distribution rates and the Regulatory Asset Recovery Charge in New Jersey. The request, if approved, will increase ACEs annual revenues by approximately $68.4 million. The petition was filed in accordance with the NJBPUs Final Order in restructuring, which mandated that ACE file a plan to set rates that will be in place when the New Jersey Acts transition period ends July 31, 2003. Pepco Regulatory Contingencies Final briefs on Pepcos District of Columbia divestiture proceeds sharing application were filed on July 31, 2002 following an evidentiary hearing in June 2002. That application was filed to implement a provision of Pepcos D.C. Commission approved divestiture settlement that provided for a sharing of any net proceeds from the sale of its generation related assets. A principal issue in the case is whether a sharing between customers and shareholders of the excess deferred income taxes and accumulated deferred investment tax credits associated with the sold assets would violate the normalization provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and implementing regulations. On March 4, 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) that could be relevant to that principal issue. Comments on the NOPR must be filed by June 2, 2003, and the IRS will hold a public hearing on June 2, 2003. Pepco cannot predict whether th e IRS will adopt the regulations as proposed, make changes before issuing final regulations or decide not to adopt regulations. Other issues deal with the inclusion of internal costs and cost allocations. Pepco believes that its calculation of the customers share of divestiture proceeds is correct. However, the potential exists that Pepco could be required to make additional gain sharing payments to D.C. customers. Such additional payments, which cannot be estimated, would be charged to expense and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the quarter and year in which a decision is rendered; however, Pepco does not believe that additional payments, if any, will have a material adverse impact on its financial position. It is impossible to predict when the D.C. Commission will issue a decision. Pepco filed its divestiture proceeds plan application in Maryland in April 2001. Reply briefs were filed in May 2002 and Pepco is awaiting a Proposed Order from the Hearing Examiner. It is a certainty that some party or parties will appeal the Hearing Examiners Proposed Order to the Maryland Commission. The principal issue in the case is the same normalization issue that was raised in the D.C. case. On March 4, 2003, the IRS issued a NOPR that could be relevant to that principal issue. Comments on the NOPR must be filed by June 2, 2003, and the IRS will hold a public hearing on June 2, 2003. Pepco cannot predict whether the IRS will adopt the regulations as proposed, make changes before issuing final regulations or decide not to adopt regulations. Other issues deal with the inclusion of internal costs and cost allocations. Pepco believes that its calculation of the customers share of divestiture proceeds is correct. However, the potential als o exists that Pepco would be required to make additional gain sharing payments to Maryland customers. Such additional payments, which cannot be estimated, would be charged to expense and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the quarter and year in which a decision is rendered; however, Pepco does not believe that additional payments, if any, will have a material adverse impact on its financial position. It is impossible to predict when the Hearing Examiner or the Maryland Commission will issue their decisions. In Maryland, in accordance with the terms of an agreement approved by the Maryland Commission, customers who are unable to receive generation services from another supplier, or who do not select another supplier, are entitled to receive services from Pepco until July 1, 2004 (Standard Offer Service or SOS). Pepco has entered into a settlement in Phase I of Maryland Case No. 8908 to extend its provision of SOS services in Maryland. The Settlement is awaiting approval from the Maryland Commission. The Settlement provides for an extension of SOS for four years for residential and small commercial customers, an extension of two years for medium sized commercial customers, and an extension of one year for large commercial customers. The settlement provides for a policy review by the Commission to consider how SOS will be provided after the current extension expires. The Settlement provides for SOS to be procured from the wholesale marketplace and th at Pepco will be able to recover its costs of procurement and a return. Full Requirements Contract with Mirant Under a full requirements contract entered into in 2000 in connection with the purchase by Mirant Corporation of substantially all of Pepcos electricity generation assets, Mirant is obligated to supply Pepco with all of the capacity and energy needed to fulfill these default service obligations at fixed prices that are lower than currently approved tariff rates that Pepco charges for providing such service. If Mirant were to fail to fulfill its supply obligations, Pepco would have to find alternative sources of supply at rates then prevailing. Environmental Matters The Company through its subsidiaries is subject to regulation with respect to the environmental effects of their operations, including air and water quality control, solid and hazardous waste disposal, and limitations on land use by various federal, regional, state, and local authorities. Federal and state statutes authorize governmental agencies to compel responsible parties to clean up certain abandoned or uncontrolled hazardous waste sites. The Companys subsidiaries may incur costs to clean up facilities found to be contaminated due to current and past disposal practices. The Companys subsidiaries liability for clean up costs is affected by the activities of these governmental agencies and private land owners, the nature of past disposal practices, the activities of others (including whether they are able to contribute to clean up costs), and the scientific and other complexities involved in resolving clean up related issues (including wh ether a Pepco Holdings subsidiary or a corporate predecessor is responsible for conditions on a particular parcel). The Companys current liabilities include approximately $22.7 million as of December 31, 2002, for potential clean up and other costs related to sites at which a Conectiv subsidiary is a potentially responsible party, alleged to be a third party contributor, or has made a decision to clean up contamination on its own property. The accrued liability as of December 31, 2002, included $11.2 million for remediation and other costs associated with environmental contamination that resulted from an oil release at the Indian River power plant (which was sold on June 22, 2001) and reflects the terms of a related consent agreement reached with the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control during 2001. As a result of discontinuing the second competitive bidding process for ACEs fossil fuel fired generating stations, ACEs anticipated $7 million costs to clean up the Deepwater gen erating station is included in the previously stated $22.7 million liability. The costs of cleaning up ACEs B.L. England generating station have not yet been quantified but may exceed $2 million. The Company does not expect such future costs to have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In April 2002, EPA proposed regulations addressing best technology available for minimizing environmental impact from existing power production cooling water intake structures. The ACE Deepwater electric generating stations New Jersey Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) renewal permit, effective through September 30, 2007 will require a study to evaluate the efficiency of recent changes to the intake structure and other biological impact studies that will be submitted with a permit renewal application in 2007. The NJPDES permit for the B.L. England Station expired in December 1999, but has been administratively extended, through submittal of a renewal application, and the plant continues to operate under the conditions of the existing permit until a renewal permit is issued by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). A Conectiv subsidiary holds a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for the Edge Moor Power Plant. Studies to determine impacts on aquatic organisms by the plants intake structures, required by the existing permit which expires in October 2003, were completed in 2002. The results of these studies and additional site specific studies on alternative technologies are expected to determine whether changes to intake structures are required to comply with any final rule that EPA adopts. On May 4, 2002, ACE, Conectiv Atlantic Generation, LLC (CAG), and the NJDEP entered into an Administrative Consent Order (ACO) to address ACEs and CAGs inability to procure Discrete Emission Reductions (DER) credits to comply with New Jerseys NOx Reasonable Available Control Technology (RACT) requirements and NJDEPs allegations that ACE had failed to comply with DER credit use restrictions from 1996 to 2001. The ACO eliminates requirements for ACE and CAG to purchase DER credits for certain ACE and CAG electric generating units through May 1, 2005 and provides, among other things, for installation of new controls on CAGs electric generating units ($7 million estimated cost), a $1.0 million penalty, a $1.0 million contribution to promote, develop and enhance an urban airshed reforestation project, and operating hour limits at ACEs Deepwater Unit N o. 4. On July 11, 2001, the NJDEP denied ACEs request to renew a permit variance, effective through July 30, 2001, that authorized Unit 1 at the B.L. England station to burn coal containing greater than 1% sulfur. ACE has appealed the denial. The NJDEP has issued a number of stays of the denial to authorize ACE to operate Unit 1 with the current fuel until May 29, 2003. NJDEP also issued addendums to the permit/certificate to operate for Unit 1 authorizing trial burns of coal with a sulfur content less than 2.6%. ACE is requesting an extension of the current stay of the denial and submitted final wrap up reports on the results of its test burns to NJDEP on January 28, 2003. Management is not able to predict the outcome of ACEs appeal, including the effects, if any, of trial burn results on NJDEPs position with regard to the denial or the appeal. In February 2000, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and NJDEP requested information from ACE regarding the operation of coal fired boilers at ACEs B.L. England and Deepwater generating stations. As of December 2002, in responding to this request and numerous subsequent requests, ACE has provided more than 24,000 pages of documents covering activities at B.L. England and Deepwater since 1978 to USEPA and NJDEP. USEPA has sought this information pursuant to its authority under Clean Air Act Section 114, and the ACE requests are similar to those that USEPA has made of other electric utilities to determine compliance with New Source Review (NSR) Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and non attainment NSR requirements. Similar inquiries have resulted in the filing of federal lawsuits against utilities in the South and Midwest. A number of settlements of litigation brought as a result of such inquiries alleging viola tions of NSR standards have been announced. In January 2002, the Department of Justice completed its review of the USEPAs enforcement actions and concluded that the USEPA has a reasonable basis on which to pursue NSR enforcement. On December 31, 2002, EPA published an NSR reform package including both proposed and final rules. The proposed rule offers options for clarifying the routine maintenance, repair and replacement exclusion to the NSR rules. It is unclear how EPAs proposed reform rules will ultimately impact the on going NSR enforcement actions; however, EPA officials have indicated their intention to continue with the NSR enforcement initiative targeting alleged past violations under the current rules. ACE met with EPA and NJDEP in May 2002 to discuss NSR issues. Since then, ACE entered into a confidentiality agreement with the government agencies. The Company does not believe that it has violated NSR requirements. Management cannot predict the impact of the USEPA/NJDEP inquiries or proposal on B.L . England or Deepwater operations. In October 1995, Pepco received notice from the EPA that it, along with several hundred other companies, may be a potentially responsible party (PRP) in connection with the Spectron Superfund Site located in Elkton, Maryland. The site was operated as a hazardous waste disposal, recycling, and processing facility from 1961 to 1988. In August 2001, Pepco entered into a Consent Decree for de minimis parties with EPA to resolve its liability at this site. Pursuant to the consent decree, in return for a de minimis payment by Pepco to the United States and a group of PRPs, those parties covenant not to sue Pepco for past and future costs of remediation at the site and the United States will also provide contribution protection against third party claims related to response actions at the site. Natural resource damages, if any, are not covered by the Consent Decree. Court approval of the Consent Decree is pending. Pepco believes that its liability at this site, pursuant to the terms of the Consent Decree, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. In June 1992, EPA identified ACE as a PRP at the Bridgeport Rental and Oil Services (BROS) superfund site in Logan Township, New Jersey. In September 1996, ACE along with other PRPs signed a consent decree with EPA and NJDEP to address remediation of the Site. ACEs liability is limited to 0.232 percent and ACE has made contributions of approximately $105,000. The Phase 2 Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) to address groundwater and wetlands contamination is scheduled to be completed in September 2003. ACE believes that its liability at this site will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. In November 1991, NJDEP identified ACE as a PRP at the Delilah Road Landfill site in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey. In 1993, ACE, along with other PRPs, signed an Administrative Consent Order (ACO) with NJDEP to remediate the Site. The soil cap remedy for the Site has been completed and the NJDEP conditionally approved the Remedial Action Report in January 2003. The results of groundwater monitoring over the next year will help to determine the extent of post remedy operation and maintenance costs. In December 1987, Pepco was notified by the EPA that it, along with several other utilities and nonutilities, is a PRP in connection with the polychlorinated biphenyl compounds (PCBs) contamination of a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, site owned by a nonaffiliated company. In the early 1970s, Pepco sold scrap transformers, some of which may have contained some level of PCBs, to a metal reclaimer operating at the site. In October 1994, a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) including a number of possible remedies was submitted to the EPA. In December 1997, the EPA signed a ROD that set forth a selected remedial action plan with estimated implementation costs of approximately $17 million. In June 1998, the EPA issued a unilateral Administrative Order to Pepco and 12 other PRPs to conduct the design and actions called for in the ROD. At December 31, 2002, Pepco has accrued $1.7 million for its share of these costs. The Company be lieves that its liability at this site will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. Pepcos Benning Service Center facility operates under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. The EPA issued an NPDES permit for this facility in November 2000. Pepco has filed a petition with the EPA Environmental Appeals Board seeking review and reconsideration of certain provisions of the EPAs permit determination. In May 2001, Pepco and the EPA reached a settlement on Pepcos petition, pursuant to which the EPA withdrew certain contested provisions of the permit and agreed to issue a revised draft permit for public comment. As of December 31, 2002, the EPA has not issued a revised permit and Pepco is operating pursuant to the November 2000 permit absent the withdrawn conditions in accordance with the settlement agreement. In the late 1980s DPL was identified by EPA as a PRP at the Spectron Superfund Site located in Elkton, Maryland. The site was operated as a hazardous waste disposal, recycling, and processing facility from 1961 to 1988. The PRP Group determined that in 1987 and 1988 DPL sent 440 gallons of waste paint to the site. DPL paid $290.40 in connection with a Consent Agreement as a Non Performing Settling Party to resolve its liability for Phase I activities at the site. In September 1991, DPL made an additional $500 payment pursuant to a second Administrative Consent Order initiating Phase II activities. The site was added to the National Priorities List in 1994. In February 2003, the PRP Group informed DPL that DPL was a de micromis party at the Site because its 440 gallon contribution to the Site was less than EPAs 890 gallon threshold for de minimis status and that DPL has no further liability for contribution to the Sites remediation fund. In the late 1980s, DPL was notified by the EPA that it, along with several other utilities and nonutilities was a PRP in connection with the polychlorinated biphenyl compounds (PCBs) contamination at the Metal Bank/Cottman Avenue site located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at which the Site owner, from 1968 to 1972, drained oil from used transformers to reclaim copper. Based on the PRP groups determination that DPL sent 102 transformers to the Site, DPL was allocated responsibility for 0.24 percent of remediation costs. In October 1994, a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) including a number of possible remedies was submitted to the EPA. In December 1997, the EPA signed a Record of Decision (ROD) that set forth a selected remedial action plan with estimated implementation costs of approximately $17 million. In 1999, DPL entered into a de minimis settlement with EPA and paid approximately $107,000 to resolve its liability for clea nup costs at the Site. The de minimis settlement did not resolve DPLs responsibility for natural resource damages, if any, at the Site. DPL believes that its liability at this site will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. Litigation During 1993, Pepco was served with Amended Complaints filed in three jurisdictions (Prince Georges County, Baltimore City and Baltimore County), in separate ongoing, consolidated proceedings each denominated, "In re: Personal Injury Asbestos Case." Pepco (and other defendants) were brought into these cases on a theory of premises liability under which plaintiffs argue that Pepco was negligent in not providing a safe work environment for employees or its contractors who allegedly were exposed to asbestos while working on Pepcos property. Initially, a total of approximately 448 individual plaintiffs added Pepco to their Complaints. While the pleadings are not entirely clear, it appears that each plaintiff seeks $2 million in compensatory damages and $4 million in punitive damages from each defendant. In a related proceeding in the Baltimore City case, Pepco was served, in September 1993, with a third party complaint by Owens Corning Fiberglass, Inc. (Owens Corning) alleging that Owens Corning was in the process of settling approximately 700 individual asbestos related cases and seeking a judgment for contribution against Pepco on the same theory of alleged negligence set forth above in the plaintiffs case. Subsequently, Pittsburgh Corning Corp. (Pittsburgh Corning) filed a third party complaint against Pepco, seeking contribution for the same plaintiffs involved in the Owens Corning third party complaint. Since the initial filings in 1993, approximately 90 additional individual suits have been filed against Pepco. The third party complaints involving Pittsburgh Corning and Owens Corning were dismissed by the Baltimore City Court during 1994 without any payment by Pepco. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 200 cases were pending against Pepco. Of the 200 remaining asbestos cases pending against Pepco, approximately 35 of those cases have been tendered to Mirant for defense and indemnification pursuant to the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement wh ich was executed in December 2000. While the aggregate amount specified in the remaining suits would exceed $400 million, Pepco believes the amounts are greatly exaggerated, as were the claims already disposed of. The amount of total liability, if any, and any related insurance recovery cannot be precisely determined at this time; however, based on information and relevant circumstances known at this time, the Company does not believe these suits will have a material adverse effect on its financial position. However, an unfavorable decision rendered against Pepco could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the year in which a decision is rendered. On April 7, 2000, approximately 139,000 gallons of oil leaked from a pipeline at a generation station that was owned by Pepco at Chalk Point in Aquasco, Maryland. The pipeline was operated by Support Terminals Services Operating Partnership LP, an unaffiliated pipeline management company. The oil spread from Swanson Creek to the Patuxent River and several of its tributaries. The area affected covers portions of 17 miles of shoreline along the Patuxent River and approximately 45 acres of marshland adjacent to the Chalk Point property. As a result of the oil spill, eleven class action lawsuits and two additional lawsuits on behalf of a number of Southern Maryland residents, businesses and watermen were filed against Pepco. On November 27, 2001, Pepco and ST Services entered into a Settlement Agreement with the various plaintiffs to settle all pending class action litigation stemming from the oil spill. Under the Settlement Agreement, a total of $ 2.25 million was placed in an escrow account to be distributed to watermen and property owner class members pursuant to a Plan of Distribution filed with the Court. On December 27, 2001, the Court entered an "Order Certifying Settlement Classes and Preliminarily Approving Proposed Settlement," which was approved in April 2002. In April 2002, the Claims Administrator provided the Court with a list of those members of the Settlement Classes which had timely excluded themselves from the Settlement Agreement. Approximately 80 class members elected to exclude themselves from the terms of the November 27, 2001 Settlement Agreement. On December 2, 2001, Enron North America Corp. and several of its affiliates filed for protection under the United States Bankruptcy Code. In December 2001, DPL and Conectiv Energy Supply, Inc. (CESI) terminated all transactions under various agreements with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (EPMI and, together with Enron North America Corp., Enron). In late January 2003, after several months of discussions attempting to arrive at a settlement with Enron concerning the amount owed by Delmarva and CESI, EPMI filed an adversary complaint (the Complaint) against CESI in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The Complaint seeks an order from the Bankruptcy Court that, among other things, (1) awards damages in the amount of approximately $11.7 million, plus interest and attorneys fees and additional damages (in an amount to be determined at trial), (2) declares unenforceable the provision s of the master power purchase and sale agreement (MPPSA) between CESI and EPMI that permitted CESI to set off against any amounts CESI owes EPMI under the MPPSA any amounts due by EPMI or any of its affiliates to CESI or any of its affiliates under any agreements among EPMI or any of its affiliates and CESI and any of its affiliates, and (3) declares that the arbitration provision in the MPPSA should not be enforced. CESI disagrees with Enrons calculation of the amount due (CESIs calculations result in an amount due of approximately $3.8 million) and believes that Enrons other claims are without merit. CESIs response to the Complaint is due on April 7, 2003. At the present time, it is not possible to predict the outcome of this suit or to estimate with specificity the amount that CESI will ultimately pay Enron; however, based on, among other factors, the specific provisions in the applicable contracts of the Conectiv subsidiaries with Enron and applicable legal principles, Management does not believe that the Company has material financial exposure related to the Enron bankruptcy. The Company, through its subsidiaries, is involved in other legal and administrative (including environmental) proceedings before various courts and agencies with respect to matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Management is of the opinion that the final disposition of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Third Party Guarantees At December 31, 2002, Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries guaranteed $416.5 million of third party obligations. The detail of these guarantees is summarized below. Guarantor PHI Conectiv PCI Total (Dollars in Millions) Energy trading obligations of Conectiv Energy $ 80.7 $136.3 $217.0 Energy trading obligations of Pepco Energy Services 36.9 36.9 Construction performance guarantees 85.3 36.6 121.9 Other 28.2 12.5 40.7 Total $202.9 $201.1 $12.5 $416.5 Pepco Holdings and the above referenced significant subsidiaries guarantee payments to counter parties related to routine energy trading obligations, including requirements under BGS contracts for ACE. A portion of Conectivs Mid merit plant program and the energy management programs of Pepco Energy Services contains construction payment guarantees. Pepco Holdings also has investments in partnerships and joint ventures, which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries guarantee certain payment and performance obligations associated with these unconsolidated entities.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS POTOMAC ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY OVERVIEW On August 1, 2002, Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco or the Company) closed on its acquisition of Conectiv for a combination of cash and stock valued at approximately $2.2 billion. In accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, both Pepco and Conectiv became subsidiaries of Pepco Holdings, Inc. (Pepco Holdings) a registered holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. Pepco Holdings was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on February 9, 2001 for the purpose of effecting the merger. As part of the merger transaction, holders of Pepcos common stock immediately prior to the August 1, 2002 merger received in exchange for their Pepco shares approximately 107,125,976 shares of Pepco Holdings common stock, par value $.01 per share. Additionally, Pepco issued 100 shares of common stock, par value $.01, all of which is owned by Pepco Holdings. Since August 1, 2002, Pepco has been engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity in Washington, D.C. and major portions of Prince Georges and Montgomery Counties in suburban Maryland. Under settlements entered into with regulatory authorities, Pepco is required to provide electricity supply at specified rates (referred to as "default service") to customers in Maryland until July 2004 and to customers in Washington, D.C. until February 2005. Under a full requirements contract entered into in 2000 in connection with the purchase by Mirant Corporation (Mirant) of substantially all of Pepcos electricity generation assets, Mirant is obligated to supply Pepco with all of the capacity and energy needed to fulfill these default service obligations at fixed prices that are lower than currently approved tariff rates that Pepco charges for providing such service. If Mirant were to fail to fulfill its supply obligations, Pepco would hav e to find alternative sources of supply at rates then prevailing. Until August 1, 2002, Pepco was also engaged in the management of a diversified financial investments portfolio and the supply of energy products and services in competitive retail markets. These activities were performed through the Companys wholly owned unregulated subsidiary at that time, POM Holdings, Inc. (POM) which until August 1, 2002, was the parent company of two wholly owned subsidiaries, Potomac Capital Investment Corporation (PCI) and Pepco Energy Services, Inc. (Pepco Energy Services). PCI managed the Companys financial investment portfolio and Pepco Energy Services provided competitive energy products and services. PCIs investment in Starpower Communications, LLC, which provides cable and telecommunication services in the Washington, D.C. area, is owned by its wholly owned subsidiary Pepco Communications, Inc. (Pepcom). After the merger, the stock of PCI, Pepco Energy Services, and Pepcom was distributed as a dividend to P epco Holdings, which resulted in Pepco Holdings becoming the new parent company of PCI, Pepco Energy Services, and Pepcom. Additionally, Pepco has a wholly owned Delaware statutory business trust, Potomac Electric Power Company Trust I, and a wholly owned Delaware Investment Holding Company, Edison Capital Reserves Corporation. At December 31, 2002, Pepco had 2,442 total employees. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has defined a companys most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results of operations, and which require the Company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, Pepco has identified the critical accounting policies and judgments as addressed below. Accounting Policy Choices Pepcos management believes that based on the nature of its business it has very little choice regarding the accounting policies it utilize as Pepcos business consists of its regulated utility operations, which are subject to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71 "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." However, in the areas that Pepco is afforded accounting policy choices, management does not believe that the application of different accounting policies than those that it chose would materially impact its financial position or results of operations. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, such as Statement of Position 94 6 "Disclosure of Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties," requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Examples of estimates used by the Company include the calculation of the allowance for uncollectible accounts, environmental remediation costs and anticipated collections, unbilled revenue, and pension assumptions. Pepco believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable; they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Revenue Recognition Pepcos revenue for services rendered but unbilled as of the end of each month is accrued and included in the accounts receivable balance on the accompanying balance sheets. Accounting For the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation Based on the regulatory framework in which it has operated, Pepco has historically applied, and in connection with its transmission and distribution business continues to apply, the provisions of SFAS No. 71. SFAS No. 71 allows regulated entities, in appropriate circumstances, to establish regulatory assets and to defer the income statement impact of certain costs that are expected to be recovered in future rates. Managements assessment of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets requires judgment and interpretation of laws, regulatory commission orders, and other factors. Should existing facts or circumstances change in the future to indicate that a regulatory asset is not probable of recovery, and then the regulatory asset would be charged to earnings. Pension and Other Post Employment Benefit Plans Pepco Holdings has a noncontributory retirement plan (the Plan) that covers substantially all employees of Pepco, DPL, ACE, and certain employees of other Pepco Holdings subsidiaries. Following the consummation of the acquisition of Conectiv by Pepco on August 1, 2002, the Pepco General Retirement Plan and the Conectiv Retirement Plan were merged into the Plan on December 31, 2002. The provisions and benefits of the merged plan for Pepco employees are identical to those of the original Pepco plan and for DPL and ACE employees the provisions and benefits are identical to the original Conectiv plan. In addition to providing pension benefits, Pepco Holdings also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible employees (OPEBS). The Company accounts for the Plan in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" and its OPEBS in accordance with SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." The Companys financial statement disclosures were prepared in accordance with SFAS No. 132, "Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits." New Accounting Standards In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 143 entitled "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," which is required to be adopted for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002 (the Companys first quarter 2003 financial statements). This Statement establishes the accounting and reporting standards for measuring and recording asset retirement obligations. The Company has completed its assessment of the provisions of SFAS No. 143 and believes that although the implementation of the Statement will result in certain account reclassifications it will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections." SFAS No. 145 rescinds SFAS No. 4, "Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt (an amendment of APB Opinion No. 30)." SFAS No. 4 had required that material gains and losses on extinguishment of debt be classified as an extraordinary item. Under SFAS No. 145, SFAS No. 4 is rescinded effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. Due to the rescission of SFAS No. 4, it is less likely that a gain or loss on extinguishment of debt would be classified as an extraordinary item in Pepcos Consolidated Statements of Income. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, which requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when the costs are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The primary effect of applying SFAS No. 146 will be on the timing of recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities. In many cases, those costs will be recognized as liabilities in periods following a commitment to a plan, not at the date of the commitment. SFAS No. 146 is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" (FIN 45). FIN 45 requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, a guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee. Additional disclosures are also prescribed for certain guarantee contracts. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 are effective for any guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002 (the Companys first quarter 2003 financial statements). The Company is in the process of assessing the provisions of FIN 45 in order to determine its impact on the Companys financial position and results of operations. In January 2003, FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" (FIN 46). Pepco is in the process of assessing the provisions of FIN 46 in order to determine its impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS LACK OF COMPARABILITY OF OPERATING RESULTS WITH PRIOR YEARS As discussed in the "Overview" section herein, on August 1, 2002, in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, Pepco transferred its ownership of PCI and Pepco Energy Services to Pepco Holdings. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of shareholders equity as of December 31, 2002 include only Pepcos operations. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2001, and the consolidated statements of shareholders equity as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, as previously reported by Pepco, include the consolidated accounts of Pepco and its pre merger wholly owned subsidiaries, PCI and Pepco Energy Services. The accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2002 include Pepcos operations for the entire year consolidated with its pre merger subsidiaries operations for the seven months of January 2002 through July 2002. The accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, as previously reported by Pepco, include the consolidated operations of Pepco and its pre merger subsidiaries, for the entire year presented. Accordingly, the 2002 balances included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements referred to above are not comparable with the 2001 and 2000 balances. OPERATING REVENUE Results for 2002 Compared to 2001 Total consolidated operating revenue decreased during 2002 by $412.5 million ($1,988 million vs. $2,400.5 million). This decrease consists of a $189.6 million decrease in Utility operating revenue and a $193.6 million decrease in operating revenues for PCI and PES. The remaining decrease results from the fact that 2001 included a net gain of $29.3 million that resulted from the sale in January 2001 of the Companys interest in the Conemaugh generating station. The decrease in Pepcos operating revenue during 2002 primarily resulted from a decrease of $206.9 million in standard offer service revenue due to increased customer migration to alternate suppliers during 2002. Retail access to a competitive market for generation services was made available to all Maryland customers on July 1, 2000 and to D.C. customers on January 1, 2001. At December 31, 2002, 16% of Pepcos Maryland customers and 13% of its D.C. customers have chosen alternate suppliers. These customers accounted for 1,175 megawatts of load in Maryland (of Pepcos total load of 3,369) and 1,140 megawatts of load in D.C. (of Pepcos total load of 2,326). The decrease in standard offer service revenue was partially offset by a $26.3 million increase in delivery revenue due to higher delivered kilowatt hour sales from more favorable weather than experienced in 2001. The decrease in PCI and PES operating revenue during 2002 results from the fact that Pepcos consolidated 2002 results only include the operating results from PCI and PES for seven months (January 2002 through July 2002), compared to a full year during 2001. Results for 2001 Compared to 2000 Total consolidated operating revenue decreased during 2001 by $588.8 million ($2,400.5 million vs. $2,989.3 million). This decrease consists of a $497.1 million decrease in Utility operating revenue partially offset by a $302.8 million increase in operating revenues for PCI and PES. The remaining decrease results from the fact that 2000 included a net gain of $423.8 million related to the December 2000 divestiture of substantially all of Pepcos generating assets to Mirant versus 2001 which included a net gain of $29.3 million that resulted from the sale in January 2001 of the Companys interest in the Conemaugh generating station. The decrease in Pepcos operating revenue during 2001 resulted from decreases of $466.9 million in standard offer service revenue and $30.2 million in delivery revenue primarily due to increased customer migration to alternative suppliers during 2001. Retail access to competitive markets for generation services was made available to all Maryland customers on July 1, 2000 and to D.C. customers on January 1, 2001. At December 31, 2001, 12% of Pepcos Maryland customers and 4% of its D.C. customers had chosen alternate suppliers. These customers accounted for 800 megawatts of load in Maryland (of our total load of 3,369) and 1,026 megawatts of load in D.C. (of our total load of 2,326). Pepco Energy Services operating revenue increased during 2001 primarily resulted from increases of $283.2 million in commodity revenues and $44.3 million in services revenues due to growth in its retail commodity business. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in operating revenues by PCI primarily due to the fact that in 2000 PCI recorded a pre tax gain of approximately $19.7 million from the sale of its 50% interest in the Cove Point liquefied natural gas storage facility. OPERATING EXPENSES Results for 2002 Compared to 2001 Total consolidated operating expenses decreased during 2002 by $371 million ($1,663.1 million vs. $2,034.1 million). This decrease consists of a $128.3 million decrease in Utility operating expenses and a $242.7 million decrease in operating expenses for PCI and PES. The decrease in Utility operating expense during 2002 results from a $179.7 million decrease in fuel and purchased energy expense due to less energy purchased due to higher customer migration. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $31.2 million in O&M expenses due to an increase in severance costs recorded compared to the corresponding period last year; an increase of $8.5 million in depreciation expense; and an increase of $11.7 million in other taxes due to higher Maryland property taxes and higher delivery taxes and Pennsylvania property taxes. The decrease in PCI and PES operating expense during 2002 results from the fact that Pepcos consolidated three months ended December 31, 2002 results include only the operating results from PCI and PES for seven months (January 2002 through July 2002), compared to a full year during 2001. Results for 2001 Compared to 2000 Total consolidated operating expenses decreased during 2001 by $60.1 million ($2,034.1 million vs. $2,094.2 million). This decrease consists of a $431.1 million decrease in Utility operating expenses partially offset by a $371 million increase in operating expenses for PCI and PES. The decrease in Pepcos operating expenses during 2001 primarily resulted from a $180.6 million decrease in fuel and purchased energy expense, a $105.3 million decrease in other operation and maintenance expense, an $84 million decrease in depreciation expense, and a $20.9 million decrease in other taxes. The decreases in these expenses primarily resulted from the fact that in January 2001 Pepco completed its plan to exit the generation business by divesting of its interest in the Conemaugh generating station. Additionally, the remaining decrease in operating expenses in 2001 results from the fact that the 2000 results included an impairment loss recorded on Pepcos Benning Road and Buzzard Point generating plants of $40.3 million (pre tax). These plants were subsequently transferred to Pepco Energy Services. The increase in Pepco Energy Services operating expenses during 2001 resulted from growth in its retail commodity business. The increase in PCIs operating expenses during 2001 primarily resulted from a total of $65.5 million (pre tax) in impairment write downs recognized by PCI in 2001 related to its aircraft portfolio and other investments. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSES) Results for 2002 Compared to 2001 Total consolidated other expenses decreased during 2002 by $9 million ($96.3 million vs. $105.3 million). This decrease consists of a $28.7 million increase in Utility other (expenses) offset by a $37.7 million decrease in other (expenses) for PCI and PES. The increase in Utility other (expenses) during 2002 primarily results from a $37.1 million decrease in interest income primarily due to lower proceeds remaining to invest from the Companys generation asset divestitures, and due to a decrease of $21.8 million in interest expense as a result of lower interest expense incurred on commercial paper and other debt outstanding due to the payoff of debt. The decrease in PCI and PES other (expenses) during 2002 results from the fact that Pepcos consolidated 2002 results include only the operating results from PCI and PES for seven months (January 2002 through July 2002), compared to a full year during 2001. Results for 2001 Compared to 2000 Total consolidated other (expenses) decreased during 2001 by $87.4 million ($105.3 million vs. $192.7 million). This decrease consists of an $89.8 million decrease in Utility other (expenses) offset by a $2.4 million increase in other expenses for PCI and PES. The decrease in Pepcos other (expenses) during 2001 primarily resulted from a $40.6 million increase in interest income due to proceeds invested from Pepcos divestiture transactions and due to a decrease of $52.2 million in interest expense due to reductions in the level of Pepcos debt outstanding. A portion of the divestiture proceeds were used to pay off Pepcos outstanding debt. INCOME TAX EXPENSE Results for 2002 Compared to 2001 Total consolidated income tax expense decreased during 2002 by $3.2 million ($80.3 million vs. $83.5 million). This decrease consists of a $49.2 million decrease in Utility income tax expense and a $46 million decrease in income tax benefits for PCI and PES. The decrease in Utility income tax expense during 2002 results from lower taxes as a result of lower interest income and due to the fact that 2001 included taxes incurred on the Companys generating plant divestitures. The decrease in PCI and PES income tax benefits during 2002 results from the fact that Pepcos consolidated 2002 results include only the operating results from PCI and PES for seven months January 2002 through July 2002), compared to a full year during 2001. Results for 2001 Compared to 2000 Total consolidated income tax expense decreased during 2001 by $257.7 million ($83.5 million vs. $341.2 million). This decrease consists of a $222.0 million decrease in Utility income tax expense and a $35.7 million decrease in income tax benefits for PCI and PES. The decrease in Pepcos income tax expense during 2001 primarily resulted from the fact that the 2000 tax expense included taxes resulting from the gain on the divestiture of its generating plants in December 2000. PCIs income tax (benefit) increased during 2001 primarily due to the write down of its aircraft portfolio and other investments. This was partially offset by an increase in Pepco Energy Services income tax expense during 2001 due to improved operating results in its retail commodity and wholesale generation business along with an increase in the effective tax rate. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financing On July 15, 2002, Pepco redeemed $66.2 million 8.50% First Mortgage Bonds due May 15, 2027 at a call price of 103.21%. The redemption totaled $69.3 million. Pepco has a $300 million commercial paper program. Pepco, Pepco Holdings, DPL, and ACE established a $1.5 billion 364 day revolving credit facility with various financial institutions. Pepco is not entitled to borrow more than $300 million. On September 3, 2002, Pepco redeemed $2 million or 40,000 shares of its $3.40 Serial Preferred Stock Series of 1992, pursuant to mandatory sinking fund provisions. Pension Funding Pepcos pension assets did not achieve the level of returns assumed in the determination of their pension expense accruals during 2002. As a result, Pepco contributed $35 million to its pension plan in December 2002 to exceed a funding level of 100% with respect to its accrued benefit obligation. Effective December 31, 2002, as a result of the August 1, 2002 Pepco and Conectiv merger, the Pepco General Retirement Plan and the Conectiv Retirement Plan were merged into the Pepco Holdings Retirement Plan. Pepco Holdings adopted the Pepco and Conectiv benefit plans. The provisions and benefits of the merged plan are identical to those of the original Pepco and Conectiv Plans. Construction Expenditures Pepcos construction expenditures totaled $194.7 million in 2002. For the five year period 2003 through 2007, construction expenditures are projected to total approximately $900 million. Disclosures About Contractual Obligations And Commercial Commitments Summary information about Pepcos consolidated contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2002 is as follows: Contractual Maturity Obligation Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years (Dollars in Millions) Short term debt $ 40.0 $ 40.0 $ $ $ Long term debt 1,133.5 50.0 100.0 338.0 645.5 Preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption 47.5 2.5 5.0 40.0 Preferred trust securities 125.0 125.0 Capital and operating leases 134.7 18.0 33.8 33.3 49.6 Total $1,480.7 $110.5 $138.8 $411.3 $820.1 REGULATORY AND OTHER MATTERS Regulatory Contingencies Final briefs on Pepcos District of Columbia divestiture proceeds sharing application were filed on July 31, 2002 following an evidentiary hearing in June 2002. That application was filed to implement a provision of Pepcos D.C. Commission approved divestiture settlement that provided for a sharing of any net proceeds from the sale of its generation related assets. A principal issue in the case is whether a sharing between customers and shareholders of the excess deferred income taxes and accumulated deferred investment tax credits associated with the sold assets would violate the normalization provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and implementing regulations. On March 4, 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) that could be relevant to that principal issue. Comments on the NOPR must be filed by June 2, 2003, and the IRS will hold a public hearing on June 2, 2003. Pepco cannot predict wheth er the IRS will adopt the regulations as proposed, make changes before issuing final regulations or decide not to adopt regulations. Other issues deal with the inclusion of internal costs and cost allocations. Pepco believes that its calculation of the customers share of divestiture proceeds is correct. However, the potential exists that Pepco could be required to make additional gain sharing payments to D.C. customers. Such additional payments, which cannot be estimated, would be charged to expense and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the quarter and year in which a decision is rendered; however, Pepco does not believe that additional payments, if any, will have a material adverse impact on its financial position. It is impossible to predict when the D.C. Commission will issue a decision. Pepco filed its divestiture proceeds plan application in Maryland in April 2001. Reply briefs were filed in May 2002 and Pepco is awaiting a Proposed Order from the Hearing Examiner. It is a certainty that some party or parties will appeal the Hearing Examiners Proposed Order to the Maryland Commission. The principal issue in the case is the same normalization issue that was raised in the D.C. case. On March 4, 2003, the IRS issued a NOPR that could be relevant to that principal issue. Comments on the NOPR must be filed by June 2, 2003, and the IRS will hold a public hearing on June 2, 2003. Pepco cannot predict whether the IRS will adopt the regulations as proposed, make changes before issuing final regulations or decide not to adopt regulations. Other issues deal with the inclusion of internal costs and cost allocations. Pepco believes that its calculation of the customers share of divestiture proceeds is correct. However, the potential als o exists that Pepco would be required to make additional gain sharing payments to Maryland customers. Such additional payments, which cannot be estimated, would be charged to expense and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the quarter and year in which a decision is rendered; however, Pepco does not believe that additional payments, if any, will have a material adverse impact on its financial position. It is impossible to predict when the Hearing Examiner or the Maryland Commission will issue their decisions. In Maryland, in accordance with the terms of an agreement approved by the Maryland Commission, customers who are unable to receive generation services from another supplier, or who do not select another supplier, are entitled to receive services from Pepco until July 1, 2004 (Standard Offer Service or SOS). Pepco has entered into a settlement in Phase I of Maryland Case No. 8908 to extend its provision of SOS services in Maryland. The Settlement is awaiting approval from the Maryland Commission. The Settlement provides for an extension of SOS for four years for residential and small commercial customers, an extension of two years for medium sized commercial customers, and an extension of one year for large commercial customers. The settlement provides for a policy review by the Commission to consider how SOS will be provided after the current extension expires. The Settlement provides for SOS to be procured from the wholesale marketplace and th at Pepco will be able to recover its costs of procurement and a return. Environmental Matters Pepco is subject to regulation with respect to the environmental effects of their operations, including air and water quality control, solid and hazardous waste disposal, and limitations on land use by various federal, regional, state, and local authorities. Federal and state statutes authorize governmental agencies to compel responsible parties to clean up certain abandoned or uncontrolled hazardous waste sites. The Companys subsidiaries may incur costs to clean up facilities found to be contaminated due to current and past disposal practices. The Companys subsidiaries liability for clean up costs is affected by the activities of these governmental agencies and private land owners, the nature of past disposal practices, the activities of others. In October 1995, Pepco received notice from the EPA that it, along with several hundred other companies, may be a potentially responsible party (PRP) in connection with the Spectron Superfund Site located in Elkton, Maryland. The site was operated as a hazardous waste disposal, recycling, and processing facility from 1961 to 1988. In August 2001, Pepco entered into a Consent Decree for de minimis parties with EPA to resolve its liability at this site. Pursuant to the consent decree, in return for a de minimis payment by Pepco to the United States and a group of PRPs, those parties covenant not to sue Pepco for past and future costs of remediation at the site and the United States will also provide contribution protection against third party claims related to response actions at the site. Natural resource damages, if any, are not covered by the Consent Decree. Court approval of the Consent Decree is pending. Pepco believes that its liability at this site, pursuant to the terms of the Consent Decree, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. In December 1987, Pepco was notified by the EPA that it, along with several other utilities and nonutilities, is a PRP in connection with the polychlorinated biphenyl compounds (PCBs) contamination of a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, site owned by a nonaffiliated company. In the early 1970s, Pepco sold scrap transformers, some of which may have contained some level of PCBs, to a metal reclaimer operating at the site. In October 1994, a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) including a number of possible remedies was submitted to the EPA. In December 1997, the EPA signed a ROD that set forth a selected remedial action plan with estimated implementation costs of approximately $17 million. In June 1998, the EPA issued a unilateral Administrative Order to Pepco and 12 other PRPs to conduct the design and actions called for in the ROD. At December 31, 2002, Pepco has accrued $1.7 million for its share of these costs. The Company be lieves that its liability at this site will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. Pepcos Benning Service Center facility operates under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. The EPA issued an NPDES permit for this facility in November 2000. Pepco has filed a petition with the EPA Environmental Appeals Board seeking review and reconsideration of certain provisions of the EPAs permit determination. In May 2001, Pepco and the EPA reached a settlement on Pepcos petition, pursuant to which the EPA withdrew certain contested provisions of the permit and agreed to issue a revised draft permit for public comment. As of December 31, 2002, the EPA has not issued a revised permit and Pepco is operating pursuant to the November 2000 permit absent the withdrawn conditions in accordance with the settlement agreement. Litigation During 1993, Pepco was served with Amended Complaints filed in three jurisdictions (Prince Georges County, Baltimore City and Baltimore County), in separate ongoing, consolidated proceedings each denominated, "In re: Personal Injury Asbestos Case." Pepco (and other defendants) were brought into these cases on a theory of premises liability under which plaintiffs argue that Pepco was negligent in not providing a safe work environment for employees or its contractors who allegedly were exposed to asbestos while working on Pepcos property. Initially, a total of approximately 448 individual plaintiffs added Pepco to their Complaints. While the pleadings are not entirely clear, it appears that each plaintiff seeks $2 million in compensatory damages and $4 million in punitive damages from each defendant. In a related proceeding in the Baltimore City case, Pepco was served, in September 1993, with a third party complaint by Owens Corning Fibergl ass, Inc. (Owens Corning) alleging that Owens Corning was in the process of settling approximately 700 individual asbestos related cases and seeking a judgment for contribution against Pepco on the same theory of alleged negligence set forth above in the plaintiffs case. Subsequently, Pittsburgh Corning Corp. (Pittsburgh Corning) filed a third party complaint against Pepco, seeking contribution for the same plaintiffs involved in the Owens Corning third party complaint. Since the initial filings in 1993, approximately 90 additional individual suits have been filed against Pepco. The third party complaints involving Pittsburgh Corning and Owens Corning were dismissed by the Baltimore City Court during 1994 without any payment by Pepco. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 200 cases were pending against Pepco. Of the 200 remaining asbestos cases pending against Pepco, approximately 35 of those cases have been tendered to Mirant for defense and indemnification pursuant to the Asset Purchase and Sale Agr eement which was executed in December 2000. While the aggregate amount specified in the remaining suits would exceed $400 million, Pepco believes the amounts are greatly exaggerated, as were the claims already disposed of. The amount of total liability, if any, and any related insurance recovery cannot be precisely determined at this time; however, based on information and relevant circumstances known at this time, Pepco does not believe these suits will have a material adverse effect on its financial position. However, an unfavorable decision rendered against Pepco could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the year in which a decision is rendered. On April 7, 2000, approximately 139,000 gallons of oil leaked from a pipeline at a generation station that was owned by Pepco at Chalk Point in Aquasco, Maryland. The pipeline was operated by Support Terminals Services Operating Partnership LP, an unaffiliated pipeline management company. The oil spread from Swanson Creek to the Patuxent River and several of its tributaries. The area affected covers portions of 17 miles of shoreline along the Patuxent River and approximately 45 acres of marshland adjacent to the Chalk Point property. As a result of the oil spill, eleven class action lawsuits and two additional lawsuits on behalf of a number of Southern Maryland residents, businesses and watermen were filed against Pepco. On November 27, 2001, Pepco and ST Services entered into a Settlement Agreement with the various plaintiffs to settle all pending class action litigation stemming from the oil spill. Under the Settlement Agreement, a total of $ 2.25 million was placed in an escrow account to be distributed to watermen and property owner class members pursuant to a Plan of Distribution filed with the Court. On December 27, 2001, the Court entered an "Order Certifying Settlement Classes and Preliminarily Approving Proposed Settlement," which was approved in April 2002. In April 2002, the Claims Administrator provided the Court with a list of those members of the Settlement Classes which had timely excluded themselves from the Settlement Agreement. Approximately 80 class members elected to exclude themselves from the terms of the November 7, 2001 Settlement Agreement. The Company is involved in other legal and administrative (including environmental) proceedings before various courts and agencies with respect to matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Management is of the opinion that the final disposition of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONECTIV OVERVIEW Conectiv was formed on March 1, 1998 (the 1998 Merger), through a series of merger transactions and an exchange of common stock with Delmarva Power & Light Company (DPL) and Atlantic Energy, Inc., which owned Atlantic City Electric Company (ACE) prior to the 1998 Merger. Conectiv owns other subsidiaries in addition to ACE and DPL, including Conectiv Energy Holding Company (CEH). Conectiv, along with CEH and ACE REIT, Inc., is a registered holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). References herein to Conectiv may mean the activities of one or more subsidiary companies. On August 1, 2002, Conectiv was acquired by Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI) in a transaction pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Conectiv/Pepco Merger Agreement), dated as of February 9, 2001, among PHI (formerly New RC, Inc.), Conectiv and Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco), in which Pepco and Conectiv merged with subsidiaries of PHI (the Conectiv/Pepco Merger). As a result of the Conectiv/Pepco Merger, Conectiv and Pepco each became subsidiaries of PHI. See Note 2 to the Conectiv Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. ACE and DPL are public utilities that supply and deliver electricity through their transmission and distribution systems to approximately 999,400 customers under the trade name Conectiv Power Delivery. DPL also supplies and delivers natural gas to approximately 115,400 customers in a 275 square mile area in northern Delaware. ACEs regulated service area is located in the southern one third of New Jersey and DPLs regulated electric service area is located on the Delmarva Peninsula (Delaware and portions of Maryland and Virginia). On a combined basis, ACEs and DPLs regulated electric service areas encompass about 8,700 square miles and have a population of approximately 2.2 million. CEH and its subsidiaries are engaged in non regulated electricity production and sales, energy trading and marketing. CEHs operations began on July 1, 2000, coincident with the transfer of certain electric generating plants from ACE and DPL to CEH subsidiaries. Prior to July 1, 2000, non regulated electricity production and sales, energy trading and marketing were conducted primarily by DPL. See "Energy Hedging and Trading Activities" in Notes 3 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about energy hedging and trading activities. Conectiv has altered the focus of its electric generation operations by building new "mid merit" electric generating plants and selling electric generating plants designed to serve base load demand. Mid merit electric generating plants are combined cycle units, which are constructed with combustion turbines, waste heat recovery boilers and a steam turbine. Mid merit electric generating plants can quickly change their kWh output level on an economic basis and generally are operated during times when demand for electricity rises and prices are higher. During 2001 and 2002, Conectiv developed sites and purchased equipment for future mid merit electric generating plants and began operating six newly installed combustion turbines (654 MW). During 2000 and 2001, DPL, ACE, and another Conectiv subsidiary sold ownership interests in non strategic electric generating plants which included nuclear electric generating plants (714 MW) and fossil fuel f ired electric generating plants (1,081 MW). See Note 14 to the Conectiv Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the sales of electric generating plants during 2000 2001 and the termination of agreements for the sale of ACEs fossil fuel fired electric generating plants. For information about other businesses conducted by Conectiv subsidiaries, see the discussion of "Other services" revenues under "Revenue Recognition" in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Results of Operations discussion for Conectiv is presented only for the year ended December 31, 2002 in accordance with General Instruction I(2)(a). Electric Revenues 2002 2001 Change (Dollars in Millions) Regulated electric revenues $2,115.3 $2,080.0 $ 35.3 Non regulated electric revenues 901.2 672.1 229.1 Total electric revenues $3,016.5 $2,752.1 $264.4 The table above shows the amounts of electric revenues earned that are subject to price regulation (regulated) and that are not subject to price regulation (non regulated). "Regulated electric revenues" include revenues for delivery (transmission and distribution) service and electricity supply service within the service areas of ACE and DPL. Regulated Electric Revenues The increase in "Regulated electric revenues" resulted from an increase of $69.3 million due to higher delivered kilowatt hour sales primarily due to hotter summer weather in 2002. The increase in kilowatt hours delivered was partially offset by a $31.1 million decrease due to increased customer migration to alternate suppliers during 2002. Non regulated Electric Revenues "Non regulated electric revenues" for all periods presented reflect the effects of the netting of expenses with revenues for "energy trading book" contracts, per the provisions of EITF 02 3, as discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in "Non regulated electric revenues" resulted from an increase of $277.5 million in wholesale business related to a new contract resulting from the Basic Generation Service (BGS) auction held in February 2002; see Note 11 to the Conectiv Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the auction. The increase in wholesale business from this contract was partially offset by a $34.3 million decrease in retail revenues due to Conectivs exit from the competitive retail electricity markets by early 2001. Gas Revenues 2002 2001 Change (Dollars in Millions) Regulated gas revenues $148.3 $154.8 $ (6.5) Non regulated gas revenues 238.3 269.5 (31.2) Total gas revenues $386.6 $424.3 $(37.7) DPL has gas revenues from on system natural gas sales, which generally are subject to price regulation, and from the transportation of natural gas for customers. Conectiv subsidiaries also trade and sell natural gas in transactions that are not subject to price regulation. The table above shows the amounts of gas revenues from sources that were subject to price regulation (regulated) and that were not subject to price regulation (non regulated). The decrease in "Regulated gas revenues" primarily resulted from customer rate decreases related to recovery of lower purchased natural gas costs. "Non regulated gas revenues" for all periods presented reflect the effects of the netting of expenses with revenues for "energy trading book" contracts, per the provisions of EITF 02 3, as discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The decrease in "Non regulated gas revenues" is primarily due to Conectivs exit from the competitive retail gas business, partially offset by increases in volumes of gas trading activities. Other Services Revenues 2002 2001 Change (Dollars in Millions) Petroleum sales and trading $307.6 $324.2 $(16.6) Operation of third parties power plants 64.6 74.8 (10.2) Coal trading 1.5 13.9 (12.4) All other 65.5 74.9 (9.4) Total other services revenues $439.2 $487.8 $(48.6) The decrease in "Petroleum sales and trading" primarily resulted from lower volume and prices, which were adversely affected by the warmer winter weather in early 2002. The decrease in "Operation of third parties power plants" resulted from fewer special projects performed during 2002 at the plants in comparison to 2001. The decrease in "Coal trading" resulted from a lack of market opportunities in 2002. The decrease in "All other" primarily resulted from a lack of market opportunities in oil commodities trading in 2002. Operating Expenses Electric Fuel and Purchased Energy "Electric fuel and purchased energy" related to non regulated electric revenue activities for all periods presented reflect the effects of the netting of expenses with revenues for "energy trading book" contracts, per the provisions of EITF 02 3, as discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. "Electric fuel and purchased energy increased by $308.8 million to $2,051.9 million for 2002, from $1,743.1 million for 2001. The increase was due to a $238.7 million increase in "non regulated electric fuel and purchased energy", primarily related to procuring energy for a new contract resulting from the BGS auction held in February 2002, as noted above in the discussion of "Non regulated electric revenues." In addition, there was a $70.1 million increase in "regulated electric fuel and purchased energy" primarily related to higher volumes of kilowatt hours delivered and the higher cost of replacing the electricity produced by DPLs e lectric generating plants that were sold June 22, 2001. Gas Purchased "Gas purchased" related to non regulated gas revenue activities for all periods presented reflect the effects of the netting of expenses with revenues for "energy trading book" contracts, per the provisions of EITF 02 3, as discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. "Gas purchased" decreased by $76.5 million to $313.4 million for 2002, from $389.9 million for 2001. The decrease was mainly due to a $64.7 million decrease from lower competitive retail sales due to Conectivs exit from this business in early 2001, and reduced costs of natural gas for the regulated gas delivery business. Other Services Cost of Sales Other services cost of sales decreased by $26.6 million to $383.6 million for 2002, from $410.2 million for 2001. The primary reason for the decrease was related to lower volumes of petroleum products purchased at lower average prices. Merger related Costs Conectivs operating results for 2002 and 2001 included costs related to the Conectiv/Pepco Merger of $75.4 million ($46.0 million after income taxes) and $17.0 million ($11.0 million after income taxes), respectively. The $75.4 million of costs for 2002 included the following: (i) a $30.5 million write down of deferred electric service costs based on the terms of the Decision and Order issued by the NJBPU on July 3, 2002 that required ACE to forgo recovery of such costs effective upon the Conectiv/Pepco Merger; (ii) $18.4 million for severances and stock options settled in cash; and (iii) $26.5 million for investment banking, legal, consulting and other costs. The $17.0 million of costs for 2001 included investment banking, legal, consulting and other costs. Based on the terms of the settlement agreements and Commission orders in the States having regulatory jurisdiction over Conectiv, none of the costs related to the Conectiv/Pepco Merger are recoverable in future customer rate increases. Such costs are, and will be, excluded from studies submitted in base rate filings. Other Operation and Maintenance Other operation and maintenance expenses increased by $34.7 million to $516.9 million for 2002, from $482.2 million for 2001. The increase was mainly due to higher pension and other postretirement benefits expense, partly offset by lower operating expenses due to the sale of electric generating plants during 2001 and $16.3 million received by DPL in 2001 for termination of its membership in a nuclear mutual insurance company. Pension expense increased during 2002 mainly due to the adverse effects of stock market conditions on the fair value of trust fund assets and amortization of previous actuarial gains. Loss on Sale of Leveraged Leases On July 3, 2002, Conectiv sold its leveraged lease portfolio of three aircraft and two containerships, which had a carrying value of $44.6 million, before an impairment reserve associated with the sale. In consideration for the assets sold, Conectiv received cash of $24.4 million and a note, which had an estimated fair value of $3.0 million. As a result of the sale, operating results for 2002 include a loss of $19.7 million before taxes, or $11.2 million after taxes. Impairment Losses As a result of Conectivs decision to sell an office building during 2002, Conectiv was required to test the buildings carrying value for impairment and the test showed that Conectivs carrying value for the office building was impaired as of September 30, 2002. Accordingly, a $4.0 million before tax impairment charge ($2.4 million after tax) was recorded in the third quarter of 2002. Conectivs assessment of the carrying value of the office building was based on offers received from potential purchasers of the building. The sale of the office building was completed in December 2002. In connection with Conectivs second competitive bidding process for the sale of ACEs fossil fuel fired electric generating plants, an impairment of the carrying value of ACEs Deepwater power plant was identified. Accordingly, a $9.5 million before tax impairment charge ($5.6 million after tax) was recorded in December 2002. Conectivs assessment of the carrying value of the Deepwater power plant was based on offers from the competitive bidding process. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by $35.5 million to $193.0 million for 2002, from $228.5 million for 2001. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of electric generating plants during 2001 and no longer amortizing goodwill due to SFAS No. 142, partly offset by an increase for depreciation of new mid merit electric generating plants. Other Taxes Other taxes decreased by $10.4 million to $64.0 million for 2002, from $74.4 million for 2001. The decrease was mainly due to expiration of the amortization of a regulatory asset for New Jersey state excise taxes. Deferred Electric Service Costs Deferred electric service costs decreased by $71.9 million to $(71.3) million for 2002, from $(143.2) million for 2001. The decrease in deferred costs (causing an overall increase in total operating expenses) was mainly due to lower costs related to ACE providing Basic Generation Service, in addition to no longer including a return that had been earned on ACEs ownership interests in nuclear plants until such interests were sold in 2001. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of deferred electric service costs and basic generation service. Other Income (Expenses) Other (expenses) increased by $6.6 million to a net expense of $(120.8) million for 2002, from a net expense of $(114.2) million for 2001. Net other (expenses) for 2001 includes a pre tax gain of $73.0 million from the recognition of a previously deferred gain related to termination of a purchased power contract, as discussed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding the variance attributable to the $73.0 million gain on termination of a purchased power contract, net other (expenses) decreased $66.4 million. This decrease is primarily due to a $37.9 million decrease in interest expense, net of capitalized amounts, resulting from lower interest rates and lower amounts of outstanding short term debt, as well as an $18.9 million decrease in losses on investments. Income Taxes Income taxes decreased by $181.0 million to $70.6 million for 2002, from $251.6 million for 2001, primarily due to lower income from continuing operations before income taxes.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DELMARVA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY OVERVIEW DPL is a subsidiary of Conectiv, which is a registered holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). On March 1, 1998, Conectiv was formed (the 1998 Merger) through an exchange of common stock with DPL and Atlantic Energy, Inc. On August 1, 2002, Conectiv was acquired by Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI) in a transaction pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Conectiv/Pepco Merger Agreement), dated as of February 9, 2001, among PHI (formerly New RC, Inc.), Conectiv and Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco), in which Pepco and Conectiv merged with subsidiaries of PHI (the Conectiv/Pepco Merger). As a result of the Conectiv/Pepco Merger, Conectiv and Pepco and their respective subsidiaries (including DPL) each became subsidiaries of PHI. DPL continues as a wholly owned, direct subsidiary of Conectiv. See Note 2 to the DPL Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. DPL is a public utility which supplies and delivers electricity and natural gas to its customers under the trade name Conectiv Power Delivery. DPL delivers electricity to approximately 485,100 regulated customers through its transmission and distribution systems and also supplies electricity to most of its electricity delivery customers, who have the option of choosing an alternative supplier. DPLs regulated electric service territory is located on the Delmarva Peninsula (Delaware and portions of Maryland and Virginia). DPLs electric service area encompasses about 6,000 square miles and has a population of approximately 1.2 million. DPL provides regulated gas service (supply and or delivery) to approximately 115,400 customers located in a service territory that covers about 275 square miles with a population of approximately 500,000 in New Castle County, Delaware. DPL also sells gas off system and in markets that are not subject to price regulation. The divestiture of the electric generating plants of DPL was completed on June 22, 2001 with the sale of the ownership interests of DPL in various electric generating plants that had 954 megawatts (MW) of capacity. The divestiture of the electric generating plants of DPL started in 2000. DPL contributed electric generating plants with 1,501 MW of capacity to Conectiv on July 1, 2000, in connection with the formation of Conectiv Energy Holding Company (CEH), which has subsidiaries engaged in non regulated electricity production, energy trading and marketing. Divestiture of the electric generating plants also included the sale of DPLs ownership interests in nuclear electric generating plants (331 MW) on December 29, 2000. Prior to the formation of CEH on July 1, 2000, DPLs business activities included trading electricity and natural gas and the sale of electricity produced by non regulated electric generating units. The transition of these activities from DPL to CEH and its subsidiaries occurred during the latter half of 2000. Regulation of Utility Operations Certain aspects of DPLs utility businesses are subject to regulation by the Delaware and Maryland Public Service Commissions (DPSC and MPSC, respectively), the Virginia State Corporation Commission (VSCC), and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Excluding sales not subject to price regulation, the percentages of retail electric and gas utility operating revenues regulated by each state regulatory commission for 2002, were as follows: DPSC, 67.5%; MPSC, 29.4%; and VSCC, 3.1%. Wholesale sales and the transmission of electricity and gas are subject to FERC regulation. Retail gas sales are subject to regulation by the DPSC. As discussed in Note 7 to the DPL Consolidated Financial Statements, DPLs electricity generation business was restructured in the latter half of 1999, pursuant to enactment of Delaware and Maryland electric restructuring legislation and the issuance of restructuring orders by the DPSC and MPSC. Based on these orders, DPL determined that the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71) no longer applied to its electricity generation business and an extraordinary charge to 1999 earnings resulted. DPLs electric delivery business and retail gas business are subject to the requirements of SFAS No. 71. When utility revenues are insufficient to recover current period expenses from customers, regulatory commissions may provide for future recovery from customers of such current period expenses. When future recovery is probable for current under recoveries of utility expenses, the expenses are deferred as regulatory assets and subsequently recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income during the period the expenses are recovered from customers. Similarly, regulatory liabilities may also be created due to the economic impact of an action taken by a regulatory commission. The amount recognized in the DPL Consolidated Statements of Income for the cost of gas purchased to supply DPLs regulated gas customers is adjusted to the amount included in customer billings for such costs since customer rates are periodically adjusted to reflect amounts actually paid by DPL for purchased gas. A regulatory asset is recorded for under collections from customers and a liability is recorded for over collections from customers, which are both included in "regulatory assets, net" as "deferred energy supply costs" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about regulatory assets and liabilities arising from the financial effects of rate regulation. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Results of Operations discussion for DPL is presented only for the year ended December 31, 2002 in accordance with General Instruction I(2)(a). Electric Revenues 2002 2001 Change (Dollars in Millions) Regulated electric revenues $1,036.4 $1,053.3 $(16.9) Non regulated electric revenues 3.4 5.8 (2.4) Total electric revenues $1,039.8 $1,059.1 $(19.3) The table above shows the amounts of electric revenues earned that are subject to price regulation (regulated) and that are not subject to price regulation (non regulated). "Regulated electric revenues" include revenues for delivery (transmission and distribution) service and electricity supply service within the service areas of DPL. Regulated Electric Revenues The decrease in "Regulated electric revenues" resulted from lower interchange and resale sales due to the sale of electric generating plants in 2001 and increased customer migration to alternate suppliers during 2002, partially offset by higher delivered kilowatt hour sales primarily due to hotter summer weather in 2002. Gas Revenues 2002 2001 Change (Dollars in Millions) Regulated gas revenues $148.3 $154.8 $ (6.5) Non regulated gas revenues 29.8 75.8 (46.0) Total gas revenues $178.1 $230.6 $(52.5) DPL has gas revenues from on system natural gas sales, which generally are subject to price regulation, and from the transportation of natural gas for customers. The table above shows the amounts of gas revenues from sources that were subject to price regulation (regulated) and that were not subject to price regulation (non regulated). The decrease in "Regulated gas revenues" primarily resulted from customer rate decreases related to recovery of lower purchased natural gas costs. The decrease in "Non regulated gas revenues" is primarily due to DPLs exit from the competitive retail gas business and only selling to large industrial customers. Operating Expenses Electric Fuel and Purchased Energy "Electric fuel and purchased energy" increased by $30.1 million to $677.0 million for 2002, from $646.9 million for 2001. The increase was due to higher volumes of kilowatt hours delivered and the higher cost of replacing the electricity produced by DPLs electric generating plants that were sold June 22, 2001. Gas Purchased "Gas purchased" decreased by $53.8 million to $124.9 million for 2002, from $178.7 million for 2001. The decrease was mainly due to lower competitive retail sales due to Conectivs exit from this business in early 2001, and reduced costs of natural gas for the regulated gas delivery business. Merger related Costs DPLs operating results for 2002 included costs related to the Conectiv/Pepco Merger of $9.7 million ($5.8 million after income taxes). The $9.7 million of costs included the following: (i) $8.2 million for severances and stock options settled in cash; and (ii) $1.5 million for contributions to certain funds based on the terms of orders issued by the MPSC and DPSC. Based on the terms of the settlement agreements and Commission orders in the States having regulatory jurisdiction over DPL, none of the costs related to the Conectiv/Pepco Merger are recoverable in future customer rate increases. Such costs are, and will be, excluded from studies submitted in base rate filings. Other Operation and Maintenance Other operation and maintenance expenses increased by $16.4 million to $178.7 million for 2002, from $162.3 million for 2001. The increase was mainly due to higher pension and other postretirement benefits expense, partly offset by lower operating expenses due to the sale of electric generating plants during 2001 and $16.3 million received by DPL in 2001 for termination of its membership in a nuclear mutual insurance company. Pension expense increased during 2002 mainly due to the adverse effects of stock market conditions on the fair value of trust fund assets and amortization of previous actuarial gains. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by $13.2 million to $82.1 million for 2002, from $95.3 million for 2001, primarily due to the sale of electric generating plants during 2001. Other Income (Expenses) Other (expenses) decreased by $15.5 million to a net expense of $(33.3) million for 2002, from a net expense of $(48.8) million for 2001. This decrease is primarily due to lower interest expense, net of capitalized amounts, resulting from the repayment of long term debt, partially offset by lower interest income. Income Taxes Income taxes decreased by $106.2 million to $33.7 million for 2002, from $139.9 million for 2001, primarily due to lower income before income taxes. THIS PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ATLANTIC CITY ELECTRIC COMPANY OVERVIEW Atlantic City Electric Company (ACE) is a subsidiary of Conectiv, which is a registered holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). On March 1, 1998, Conectiv was formed (the 1998 Merger) through an exchange of common stock with Atlantic Energy, Inc. and Delmarva Power & Light Company (DPL). On August 1, 2002, Conectiv was acquired by Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI) in a transaction pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Conectiv/Pepco Merger Agreement), dated as of February 9, 2001, among PHI (formerly New RC, Inc.), Conectiv and Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco), in which Pepco and Conectiv merged with subsidiaries of PHI (the Conectiv/Pepco Merger). As a result of the Conectiv/Pepco Merger, Conectiv and Pepco and their respective subsidiaries (including ACE) each became subsidiaries of PHI. ACE continues as a wholly owned, direct subsidiary of Conectiv. See Note 2 to the ACE Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. ACE is a public utility which supplies and delivers electricity to its customers under the trade name Conectiv Power Delivery. ACE delivers electricity within its service area to approximately 514,300 customers through its transmission and distribution systems and also supplies electricity (Basic Generation Service) to most of its electricity delivery customers, who have the option of choosing an alternative supplier. ACEs regulated service area covers about 2,700 square miles within the southern one third of New Jersey and has a population of approximately 0.9 million. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Results of Operations discussion for ACE is presented only for the year ended December 31, 2002 in accordance with General Instruction I(2)(a). Electric Revenues 2002 2001 Change (Dollars in Millions) Regulated electric revenues $1,078.9 $1,026.7 $52.2 Non regulated electric revenues 5.8 14.4 (8.6) Total electric revenues $1,084.7 $1,041.1 $43.6 The table above shows the amounts of electric revenues earned that are subject to price regulation (regulated) and that are not subject to price regulation (non regulated). "Regulated electric revenues" include revenues for delivery (transmission and distribution) service and electricity supply service within the service areas of ACE. Regulated Electric Revenues The increase in "Regulated electric revenues" resulted from higher delivered kilowatt hour sales primarily due to hotter summer weather in 2002, and higher volumes of interchange and resale sales, partially offset by a decrease due to increased customer migration to alternate suppliers during 2002. Operating Expenses Electric Fuel and Purchased Energy "Electric fuel and purchased energy" increased by $45.9 million to $682.5 million for 2002, from $636.6 million for 2001. The increase was due to higher volumes of kilowatt hours delivered and the higher average cost per kWh of electricity supplied to customers. Merger related Costs ACEs operating results for 2002 include costs related to the Conectiv/Pepco Merger of $38.1 million ($22.6 million after income taxes). The $38.1 million of costs included the following: (i) a $30.5 million write down of deferred electric service costs based on the terms of the Decision and Order issued by the NJBPU on July 3, 2002 that required ACE to forgo recovery of such costs effective upon the Conectiv/Pepco Merger; (ii) $6.6 million for severances and stock options settled in cash; and (iii) $1.0 million for a contribution to a certain fund based on the terms of an order issued by the NJBPU. Based on the terms of the settlement agreements and Commission orders in the States having regulatory jurisdiction over ACE, none of the costs related to the Conectiv/Pepco Merger are recoverable in future customer rate increases. Such costs are, and will be, excluded from studies submitted in base rate filings. Other Operation and Maintenance Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased by $5.6 million to $243.6 million for 2002, from $249.2 million for 2001. The decrease was mainly due to the effect of the sale of ACEs interests in nuclear electric generating plants in October 2001, partly offset by higher pension and other postretirement benefits expense and severance and environmental costs for the Deepwater power plant. Pension expense increased during 2002 mainly due to the adverse effects of stock market conditions on the fair value of trust fund assets and amortization of previous actuarial gains. Impairment Losses The impairment loss of $9.5 million in 2002 represents the write down of the Deepwater power plant due to impairment of value based on the results of a competitive bidding process. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by $15.5 million to $69.2 million for 2002, from $84.7 million for 2001 primarily due to the sale of ACEs interests in nuclear electric generating plants during 2001. Other Taxes Other taxes decreased by $9.3 million to $24.8 million for 2002, from $34.1 million for 2001. The decrease was mainly due to expiration of the amortization of a regulatory asset for New Jersey state excise taxes. Deferred Electric Service Costs Deferred electric service costs decreased by $71.9 million to $(71.3) million for 2002, from $(143.2) million for 2001. The decrease in deferred costs (causing an overall increase in total operating expenses) was mainly due to lower costs related to ACE providing Basic Generation Service, in addition to no longer including a return that had been earned on ACEs ownership interests in nuclear plants until such interests were sold in 2001. Other Income (Expenses) Other (expenses) decreased by $13.7 million to a net expense of $(36.2) million for 2002, from a net expense of $(49.9) million for 2001. This decrease is primarily due to lower interest expense, net of capitalized amounts, resulting from repayment of long term debt partly offset by an increase in income from billings to customers to recover ACEs income tax expense on contributions in aid of construction. Income Taxes Income taxes decreased by $30.4 million to $16.3 million for 2002, from $46.7 million for 2001, primarily due to lower income before income taxes. THIS PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ATLANTIC CITY ELECTRIC TRANSITION FUNDING LLC OVERVIEW Atlantic City Electric Transition Funding LLC (ACE Funding), a limited liability company established by Atlantic City Electric (ACE) under the laws of the State of Delaware, was formed on March 28, 2001 pursuant to a limited liability company agreement with ACE dated April 11, 2001 as amended, as sole member of ACE Funding. ACE is a wholly owned subsidiary of Conectiv, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pepco Holdings, Inc., a registered holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. ACE is a public utility, which supplies and delivers electricity to its customers under the trade name Conectiv Power Delivery. ACE Funding was organized for the sole purpose of purchasing and owning Bondable Transition Property (BTP), issuing transition bonds (Bonds) to fund purchasing BTP, pledging its interest in BTP and other collateral to the Trustee to collateralize the Bonds, and performing activities that are necessary, suitable or convenient to accomplish these purposes. BTP represents the irrevocable right of ACE or its successor or assignee, to collect a non bypassable transition bond charge (TBC) from customers pursuant to the bondable stranded costs rate order (BPU Financing Order), issued on September 20, 2002 by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) in accordance with the Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act enacted by the state of New Jersey in February 1999. The BPU Financing Order authorizes the TBC to be sufficient to recover $440 million aggregate principal amount of transition bonds, plus an amount sufficient to provide for any credit enhancement, to fund any reserves and to pay interest, redemption premiums, if any, servicing fees and other expenses relating to the Bonds. ACE Fundings organizational documents require it to operate in a manner so that it should not be consolidated in the bankruptcy estate of ACE in the event ACE becomes subject to bankruptcy proceeding. Both ACE and ACE Funding will treat the transfer of the BTP to ACE Funding as a sale under the applicable law. The Bonds will be treated as debt of ACE Funding. For financial reporting, federal income tax and State of New Jersey income and corporation business tax purposes, the transfer of BTP to ACE Funding is being treated as a financing arrangement and not as a sale. Furthermore, the results of operations of ACE Funding will be consolidated with ACE for financial and income tax reporting purposes. ACE Funding did not have results of operations or members equity in the period from its formation to December 31, 2001, as ACE Funding had not issued Bonds and purchased BTP. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Pepco Holdings Market Risk Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. Certain of Pepco Holdings financial instruments are exposed to market risk in the form of interest rate risk, equity price risk, commodity risk, and credit and nonperformance risk. Pepco Holdings management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. Management reviews any open positions in accordance with strict policies in order to limit exposure to market risk. Interest Rate Risk Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries debt is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. Pepco Holdings manages interest rates through the use of fixed and, to a lesser extent, variable rate debt. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates on the annual interest costs for short term and variable rate debt was approximately $2.6 million as of December 31, 2002. PCI uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its overall borrowing rate and limit its interest rate risk. The potential loss in fair value from these agreements resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in base interest rates was estimated at $3.4 million at December 31, 2002. Equity Price Risk The Company through its subsidiaries holds investments in marketable equity securities and venture capital funds, which invest in securities of technology and service companies related to energy, utility, and communication industries and invests in marketable securities, which consist primarily of preferred stocks with mandatory redemption features and investment grade commercial paper. Pepco Holdings is exposed to equity price risk through the investments in the marketable equity securities and the venture capital funds. The potential change in the fair value of these investments resulting from a hypothetical 10% decrease in quoted securities prices was approximately $11.3 million as of December 31, 2002. Due to the nature of these investments and market conditions, the fair value of these investments may change by substantially more than 10%. Commodity Price Risk Pepco Holdings is at risk for a decrease in market liquidity to levels that affect its capability to execute its commodity participation strategies. The Company believes the commodity markets to be sufficiently liquid to support its market participation. Conectivs participation in wholesale energy markets includes trading and arbitrage activities, which expose Conectiv to commodity market risk. To the extent Conectiv has net open positions, controls are in place that are intended to keep risk exposures within management approved risk tolerance levels. Conectiv engages in commodity hedging activities to minimize the risk of market fluctuations associated with the purchase and sale of energy commodities (natural gas, petroleum, coal and electricity). The majority of these hedges relate to the procurement of fuel for its power plants, fixing the cash flows from the plant output, and securing power for electric load service. Conectivs hedging activities are conducted using derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, which are designed to reduce the volatility on future cash flows. Conectivs energy commodity hedging objectives, in accordance with its risk management policy, are pri marily the assurance of stable and known cash flows and the fixing of favorable prices and margins when they become available. Conectiv manages to the objective of hedging the variability in future cash flows for forecasted energy output from its generation assets at 75% or greater of such forecasted output over a period of 36 months. As of December 2002, Conectivs average forecasted hedge position for the forward 36 months was projected to meet that objective. Pepco Energy Services uses forward, futures, options and swap contracts to hedge firm commitments or anticipated commodity transactions, and also, from time to time, creates trading positions. Credit and Nonperformance Risk Certain of the Companys subsidiaries agreements may be subject to credit losses and nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company anticipates that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the agreements. The Company attempts to minimize credit risk exposure to its wholesale energy counterparties through, among other things, formal credit policies, regular assessment of counterparty creditworthiness that results in the establishment of a credit limit for each counterparty, monitoring procedures that include stress testing, the use of standard agreements which allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty and collateral requirements under certain circumstances, and has established reserves for credit losses. As of December 31, 2002, the Companys credit exposure to wholesale energy counterparties was weighted 86% with investment gr ade counterparties, 13% with counterparties without external credit quality ratings, and 1% with non investment grade counterparties. Pepco Market Risk Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. Certain of Pepcos financial instruments are exposed to market risk in the form of interest rate risk, equity price risk, commodity risk, and credit and nonperformance risk. Pepcos management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. Management reviews any open positions in accordance with strict policies in order to limit exposure to market risk. Interest Rate Risk Pepcos debt is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. Pepco manages interest rates through the use of fixed and, to a lesser extent, variable rate debt. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates on the annual interest costs for short term debt was approximately $.2 million as of December 31, 2002. INFORMATION FOR THIS ITEM IS NOT REQUIRED FOR CONECTIV, DPL, ACE AND ACE FUNDING AS THEY MEET THE CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS I(1)(a) AND (b) OF FORM 10 K AND THEREFORE ARE FILING THIS FORM WITH A REDUCED FILING FORMAT.
