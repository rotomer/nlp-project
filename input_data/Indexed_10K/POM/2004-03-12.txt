Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The information required by this item is contained herein, as follows: Registrants Page No. Pepco Holdings 28 Pepco 72 DPL 98 ACE 106 26 THIS PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK. 27 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PEPCO HOLDINGS, INC. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Lack Of Comparability Of Operating Results With Prior Years The accompanying results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 include Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries results for the full year. The results of operations for 2002 include the results of Pepco and its pre merger subsidiaries for the entire period consolidated with the results of Conectiv and its subsidiaries starting on August 1, 2002, the date the merger was completed. Accordingly, the results of operations for 2003 and 2002, are not comparable. All amounts in the tables below are in millions. Operating Revenue Results for 2003 Compared to 2002 Total consolidated operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003, was $7,271.3 million compared to $4,324.5 million for 2002. Intercompany revenue has been eliminated for purposes of this analysis. A detail of these amounts is as follows: 2003 2002 Change Pepco $1,548.0 $1,533.5 $ 14.5 Conectiv Power Delivery 2,471.1 996.2 1,474.9 Conectiv Energy 2,070.6 850.2 1,220.4 Pepco Energy Services 1,066.7 826.7 240.0 Other Non Regulated 114.9 117.9 (3.0) Total $7,271.3 $4,324.5 The increase in Pepcos operating revenue for 2003 primarily resulted from the following: Delivery revenue increased by $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase results from a $19.2 million increase from a fuel tax pass through, partially offset by $.7 million decrease in Delivery revenue (revenue Pepco receives for delivering energy to its customers). The $.7 million decrease results from a .6% decrease in delivered kilowatt hour sales. SOS revenue (revenue Pepco receives for the procurement of energy by Pepco for its SOS customers) increased by $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 due to colder winter weather as heating degree days increased by 12.2%, offset by milder summer weather as cooling degree days decreased by 30.2%. Pepcos retail access to a competitive market for generation services was made available to all Maryland customers on July 1, 2000 and to D.C. customers on January 1, 2001. As of December 31, 2003, 14% of Pepcos Maryland customers and 11% of its D.C. customers have chosen alternate suppliers. These customers accounted for 912 megawatts of load in Maryland (of Pepcos total load of 3,439) and 970 megawatts of load in D.C. (of Pepcos total load of 2,269). As of December 31, 2002, 16% of Pepcos 28 Maryland customers and 13% of its D.C. customers have chosen alternate suppliers. These customers accounted for 1,175 megawatts of load in Maryland (of Pepcos total load of 3,369) and 1,140 megawatts of load in D.C. (of Pepcos total load of 2,326). Other revenue decreased $8.6 million primarily due to lower capacity (megawatts) available to sell, lower capacity market rates and restructuring in the PJM market. The 2003 amounts for Conectiv Power Delivery and Conectiv Energy represent their operations for the entire period. The increase in Pepco Energy Services operating revenue during 2003 was primarily due to growth in its commodity business from sales of electricity and natural gas due to higher volumes which resulted from more commercial and industrial customers being served and higher prices due to wholesale commodity market conditions. In 2003, wholesale and retail megawatt hour sales increased by approximately 16% and wholesale and retail dekatherm sales increased by approximately 19%. The decrease in Other Non Regulated operating revenue during 2003 was primarily due to a decrease of approximately $11.5 million related to revenue generated from Pepco Enterprises, Inc.s (PEI) operations (which includes the principal operating business of two entities that provide high voltage construction and maintenance services to utilities and to other customers throughout the United States), which were transferred from PCI to Pepco Energy Services during the third quarter of 2003, as well as due to a decrease of approximately $6.0 million in revenue from various financial investments. These decreases were partially offset by higher lease portfolio revenue of approximately $14.5 million derived from new energy leveraged leases entered into during 2002. Results for 2002 Compared to 2001 Total consolidated operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002, was $4,324.5 million compared to $2,371.2 million for 2001. Intercompany revenue has been eliminated for purposes of this analysis. A detail of these amounts is as follows: 2002 2001 Change Pepco $1,533.5 $1,723.5 $(190.0) Conectiv Power Delivery 996.2 996.2 Conectiv Energy 850.2 850.2 Pepco Energy Services 826.7 541.5 285.2 Other Non Regulated 117.9 106.2 11.7 Total $4,324.5 $2,371.2 The decrease in Pepcos operating revenue during 2002 primarily resulted from a decrease of $206.9 million in standard offer service revenue due to increased customer migration to alternate suppliers during 2002. Retail access to a competitive market for generation services was made available to all Maryland customers on July 1, 2000 and to D.C. customers on January 1, 2001. At December 31, 2002, 16% of Pepcos Maryland customers and 13% of its D.C. customers have chosen alternate suppliers. These customers accounted for 1,175 megawatts of load in Maryland (of Pepcos total load of 3,369) and 1,140 megawatts of load in D.C. (of Pepcos total load of 2,326). The decrease in standard offer service revenue was partially offset by a $26.3 29 million increase in delivery revenue due to higher delivered kilowatt hour sales from more favorable weather than experienced in 2001. The 2002 amounts for Conectiv Power Delivery and Conectiv Energy represent their post merger operations for the five months of August 2002 through December 2002. The 2001 year was pre merger and therefore no Conectiv Power Delivery or Conectiv Energy operations are included. Accordingly, the years are not comparable. The increase in Pepco Energy Services operating revenue during 2002 primarily resulted from growth in its retail commodity business for sales of electricity and natural gas to new customers. The increase in Other Non Regulated operating revenue during 2002 was mainly due to higher lease portfolio revenue of $10.6 million derived from new energy leveraged leases entered into in late 2001 and throughout 2002. Operating Expenses Results for 2003 Compared to 2002 Total consolidated operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003, were $6,654.9 million compared to $3,778.9 million for 2002. Intercompany expenses have been eliminated for purposes of this analysis. A detail of these amounts is as follows: 2003 2002 Change Pepco $1,300.1 $1,219.7 $ 80.4 Conectiv Power Delivery 1,590.9 649.2 941.7 Conectiv Energy 2,830.6 1,071.8 1,758.8 Pepco Energy Services 1,068.2 809.6 258.6 Other Non Regulated (29.9) 53.7 (83.6) Corporate and Other (105.0) (25.1) (79.9) Total $6,654.9 $3,778.9 The increase in Pepcos operating expense during 2003 primarily results from the recording of a $14.5 million reserve to reflect a potential exposure related to a pre petition receivable from Mirant, for which Pepco filed a creditors claim in the bankruptcy proceedings, plus $15.3 million higher SOS costs. The increase also reflects $11.6 million increase for software amortization, $8.3 million increase in other taxes primarily due to higher fuel taxes. Also, there were $8.4 million of higher storm restoration expenses and $9.2 million higher pension and other post retirement benefits. The 2003 amounts for Conectiv Power Delivery and Conectiv Energy represent their operations for the entire period. The 2002 amounts represent only post merger results and therefore the periods are not comparable. Due to uncertainty in the energy markets, and current levels of capacity reserves within PJM, Conectiv Energy cancelled an order for four GE combustion turbines (CTs) in the first quarter of 2003. As a result, during the first quarter of 2003, Pepco Holdings recognized a net pre tax write off of $50.1 million ($29.5 million after tax). Additionally, Conectiv Energy lost $44 million ($27 million after tax) resulting from net trading losses prior to the cessation of proprietary trading. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2003 a net pre tax CT impairment charge of $3.2 million ($1.7 million after tax) was recorded. 30 The increase in Pepco Energy Services operating expenses during 2003 primarily resulted from growth in its retail commodity business for sales of electricity and natural gas due to higher volumes which resulted from more commercial and industrial customers being served and higher prices due to wholesale commodity market conditions. The decrease in Other Non Regulated operating expenses during 2003 primarily results from the $68.8 million pretax gain from the sale of Edison Place, which was treated as an offset against operating expenses. Additionally, operating expenses during 2003 decreased by approximately $8.4 million due to the transfer of PEI to Pepco Energy Services in the third quarter of 2003. The decreases were partially offset by an $8.1 million ($5.2 million after tax) net impairment charge recorded during the fourth quarter of 2003 related to PCIs aircraft portfolio. "Corporate and Other" primarily includes two purchase accounting adjustments made in 2003. During the first quarter of 2003, a loss was recognized on the CT contract cancellation of $57.9 million before tax ($34.6 million after tax). Then in the fourth quarter of 2003, a pretax CT impairment charge of $29.6 million ($19.2 million after tax) was recorded on additional assets. Results for 2002 Compared to 2001 Total consolidated operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002, were $3,778.9 million compared to $2,004.8 million for 2001. Intercompany expenses have been eliminated for purposes of this analysis. A detail of these amounts is as follows: 2002 2001 Change Pepco $1,219.7 $1,334.4 $ (114.7) Conectiv Power Delivery 649.2 649.2 Conectiv Energy 1,071.8 1,071.8 Pepco Energy Services 809.6 524.1 285.5 Other Non Regulated 53.7 146.3 (92.6) Corporate and Other (25.1) (25.1) Total $3,778.9 $2,004.8 The decrease in Pepcos operating expenses during 2002 resulted primarily from a $179.7 million decrease in fuel and purchased energy expense due to less energy purchased because of increased customer migration. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in other operation and maintenance expense of $13.8 million due mainly to an increase in employee benefits and vacation liability accrual as well as from a general increase in power delivery expenses, an increase in other taxes of $11.7 million due to higher Maryland property and delivery taxes, and an increase of $8.5 million in depreciation expense. Additionally, Pepcos 2001 operating expenses included a $29.3 million gain that resulted from the sale of Pepcos interest in the Conemaugh generating station in 2001. The 2002 amounts for Conectiv Power Delivery and Conectiv Energy represent their post merger operations for the five months of August 2002 through December 2002. The 2001 year was pre merger and therefore no Conectiv Power Delivery or Conectiv Energy operations are included. Accordingly, the years are not comparable. 31 The increase in Pepco Energy Services operating expenses during 2002 primarily resulted from growth in its retail commodity business and due to the fact that 2002 reflected a full year of operations from businesses acquired in 2001. The decrease in Other Non Regulated operating expenses during 2002 primarily resulted from a $20.5 million decrease in depreciation expense incurred as a result of fewer aircraft on operating leases in 2002 and due to the fact that in 2001 PCI recognized a total of $65.5 million (pre tax) in impairment write downs related to its aircraft portfolio and other investments. "Corporate and Other" primarily includes severance costs of $25.4 million (pre tax) recorded during 2002 related to Pepco and Conectiv. Additionally, this line item includes unallocated Pepco Holdings operating expenses, such as the acquisition financing and the amortization of "purchase accounting" related adjustments to the fair value of non regulated Conectiv assets and liabilities as of August 1, 2002. Other Income (Expenses) Results for 2003 Compared to 2002 Total consolidated other (expenses) for the year ended December 31, 2003, were $(429.0) million compared to $(190.4) million for 2002. A detail of these amounts is as follows: 2003 2002 Change Pepco $ (69.2) $ (71.6) $(2.4) Conectiv Power Delivery (82.4) (25.9) 56.5 Conectiv Energy (10.8) (5.0) 5.8 Pepco Energy Services 4.1 (1.0) (5.1) Other Non Regulated (146.8) (52.0) 94.8 Corporate and Other (123.9) (34.9) 89.0 Total $(429.0) $(190.4) The decrease in Pepcos other expenses during 2003 primarily resulted from a $8.1 million decrease in interest expense due to lower debt outstanding, partially offset by a $6.2 million increase in interest expense due to distributions on mandatorily redeemable serial preferred securities that in accordance with SFAS No. 150 were reclassified to interest expense commencing in the third quarter of 2003. The 2003 amounts for Conectiv Power Delivery and Conectiv Energy represent their operations for the entire period. The 2002 amounts represent only post merger results and therefore the periods are not comparable. The increase in Other Non Regulated operating expense for the year ended 2003 primarily includes an impairment charge of $102.6 million ($66.7 million after tax) related to Pepco Holdings investment in Starpower. Because of the distressed telecommunications market and the changed expectations of Starpowers future performance, Pepco Holdings determined that its investment in Starpower was impaired at December 31, 2003. "Corporate and other" in 2003 primarily represents unallocated Pepco Holdings capital costs, incurred as a result of long term acquisition financing entered into in late 2002. 32 Results for 2002 Compared to 2001 Total consolidated other (expenses) for the year ended December 31, 2002, were ($190.4) million compared to ($105.3) million for 2001. A detail of these amounts is as follows: 2002 2001 Change Pepco $ (71.6) $ (48.8) $22.8 Conectiv Power Delivery (25.9) 25.9 Conectiv Energy (5.0) 5.0 Pepco Energy Services (1.0) 1.4 2.4 Other Non Regulated (52.0) (57.9) (5.9) Corporate and Other (34.9) 34.9 Total $(190.4) $(105.3) The increase in Pepcos other (expenses) during 2002 primarily resulted from a $37.1 million decrease in interest income earned due to lower proceeds remaining to invest from Pepcos generating asset divestitures. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $21.8 million in interest expense due to lower debt balances outstanding during 2002. The 2002 amounts for Conectiv Power Delivery and Conectiv Energy represent their post merger operations for the five months of August 2002 through December 2002. The 2001 year was pre merger and therefore no Conectiv Power Delivery or Conectiv Energy operations are included. Accordingly, the years are not comparable. The decrease in Other Non Regulated other (expenses) during 2002 primarily resulted from $18.1 million in reduced equity losses on Pepcoms investment in Starpower due to its improved margins, lower selling and administrative expenses, and the favorable impact of the termination of the requirement to amortize goodwill, partially offset by lower income of approximately $9 million earned on other investments. "Corporate and Other" in 2002 primarily represents unallocated Pepco Holdings capital costs, such as the acquisition financing and the amortization of "purchase accounting" related adjustments to the fair value of non regulated Conectiv assets and liabilities as of August 1, 2002. Additionally, this amount includes the write off of certain Pepco software costs related to software that was no longer being used. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) Results for 2003 Compared to 2002 Total consolidated income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2003, was $65.9 million compared to $124.1 million for 2002. A detail of these amounts is as follows: 2003 2002 Change Pepco $69.1 $ 81.7 $(12.6) Conectiv Power Delivery 63.7 20.1 43.6 Conectiv Energy (51.1) 19.4 (70.5) Pepco Energy Services 0.7 3.8 (3.1) Other Non Regulated (10.6) (7.3) (3.3) Corporate and Other (5.9) 6.4 (12.3) Total $65.9 $124.1 33 Pepco Holdings effective tax rate in 2003 and 2002 was 37% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference are state income taxes (net of federal benefit) and the flow through of certain book tax depreciation differences partially offset by the flow through Deferred Investment Tax Credits and the tax benefits related to certain leveraged leases. The 2003 amounts for Conectiv Power Delivery and Conectiv Energy represent their operations for the entire period. The 2002 amounts represent only post merger results and therefore the periods are not comparable. Results for 2002 Compared to 2001 Total consolidated income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2002, was $124.1 million compared to $83.5 million for 2001. A detail of these amounts is as follows: 2002 2001 Change Pepco $ 81.7 $130.9 $(49.2) Conectiv Power Delivery 20.1 20.1 Conectiv Energy 19.4 19.4 Pepco Energy Services 3.8 8.5 (4.7) Other Non Regulated (7.3) (55.9) 48.6 Corporate and Other 6.4 6.4 Total $124.1 $ 83.5 The decrease in Pepcos income tax expense during 2002 resulted from lower taxes as a result of lower interest income and due to the fact that the 2001 amount included taxes incurred on Pepcos generating plant divestiture. The 2002 amounts for Conectiv Power Delivery and Conectiv Energy represent their post merger operations for the five months of August 2002 through December 2002. The 2001 year was pre merger and therefore no Conectiv Power Delivery or Conectiv Energy operations are included. Accordingly, the years are not comparable. Income tax expense for Pepco Energy Services remained relatively stable between years. The decrease in Other Non Regulated income tax (benefit) during 2002 primarily resulted from the approximately $22.9 million tax benefit derived in 2001 from one time impairment write downs associated with the aircraft portfolio and other investments, approximately $5.7 million in tax benefits in 2001 from reduced losses at Pepcom, and a $7.4 million increase in taxes in 2002 derived from lower tax depreciation expense. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY This section discusses Pepco Holdings capital structure, financing activity, cash flow activity, capital spending plans and other uses of capital and sources of capital. 34 Capital Structure The components of Pepco Holdings capital structure, expressed as a percentage of total capitalization (including short term debt and current maturities of long term debt) is shown below as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 (Dollars in Millions). 2003 2002 Common Shareholders Equity $3,003.3 34.7% $2,995.8 33.1% Preferred Stock (a) 108.2 1.2% 110.7 1.2% Trust Preferred Securities (b) % 290.0 3.2% Debentures Issued to Financing Trust (c) 98.0 1.1% % Long Term Debt (d) 5,101.3 58.8% 4,837.7 53.5% Short Term Debt (e) 360.0 4.2% 812.7 9.0% Total $8,670.8 100.0% $9,046.9 100.0% (a) Represents Mandatorily Redeemable Serial Preferred Stock, Serial Preferred Stock, and Redeemable Serial Preferred Stock (b) Represents company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trust which holds solely parent junior subordinated debentures (c) Represents debentures issued to financing trusts and current portion of debentures issued to financing trusts. (d) Excludes capital lease obligations and transition bonds issued by ACE Funding. Includes first mortgage bonds, medium term notes, other long term debt (other than debt issued by ACE Funding), current maturities of long term debt (other than debt issued by ACE Funding), and Variable Rate Demand Bonds. (e) Excludes current maturities of long term debt, capital lease obligations due within one year, and Variable Rate Demand Bonds. Set forth below is a summary of long term financing activity during 2003 for Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries. Pepco Holdings issued 1,787,087 shares of common stock under its Shareholder Dividend Reinvestment Plan and various benefit plans. The proceeds from the issuances were added to PHIs general funds. Pepco Holdings issued $700 million of unsecured long term debt with maturities ranging from 1 year to 7 years. Proceeds of approximately $696 million were used to repay short term debt. Pepco issued $200 million of secured senior notes that mature in 2013. Proceeds of approximately $198 million were used to refinance previously issued higher interest trust preferred securities of $125 million and to repay short term debt of $73 million. DPL issued $33.2 million of tax exempt bonds through the Delaware Economic Development Authority. These tax exempt bonds have maturities ranging from 5 to 35 years. Proceeds of approximately $33 million were used to refinance previously issued higher interest tax exempt bonds. ACE Funding issued $152 million of Transition Bonds with maturities ranging from 8 to 17 years. Proceeds of approximately $151 million will be used to recover the stranded costs associated with an ACE generation asset and transaction costs. 35 Conectiv Bethlehem, LLC, a subsidiary of Conectiv Energy, borrowed $148.2 million under a credit agreement established to finance the construction of the mid merit power plant located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Working Capital At December 31, 2003, Pepco Holdings current assets on a consolidated basis totaled $1.6 billion, whereas current liabilities totaled $2.1 billion. Current liabilities include $.4 billion in long term debt due within one year and an additional $.5 billion of short term debt. The following is an analysis of Pepco Holdings short term debt as of December 31, 2003 and 2002. As of December 31, 2003 ($ in Millions) Type PHI Pepco DPL ACE ACE Funding Conectiv Energy PCI Conectiv Pepco Holdings Consolidated Variable Rate Demand Bonds $ $ $ 104.8 $22.6 $ $ 31.0 $ $ $158.4 Current Portion of Long Term Debt 200.0 7.0 11.0 25.9 86.0 50.0 379.9 Construction Loan 310.0 310.0 Floating Rate Note 50.0 50.0 Commercial Paper Total $200.0 $50.0 $111.8 $33.6 $25.9 $341.0 $86.0 $50.0 $898.3 As of December 31, 2002 ($ in Millions) Type PHI Pepco DPL ACE ACE Funding Conectiv Energy PCI Conectiv Pepco Holdings Consolidated Variable Rate Demand Bonds $ $ $ 104.8 $22.6 $ $ 31.0 $ $ $ 158.4 Current Portion of Long Term Debt 50.0 87.2 70.2 14.4 134.5 50.0 406.3 Construction Loan 161.8 161.8 Floating Rate Note 200.0 200.0 Commercial Paper 410.9 40.0 450.9 Total $410.9 $90.0 $192.0 $92.8 $14.4 $192.8 $134.5 $250.0 $1,377.4 Cash Flow Activity During 2003, $661.4 million in cash was provided from operating activities, $232.5 million in cash was used by investing activities, and $411.1 million of cash was used by financing activities, resulting in an increase of $17.8 million in cash and cash equivalents during the year to $100.3 million. At December 31, 2002, cash and cash equivalents were $82.5 million. Because the purchase method of accounting was used to record the August 1, 2002 acquisition of Conectiv by Pepco, PHIs cash flow activities during the years 2003, 2002, and 2001 are not comparable. 36 Capital Requirements Construction Expenditures Pepco Holdings construction expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $592 million of which $392 million was related to its power delivery businesses and the remainder related to Conectiv Energy. For the five year period 2004 through 2008, total construction expenditures are projected to be approximately $2.0 billion, of which approximately $1.9 billion is related to the power delivery businesses. This amount includes estimated costs for environmental compliance by PHIs subsidiaries. See Item 1 "Business Environmental Matters." Pepco Holdings expects to fund these expenditures through internally generated cash from the power delivery businesses. Dividends Pepco Holdings annual dividend rate on its common stock is determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration, among other factors, current and possible future developments that may affect PHIs income and cash flows. PHIs Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of 25 cents per share of common stock payable on March 31, 2003, June 30, 2003, September 30, 2003 and December 31, 2003. Under PUHCA, PHI is prohibited, without SEC approval, from paying dividends on its common stock from capital or unearned surplus. PHI generates no operating income of its own. Accordingly, its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders depends on dividends received from its subsidiaries. In addition to their future financial performance, the ability of PHIs direct and indirect subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to limits imposed by: (i) state corporate and regulatory laws, which impose limitations on the funds that can be used to pay dividends and, in the case of regulatory laws, as applicable, may require the prior approval of the relevant utility regulatory commissions before dividends can be paid; (ii) PUHCA, which prohibits a subsidiary of a registered public utility holding company from paying a dividend out of capital or unearned surplus without the prior approval of the SEC; (iii) the prior rights of holders of existing and futu re preferred stock, mortgage bonds and other long term debt issued by the subsidiaries, and any other restrictions imposed in connection with the incurrence of liabilities, and (iv) certain provisions of the charters of Pepco, DPL and ACE, which impose restrictions on payment of common stock dividends for the benefit of preferred stockholders. Pepcos articles of incorporation and DPLs certificate and articles of incorporation each contains provisions restricting the amount of dividends that can be paid on common stock when preferred stock is outstanding if the applicable companys capitalization ratio is less than 25%. For this purpose, the capitalization ratio is equal to (i) common stock capital plus surplus, divided by (ii) total capital (including long term debt) plus surplus. In addition, DPLs certificate and articles of incorporation and ACEs certificate of incorporation each provides that if preferred stock is outstanding, no dividends may be paid on common stock if, after payment, the applicable companys common stock capital plus surplus would be less than the involuntary liquidation value of the outstanding preferred stock. Currently, none of these charter restrictions limits the ability of Pepco, DPL or ACE to pay dividends. 37 Pension Funding Pepco Holdings has a noncontributory retirement plan (the Retirement Plan) that covers substantially all employees of Pepco, DPL, ACE and certain employees of other Pepco Holdings subsidiaries. Following the consummation of the acquisition of Conectiv by Pepco on August 1, 2002, the Pepco General Retirement Plan and the Conectiv Retirement Plan were merged into the Retirement Plan on December 31, 2002. The provisions and benefits of the merged Retirement Plan applicable to Pepco employees are identical to those in the original Pepco plan and the provisions and benefits applicable to DPL and ACE employees are identical to those in the original Conectiv plan. As of the 2003 valuation, the Retirement Plan satisfied the minimum funding requirements of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) without any additional funding. However, PHIs funding policy with regard to the Retirement Plan is to maintain a funding level in excess of 100% of its accrued benefit obligation. In 2003 and 2002, PHI made discretionary tax deductible cash contributions to the Retirement Plan in accordance with its funding policy. In 2003, the accumulated benefit obligation for the Retirement Plan increased over 2002, primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to value the accumulated benefit obligation, which reflected the declining interest rate environment in 2003. However, the financial markets experienced a recovery during 2003, and the Retirement Plan assets achieved returns in excess of the levels assumed in the valuation. As a result of the combination of these factors, in October 2003 PHI contributed a total of $50 million (of which $30 million was funded by Pepco and $20 million funded by ACE) to the Retirement Plan. The contribution was made to ensure that under reasonable assumptions, the funding level at year end would be in excess of 100% of the accrued benefit obligation. In 2002, PHI contributed a total of $35 million (all of which was funded by Pepco) to the Retirement Plan. PHI currently estimates that no contributions will be required i n 2004 to maintain a funding level in excess of 100% of the accumulated benefit obligation. Contractual Obligations And Commercial Commitments Summary information about Pepco Holdings consolidated contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2003, is as follows: Contractual Maturity Obligation Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years (Dollars in Millions) Short term debt $ 360.0 $ 360.0 $ $ $ Variable rate demand bonds 158.4 158.4 Long term debt 5,520.1 379.9 947.7 1,151.1 3,041.4 Preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption 45.0 2.5 5.0 37.5 Capital and operating leases 392.6 41.7 84.6 84.8 181.5 Purchase power contracts 1,713.8 465.9 762.9 485.0 Total $8,189.9 $1,408.4 $1,800.2 $1,758.4 $3,222.9 38 Third Party Guarantees, Indemnifications and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Pepco Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries have various financial and performance guarantees and indemnification obligations which are entered into in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties as discussed below. As of December 31, 2003, Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries were parties to a variety of agreements pursuant to which they were guarantors for standby letters of credit, performance residual value, and other commitments and obligations. The fair value of these commitments and obligations was not required to be recorded in Pepco Holdings consolidated Balance Sheets; however, certain energy marketing obligations of Conectiv Energy were recorded. The commitments and obligations, in millions of dollars, were as follows: Guarantor PHI Conectiv PCI Total Energy marketing obligations of Conectiv Energy (1) $118.3 $19.2 $ $137.5 Energy procurement obligations of Pepco Energy Services (1) 6.6 6.6 Standby letters of credit of Pepco Holdings (2) 12.7 12.7 Guaranteed lease residual values (3) 5.4 5.4 Loan agreement (4) 13.1 13.1 Construction performance guarantees (5) 4.6 4.6 Other (6) 14.9 4.3 5.8 25.0 Total $165.6 $33.5 $5.8 $204.9 1. Pepco Holdings and Conectiv have contractual commitments for performance and related payments of Conectiv Energy and Pepco Energy Services to counterparties related to routine energy sales and procurement obligations, including requirements under BGS contracts for ACE. 2. Pepco Holdings has issued standby letters of credit of $12.7 million on behalf of subsidiary operations related to Conectiv Energys competitive energy activities and third party construction performance. These standby letters of credit were put into place in order to allow the subsidiaries the flexibility needed to conduct business with counterparties without having to post substantial cash collateral. While the exposure under these standby letters of credit is $12.7 million, Pepco Holdings does not expect to fund the full amount. 3. Subsidiaries of Conectiv have guaranteed residual values in excess of fair value related to certain equipment and fleet vehicles held through lease agreements. As of December 31, 2003, obligations under the guarantees were approximately $5.4 million. Assets leased under agreements subject to residual value guarantees are typically for periods ranging from 2 years to 10 years. Historically, payments under the guarantee have not been made by the guarantor as, under normal conditions, the contract runs to full term at which time the residual value is minimal. As such, PHI believes the likelihood of requiring payment under the guarantee is remote. 39 4. Pepco Holdings has issued a guarantee on behalf of a subsidiarys 50% unconsolidated investment in a limited liability company for repayment of borrowings under a loan agreement of approximately $13.1 million. 5. Conectiv has performance obligations of $4.6 million relating to obligations to third party suppliers of equipment. 6. Other guarantees comprise: o Pepco Holdings has guaranteed payment of a bond issued by a subsidiary of $14.9 million. Pepco Holdings does not expect to fund the full amount of the exposure under the guarantee. o Conectiv has guaranteed a subsidiary building lease of $4.3 million. PHI does not expect to fund the full amount of the exposure under the guarantee. o PCI has guaranteed facility rental obligations related to contracts entered into by Starpower. In addition, PCI has agreed to indemnify RCN for 50% of any payments RCN makes under Starpowers franchise and construction performance bonds. As of December 31, 2003, the guarantees cover the remaining $3.7 million in rental obligations and $2.1 million in franchise and construction performance bonds issued. In addition, in connection with the Conectiv Bethlehem revolving credit agreement, Conectiv provides a guarantee associated with Conectiv Energys agreement to purchase energy and capacity from Conectiv Bethlehem and other guarantees related to obligations of Pepco Holdings subsidiaries under agreements related to constructing and operating the Conectiv Bethlehem mid merit plant. Generally, Conectivs guarantee obligations do not exceed the amount of the debt outstanding under the credit agreement and do not guarantee Conectiv Bethlehems obligation to repay the debt. As of December 31, 2003, the outstanding balance under the Conectiv Bethlehem credit facility was $310 million. Pepco Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries have entered into various indemnification agreements related to purchase and sale agreements and other types of contractual agreements with vendors and other third parties. These indemnification agreements typically cover environmental, tax, litigation and other matters, as well as breaches of representations, warranties and covenants set forth in the agreements. Typically, claims may be made by third parties under these indemnification agreements over various periods of time depending on the nature of the claim. The maximum potential exposure under these indemnification agreements can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount depending on the nature of the claim and the particular transaction. The total maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements is not estimable due to several factors, including uncertainty as to whether or when claims may be made under these indemnities. Contractual Arrangements with Credit Rating Triggers or Margining Rights Under certain contractual arrangements entered into by PHIs subsidiaries in connection with competitive energy and other transactions, the affected company may be required to provide cash collateral or letters of credit as security for its contractual obligations if the credit ratings of the applicable company are downgraded one or more levels. In the event of a downgrade, the amount required to be posted would depend on the amount of the underlying contractual obligation existing at the time of the downgrade. As 40 of December 31, 2003, a one level downgrade in the credit rating of PHI and all of its affected subsidiaries would have required PHI and such subsidiaries to provide aggregate cash collateral or letters of credit of approximately up to $92 million. An additional approximately $290 million of aggregate cash collateral or letters of credit would have been required in the event of subsequent downgrades to below investment grade. Many of the contractual arrangements entered into by PHIs subsidiaries in connection with competitive energy activities include margining rights pursuant to which the PHI subsidiary or a counterparty may request collateral if the market value of the contractual obligations reaches levels that are in excess of the credit thresholds established in the applicable arrangements. Pursuant to these margining rights, the affected PHI subsidiary may receive, or be required to post, collateral due to energy price movements. As of December 31, 2003, Pepco Holdings subsidiaries engaged in competitive energy activities were in receipt of (a net holder of) cash collateral in the amount of $22.8 million in connection with their competitive energy activities. Environmental Remediation Obligations PHIs accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2003 include approximately $24.8 million, of which $5.5 million is expected to be incurred in 2004, for potential cleanup and other costs related to sites at which an operating subsidiary is a potentially responsible party, is alleged to be a third party contributor, or has made a decision to clean up contamination on its own property. For information regarding projected expenditures for environmental control facilities, see "Business Environmental Matters." The principal environmental remediation obligations as of December 31, 2003, were: $8.3 million, of which $1.3 million is expected to be incurred in 2004, payable by DPL for remediation and other costs associated with environmental contamination that resulted from an oil release at the Indian River power plant that was sold on June 22, 2001, reflecting the terms of a related consent agreement reached with the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control during 2001. As a result of the discontinuation of the second competitive bidding process for ACEs fossil fuel fired generating stations, ACE anticipates that it will incur costs of approximately $7 million and $2.6 million, respectively, in environmental remediation costs associated with its Deepwater Generating Station and its B.L. England Generating Station. ACE established a $7 million reserve for the Deepwater related portion of these remediation costs. In March 2004, ACE transferred the ownership of the Deepwater generation plant, along with the reserve for Deepwater related remediation costs to Conectiv Energy which has assumed responsibility for the remediation at Deepwater. ACE continues to be responsible for the B.L. England related remediation costs. In 2004, Conectiv Energy expects to incur approximately $650,000 in such costs associated with Deepwater and Ace expects to incur $650,000 million in such costs associated with B.L. England. ACE anticipates that costs of cleanup, remediation and restoration in response to a December 2003 oil release at B.L. England will be approximately $1.2 million, of which $750,000 has been accrued as a liability. ACE expects to incur $750,000 associated with the B.L. England oil release in 2004. $1.7 million accrued by Pepco to meet its share of the costs associated with remediation of the Metal Bank/Cottman Avenue site in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 41 Sources Of Capital Pepco Holdings sources to meet its long term funding needs, such as capital expenditures and new investments, and its short term funding needs, such as working capital and the temporary funding of long term funding needs, include internally generated funds, securities issuances and bank financing under new or existing facilities. PHIs ability to generate funds from its operations and to access capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties. See "Risk Factors" for a discussion of important factors that may impact these sources of capital. Internally Generated Cash The primary source of Pepco Holdings internally generated funds is the cash flow generated by its regulated utility subsidiaries in the power delivery business. A discussion of cash flows for 2003 is included above. Short Term Funding Sources Pepco Holdings and its regulated utility subsidiaries have traditionally used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs, such as commercial paper, short term notes and bank lines of credit. Proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs but may also be used to temporarily fund long term capital requirements. Pepco Holdings maintains an ongoing commercial paper program of up to $700 million. Pepco, DPL, and ACE have ongoing commercial paper programs of up to $300 million, up to $275 million, and up to $250 million, respectively. The commercial paper notes can be issued with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issue. In July 2003, Pepco Holdings, Pepco, DPL and ACE entered into (i) a three year working capital credit facility with an aggregate credit limit of $550 million and (ii) a 364 day working capital credit facility with an aggregate credit limit of $550 million. Pepco Holdings credit limit under these facilities is $700 million, and the credit limit of each of Pepco, DPL and ACE under these facilities is the lower of $300 million and the maximum amount of short term debt authorized by the appropriate state commission, except that the aggregate amount of credit utilized by Pepco, DPL and ACE at any given time under these facilities may not exceed $400 million. Funds borrowed under these facilities are available for general corporate purposes. Either credit facility also can be used as credit support for the commercial paper programs of the respective companies. The three year and 364 day credit agreements contain customary financial and other cov enants that, if not satisfied, could result in the acceleration of repayment obligations under the agreements or restrict the ability of the companies to borrow under the agreements. Among these covenants is the requirement that each borrowing company maintain a ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization of 65% or less, computed in accordance with the terms of the credit agreements. As of December 31, 2003, the applicable ratios for Pepco Holdings, Pepco, DPL and ACE were 60.0%. 55.0%, 48.4% and 47.9%, respectively. The credit agreements also contain a number of customary events of default that could result in the acceleration of repayment obligations under the agreements, including (i) the failure of any borrowing company or any of its significant subsidiaries to pay when due, or the acceleration of, certain indebtedness under other borrowing arrangements, (ii) certain bankruptcy events, judgments or decrees against any borrowing company or its significant subsidiaries, and (iii) a change in cont rol (as defined in the credit agreements) of Pepco 42 Holdings or the failure of Pepco Holdings to own all of the voting stock of Pepco, DPL and ACE. Conectiv Bethlehem entered into a credit agreement with various banks and financial institutions in June 2002 in connection with the construction of the Bethlehem mid merit power plant. Under this agreement, Conectiv Bethlehem may borrow up to $365 million as a construction loan and convert the construction loan to a term loan after completing the construction and testing of its mid merit power plant. Conectiv Bethlehem expects that the construction loan will convert to a term loan in 2004 and that the term loan period will be approximately two years. Borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a variable interest rate and are secured by a lien on the membership interests of Conectiv Bethlehem and all tangible, intangible and real property of Conectiv Bethlehem. Conectiv Bethlehem entered into an interest rate swap agreement which effectively converted the variable interest rate on 75% of the expected loan balance to a fixed rate of 4.15%. As of December 31, 2003, the outstanding balance under the credit agreement was $310 million. The credit agreement contains a number of events of default, including defaults by Conectiv or Conectiv Bethlehem on other debt, events of bankruptcy, Conectiv Bethlehems loss of collateral, defaults by Conectiv Bethlehem under agreements related to the project such as the power purchase agreement between Conectiv Energy and Conectiv Bethlehem, and material adverse changes in Conectiv Bethlehems regulatory status. Long Term Funding Sources The sources of long term funding for PHI and its subsidiaries are the issuance of debt and equity securities and borrowing under long term credit agreements. Proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements, such as capital expenditures and new investments, and to refund or refinance existing securities. PUHCA Restrictions Because Pepco Holdings is a public utility holding company registered under PUHCA, it must obtain SEC approval to issue securities. PUHCA also prohibits Pepco Holdings from borrowing from its subsidiaries. Under an SEC Financing Order dated July 31, 2002 (the Financing Order), Pepco Holdings is authorized to issue equity, preferred securities and debt securities in an aggregate amount not to exceed $3.5 billion through an authorization period ending June 30, 2005, subject to a ceiling on the effective cost of these funds. Pepco Holdings is also authorized to enter into guarantees to third parties or otherwise provide credit support with respect to obligations of its subsidiaries for up to $3.5 billion. Of this amount, only $1.75 billion may be on behalf of subsidiaries engaged in energy marketing activities. Pepco Holdings may issue common stock to satisfy its obligations under its Shareholder Dividend Reinvestment Plan and various employee benefit plans. Under the Financing Order, Pepco Holdings is limited to issuing no more than an aggregate of 20 million shares of common stock under its Shareholder Dividend Reinvestment Plan and employee benefit plans during the period ending June 30, 2005. The Financing Order requires that, in order to issue debt or equity securities, including commercial paper, Pepco Holdings must maintain a ratio of common stock equity to total capitalization (consisting of common stock, preferred stock, if any, long term debt and short term debt) of at least 30 percent. At December 31, 2003, Pepco Holdings common equity ratio was 32.5 percent. The Financing Order also requires that all rated securities issued 43 by Pepco Holdings be rated "investment grade" by at least one nationally recognized rating agency. Accordingly, if Pepco Holdings common equity ratio were less than 30 percent or if no nationally recognized rating agency rated a security investment grade, Pepco Holdings could not issue the security without first obtaining an amendment to the Financing Order from the SEC. If an amendment to the Financing Order is required to enable Pepco Holdings or any of its subsidiaries to effect a financing, there is no certainty that such an amendment could be obtained or as to the timing of SEC action. The failure to obtain timely relief from the SEC, in such circumstances, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries. The foregoing financing limitations also generally apply to Pepco, DPL, ACE and certain other Pepco Holdings subsidiaries. Money Pool Pepco Holdings has received SEC authorization under PUHCA to establish the Pepco Holdings system money pool. The money pool is a cash management mechanism used by Pepco Holdings to manage the short term investment and borrowing requirements of the PHI subsidiaries that participate in the money pool. Pepco Holdings may invest in but not borrow from the money pool. Eligible subsidiaries with surplus cash may deposit those funds in the money pool. Deposits in the money pool are guaranteed by Pepco Holdings. Eligible subsidiaries with cash requirements may borrow from the money pool. Borrowings from the money pool are unsecured. Depositors in the money pool receive, and borrowers from the money pool pay, an interest rate based primarily on Pepco Holdings short term borrowing rate. Pepco Holdings deposits funds in the money pool to the extent that the pool has insufficient funds to meet the borrowing needs of its participants, which may require Pepco Holdings to borrow funds for deposit from external sources. Consequently, Pepco Holdings external borrowing requirements fluctuate based on the amount of funds required to be deposited in the money pool. REGULATORY AND OTHER MATTERS Relationship with Mirant Corporation In 2000, Pepco sold substantially all of its electricity generation assets to Mirant Corporation, formerly Southern Energy, Inc. As part of the sale, Pepco entered into several ongoing contractual arrangements with Mirant and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, Mirant). On July 14, 2003, Mirant Corporation and most of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas (the Bankruptcy Court). Under bankruptcy law, a debtor generally may, with authorization from a bankruptcy court, assume or reject executory contracts. A rejection of an executory contract entitles the counterparty to file a claim as an unsecured creditor against the bankruptcy estate for damages incurred due to the rejection of the contract. In a bankruptcy proceeding, a debtor can normally restructure some or all of its pre petition liabilities. Depending on the outcome of the matters discussed below, the Mirant bankruptcy could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of Pepco Holdings and Pepco. However, management currently believes that Pepco Holdings and Pepco currently have sufficient cash, cash flow and borrowing capacity under their credit facilities and in the capital markets 44 to be able to satisfy the additional cash requirements that are expected to arise due to the Mirant bankruptcy. Accordingly, management does not anticipate that the Mirant bankruptcy will impair the ability of Pepco Holdings or Pepco to fulfill their contractual obligations or to fund projected capital expenditures. On this basis, management currently does not believe that the Mirant bankruptcy will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of either company. Transition Power Agreements As part of the asset purchase and sale agreement for the Pepco generation assets (the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement), Pepco and Mirant entered into Transition Power Agreements for Maryland and the District of Columbia, respectively (collectively, the TPAs). Under these agreements, Mirant was obligated to supply Pepco with all of the capacity and energy needed to fulfill its standard offer service obligations in Maryland through June 2004 and its standard offer service obligations in the District of Columbia into January 2005, in each case at rates that were lower than the rates that Pepco charges to its customers. The original rates under the TPAs were less than the prevailing market rates. At the time Mirant filed for bankruptcy, the purchase prices for energy and capacity under the TPAs were below the prevailing market rates. To avoid the potential rejection of the TPAs Pepco and Mirant Corporation and its affiliate Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, LP (the Mirant Parties) entered into a settlement agreement, which was approved by the Bankruptcy Court on November 19, 2003 (the Settlement Agreement). Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Mirant Parties have assumed both of the TPAs and the TPAs have been amended, effective October 1, 2003, to increase the purchase price of energy thereunder as described below. The Settlement Agreement also provides that Pepco has an allowed, pre petition general unsecured claim against each of the Mirant Parties in the amount of $105 million (the Pepco TPA Claim), and has the right to assert the Pepco TPA Claim against other Mirant debtors. On December 15, 2003, Pepco filed Proofs of Claim in the amount of $105 million against the appropriate Mirant debtors. In accordance with the Settlement Agreement, the purchase price of energy under the TPAs has increased from $35.50 to $41.90 per megawatt hour during summer months (May 1 through September 30) and from $25.30 to $31.70 per megawatt hour during winter months (October 1 through April 30) under the District of Columbia TPA and has increased from $40.00 to $46.40 per megawatt hour during summer months and from $22.20 to $28.60 per megawatt hour during winter months under the Maryland TPA. Under the amended TPAs, the purchase prices paid by Pepco for capacity in the District of Columbia and Maryland remain $3.50 per megawatt hour and the charge paid by Pepco for certain ancillary services remain $.50 per megawatt hour. The amendments to the TPAs have resulted in an increase in the average purchase price to Pepco for energy from approximately 3.4 cents per kilowatt hour under the original terms of the TPAs to an average purchase price of approximatel y 4.0 cents per kilowatt hour. The revenues produced by the currently approved tariff rates that Pepco charges its customers for providing standard offer service average approximately 4.1 cents per kilowatt hour. Pepco estimates that, as a result of the price increases, it will pay Mirant an additional $105 million for the purchase of energy beginning October 1, 2003 through the remaining terms of the TPAs. These payments will be offset by a reduction of payments by Pepco to customers for the period 2003 through 2006 of approximately $45 million pursuant to the generation procurement credit established pursuant to regulatory settlements entered 45 into in the District of Columbia and Maryland under which Pepco and its customers share any margin between the price paid by Pepco to procure standard offer service and the price paid by customers for standard offer service. As a result, Pepco currently anticipates that it will incur a net additional cash outlay of approximately $60 million due to the amendments of the respective TPAs. The foregoing estimates are based on current service territory load served by competitive suppliers and by standard offer service and does not include financing costs, all of which could be subject to fluctuation. The amount, if any, that Pepco will be able to recover from the Mirant bankruptcy estate in respect of the Pepco TPA Claim will depend on the amount of assets available for distribution to creditors. At the current stage of the bankruptcy proceeding, there is insufficient information to determine the amount, if any, that Pepco might be able to recover from the Mirant bankruptcy estate. No receivable has been recorded in Pepcos accounting records in respect of the Pepco TPA Claim. Any recovery would be shared with customers pursuant to the generation procurement credit. Power Purchase Agreements Under agreements with FirstEnergy Corp., formerly Ohio Edison (FirstEnergy), and Allegheny Energy, Inc., both entered into in 1987, Pepco is obligated to purchase from FirstEnergy 450 megawatts of capacity and energy annually through December 2005 (the FirstEnergy PPA). Under an agreement with Panda, entered into in 1991, Pepco is obligated to purchase from Panda 230 megawatts of capacity and energy annually through 2021 (the Panda PPA). In each case, the purchase price is substantially in excess of current market prices. As a part of the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, Pepco entered into a "back to back" arrangement with Mirant. Under this arrangement, Mirant is obligated, among other things, to purchase from Pepco the capacity and energy that Pepco is obligated to purchase under the FirstEnergy PPA and the Panda PPA at a price equal to the price Pepco is obligated to pay under the PPAs (the PPA Related Obligations). Pepco Pre Petition Claims When Mirant filed its bankruptcy petition on July 14, 2003, Mirant had unpaid obligations to Pepco of approximately $29 million, consisting primarily of payments due to Pepco in respect of the PPA Related Obligations (the Mirant Pre Petition Obligations). The Mirant Pre Petition Obligations constitute part of the indebtedness for which Mirant is seeking relief in its bankruptcy proceeding. Pepco has filed Proofs of Claim in the Mirant bankruptcy proceeding in the amount of approximately $26 million to recover this indebtedness; however, the amount of Pepcos recovery, if any, is uncertain. The $3 million difference between Mirants unpaid obligation to Pepco and the $26 million Proofs of Claim filed by Pepco primarily represents a TPA settlement adjustment which is included in the $105 million Proofs of Claim filed by Pepco on December 15, 2003 against the Mirant debtors. In view of this uncertainty, Pepco, in the third quarter of 2003 , expensed $14.5 million ($8.7 million after tax) to establish a reserve against the $29 million receivable from Mirant. The amount expensed represents Pepcos estimate of the possible outcome in bankruptcy, although the amount ultimately recoverable could be higher or lower. Mirants Attempt to Reject the PPA Related Obligations On August 28, 2003, Mirant filed with the Bankruptcy Court a motion seeking authorization to reject its PPA Related Obligations. Mirants motion 46 also sought injunctions to prohibit Pepco from initiating, or encouraging any person or entity to initiate, any proceedings before the FERC that seek to require Mirant to perform the PPA Related Obligations and to prohibit FERC from taking any action to require Mirant to perform the PPA Related Obligations. On September 25, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order stating that it was not necessary to issue an injunction against Pepco because the automatic stay provisions of the Bankruptcy Code prohibit Pepco from commencing or continuing any judicial or administrative proceedings against Mirant. The Bankruptcy Courts order did grant a preliminary injunction that prohibits FERC from (i) taking any action to require or coerce Mirant to abide by the terms of the PPA Related Obligations or commencing or continuing any proceeding outside of the Bankruptcy Court with respect to the PPA Related Obligations and (ii) taking any action, or encouraging any person or entity to take an action, to require or coerce Mirant to abide by the terms of the TPAs. The Bankruptcy Court also ordered Mirant to continue to perform the PPA Related Obligations and its obligations under the TPAs until relieved of those obligations by an order of an appropriate court. Upon motions filed by Pepco and FERC, on October 9, 2003, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas (the District Court) withdrew jurisdiction over both the rejection and preliminary injunction proceedings from the Bankruptcy Court. On December 23, 2003, the District Court denied Mirants motion to reject the PPA Related Obligations. On January 5, 2004 Mirant filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (the Circuit Court) a notice of appeal of the District Courts December 23 decision. On January 6, 2004, The Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Mirant Corporation (the Creditors Committee) filed with the Circuit Court a separate notice of appeal of the December 23 decision. Also on January 6, 2004, the District Court entered an order dissolving all injunctive relief granted by the Bankruptcy Court in respect of the PPA Related Obligations, and Mirant and the Creditors Committee each subsequently filed a motion with the Circuit Court for a stay of the dissolution order pending resolution of the appeals, as well as motions to expedite the appeals. On January 23, 2004, the Circuit Court denied Mirants and the Creditors Committees motions to expedite the appeal. On January 26, 2004, the Circuit Court denied Mirants and the Creditors Committees motions to stay the District Courts Order. Oral argument will be scheduled the week of May 3, 2004. Pepco is exercising all available legal remedies and vigorously opposing Mirants continued attempts to reject the PPA Related Obligations in order to protect the interests of its customers and shareholders. While Pepco believes that it has substantial legal bases to oppose the attempt to reject the agreements, the outcome of Mirants efforts to reject the PPA Related Obligations is uncertain. In accordance with the Bankruptcy Courts September 25 order, Mirant is continuing to perform the PPA Related Obligations pending the resolution of the ongoing proceedings. However, if Mirant ultimately is successful in rejecting, and is otherwise permitted to stop performing the PPA Related Obligations, Pepco could be required to repay to Mirant, for the period beginning on the effective date of the rejection (which date could be prior to the date of the courts order and possibly as early as September 18, 2003) and ending on the date Mirant is entitled to cease its purchases of energy and capacity from Pepco, all amounts paid by Mirant to Pepco in respect of the PPA Related Obligations, less an amount equal to the price at which Mirant resold the purchased energy and capacity. Pepco estimates that the 47 amount it could be required to repay to Mirant in the unlikely event September 18, 2003, is determined to be the effective date of rejection, as of March 1, 2004, is approximately $51.4 million. This repayment would entitle Pepco to file a claim against the bankruptcy estate in an amount equal to the amount repaid. Mirant has also asked the Bankruptcy Court to require Pepco to disgorge all amounts paid by Mirant to Pepco in respect of the PPA Related Obligations, less an amount equal to the price at which Mirant resold the purchased energy and capacity, for the period July 14, 2003 (the date on which Mirant filed its bankruptcy petition) to September 18, 2003, on the theory that Mirant did not receive value for those payments. Pepco estimates that the amount it would be required to repay to Mirant on the disgorgement theory is approximately $22.8 million. Pepco believes a claim based on this theory should be entitled to administrative expense status for which comp lete recovery could be expected. If Pepco were required to repay any such amounts for either period, the payment would be expensed at the time the payment is made. The following are estimates prepared by Pepco of its additional exposure if Mirants motion to reject its PPA Related Obligations ultimately is successful. These estimates are based in part on current market prices and forward price estimates for energy and capacity, and do not include financing costs, all of which could be subject to significant fluctuation. The estimates assume no recovery from the Mirant bankruptcy estate and no regulatory recovery, either of which would mitigate the effect of the estimated loss. Pepco does not consider it realistic to assume that there will be no such recoveries. Based on these assumptions, Pepco estimates that its pre tax exposure as of March 1, 2004, representing the loss of the future benefit of the PPA Related Obligations to Pepco, is as follows: If Pepco were required to purchase capacity and energy from FirstEnergy commencing as of March 1, 2004, at the rates provided in the PPA (with an average price per kilowatt hour of approximately 6.1 cents) and resold the capacity and energy at market rates projected, given the characteristics of the FirstEnergy PPA, to be approximately 4.5 cents per kilowatt hour, Pepco estimates that it would cost approximately $50 million for the remainder of 2004, and $56 million in 2005, the last year of the FirstEnergy PPA. If Pepco were required to purchase capacity and energy from Panda commencing as of March 1, 2004, at the rates provided in the PPA (with an average price per kilowatt hour of approximately 15.6 cents), and resold the capacity and energy at market rates projected, given the characteristics of the Panda PPA, to be approximately 6.9 cents per kilowatt hour, Pepco estimates that it would cost approximately $33 million for the remainder of 2004, $38 million in 2005, and $36 million in 2006 and approximately $35 million to $43 million annually thereafter through the 2021 contract termination date. The ability of Pepco to recover from the Mirant bankruptcy estate in respect of the Mirant Pre Petition Obligations and damages if the PPA Related Obligations are successfully rejected will depend on whether Pepcos claims are allowed, the amount of assets available for distribution to creditors and Pepcos priority relative to other creditors. At the current stage of the bankruptcy proceeding, there is insufficient information to determine the amount, if any, that Pepco might be able to recover from the Mirant bankruptcy estate, whether the recovery would be in cash or another form of payment, or the timing of any recovery. 48 If Mirant ultimately is successful in rejecting the PPA Related Obligations and Pepcos full claim is not recovered from the Mirant bankruptcy estate, Pepco may seek authority from the MPSC and the DCPSC to recover its additional costs. Pepco is committed to working with its regulatory authorities to achieve a result that is appropriate for its shareholders and customers. Under the provisions of the settlement agreements approved by the MPSC and the DCPSC in the deregulation proceedings in which Pepco agreed to divest its generation assets under certain conditions, the PPAs were to become assets of Pepcos distribution business if they could not be sold. Pepco believes that, if Mirant ultimately is successful in rejecting the PPA Related Obligations, these provisions would allow the stranded costs of the PPAs that are not recovered from the Mirant bankruptcy estate to be recovered through Pepcos distribution rates. If Pepcos interpretation o f the settlement agreements is confirmed, Pepco expects to be able to establish the amount of its anticipated recovery as a regulatory asset. However, there is no assurance that Pepcos interpretation of the settlement agreements would be confirmed by the respective public service commissions. If the PPA Related Obligations are successfully rejected, and there is no regulatory recovery, Pepco will incur a loss. However, the accounting treatment of such a loss depends on a number of legal and regulatory factors, and is not determinable at this time. The SMECO Agreement As a term of the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, Pepco assigned to Mirant a facility and capacity agreement with Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative, Inc. (SMECO) under which Pepco was obligated to purchase the capacity of an 84 megawatt combustion turbine installed and owned by SMECO at a former Pepco generating station (the SMECO Agreement). The agreement contemplates a monthly payment to SMECO of approximately $.5 million. Pepco is responsible to SMECO for the performance of the SMECO Agreement if Mirant fails to perform its obligations thereunder. At this time, Mirant continues to make post petition payments due to SMECO. Rate Proceedings On February 3, 2003, ACE filed a petition with the NJBPU to increase its electric distribution rates and its Regulatory Asset Recovery Charge (RARC) in New Jersey. The petition was based on actual data for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, and forecasted data for the three months ended December 31, 2002 and sought an overall rate increase of approximately $68.4 million, consisting of an approximately $63.4 million increase in electricity distribution rates and $5 million for recovery of regulatory assets through the RARC. On October 28, 2003, ACE updated the filing with actual data for the full twelve month test year ended December 31, 2002 and made other corrections. The update supported an overall rate increase of approximately $41.3 million, consisting of a $36.8 million increase in electricity distribution rates and a RARC of $4.5 million. This petition is ACEs first increase request for electric distribution rates since 1991. The requested increase would apply to all rate schedules in ACEs tariff. The Ratepayer Advocate filed testimony on January 3, 2004, proposing an annual rate decrease of $11.7 million. Intervenor groups representing industrial users and local generators filed testimony that did not take a position with respect to an overall rate change but their proposals, if implemented, would affect the way in which an overall rate increase or decrease would be applied to the particular rates under which they receive service. ACEs rebuttal testimony, filed February 20, 2004, makes some changes to its October filing and proposes an overall rate increase of 49 approximately $35.1 million, consisting of a $30.6 increase in distribution rates and a $4.5 million increase in the RARC. On July 31, 2003, the NJBPU issued an order transferring to the base rate proceeding consideration of $25.4 million of actual and projected deferred restructuring costs for which ACE was seeking recovery in a separate proceeding, which is discussed below, relating to the restructuring of ACEs electric utility business under the New Jersey Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act (EDECA). In its October 28, 2003 filing, ACE presented testimony supporting recovery of an increase in the amount of deferred restructuring costs recoverable from $25.4 million to $36.1 million, consisting of: (i) $3.7 million associated with BGS costs, (ii) $27.3 million of restructuring transition related costs and (iii) $5.1 of transition costs related to fossil generation divestiture efforts. On December 12, 2003, the NJBPU issued an order also consolidating outstanding issues from several other proceedings into the base rate case proceeding. On December 22, 2003, ACE filed a Motion for Reconsideration in which it suggested that these issues be dealt with in a Phase II to the base rate case to address the outstanding issues identified in the December 12, 2003 Order. After discussion with the parties to the base rate case, it was agreed that a Phase II to the base rate case to these issues, along with the $36.1 million of deferred restructuring costs previously moved into the base rate case, would be initiated in April 2004. ACE cannot predict at this time the outcome of these proceeding. On March 31, 2003, DPL filed with the DPSC for an annual gas base rate increase of $16.8 million, or an increase of 12.7% in total operating revenue for DPLs gas business. The filing included a request for a ROE of 12.5%. DPL is currently authorized a ROE of 11.5% in Delaware. This is the first increase requested for DPLs gas distribution business since 1994. On May 30, 2003, DPL exercised its statutory right to implement an interim base rate increase of $2.5 million, or 1.9% of total operating revenue for DPLs gas business, subject to refund. On October 7, 2003, a settlement agreement was filed with the DPSC that provides for an annual gas base revenue increase of $7.75 million, with a 10.5% ROE, which equates to a 5.8% increase in total revenues for DPLs gas business. The settlement agreement provides that DPL is not required to refund the previously implemented int erim rate increase. In addition, the settlement agreement provides for establishment of an Environmental Surcharge to recover costs associated with remediation of a coal gas site. On December 9, 2003, the DPSC approved the settlement, making the interim $2.5 million increase final with no refunds and implementing an additional $5.25 million increase effective as of December 10, 2003. At the same time the DPSC approved a supplemental settlement which addresses customer service issues in the electric cost of service filing described below. DPL filed on February 13, 2004 for a change in electric ancillary service rates that has an aggregate effect of increasing annual revenues by $13.1 million or 2.4%. This filing was prompted by the increasing ancillary service costs charged to DPL by PJM. The PHI merger agreement, approved by the DPSC in Docket No. 01 194, provides that "Delmarva shall have the right to file to change in Ancillary components of rates to reflect the then applicable ancillary ch arges billed to Delmarva by PJM or successor organization." On February 24, 2004, the DPSC accepted DPLs filing and placed the rates into effect on March 15, 2004, subject to refund. DPL made this filing on February 13, 2004. In future years DPL will make filings to update the analysis of out of pocket environmental costs recoverable through the Environmental Surcharge rate. 50 On March 1, 2002 DPL submitted a cost of service study with the DPSC demonstrating it was not over earning on its electric distribution rates. On October 21, 2003, the DPSC approved a settlement with respect to the March 1, 2002 filing confirming that no increase or decrease in DPLs electric distribution rates was necessary. This settlement was consistent with the provisions of settlement approved by the DPSC in connection with the Pepco and Conectiv merger that provided for no change in DPLs distribution base rates until May 1, 2006. The rate settlement also establishes objectives and procedures to reduce the number of customers whose bills are estimated over 6 or more months due to difficulties in obtaining access to the meter and to establish a reduced interest charge for customers who are paying past due bills under a payment arrangement. The DPSC also approved a supplemental settlement on December 9, 2003, regarding quality of service by DPL. In the supplemental settlement, DPL agreed to additional customer service provisions, including opening full time walk in facilities that accept payments, and standards for call center performance. On August 29, 2003, DPL submitted its annual Gas Cost Recovery (GCR) rate filing to the DPSC. In its filing, DPL sought to increase its GCR rate by approximately 15.8% in anticipation of increasing natural gas commodity costs. The rate, which passes DPLs increased gas costs along to its customers, became effective November 1, 2003 and is subject to refund pending evidentiary hearings that will commence in April 2004. In compliance with the merger settlement approved by the MPSC in connection with the merger of Pepco and Conectiv, on December 4, 2003, DPL and Pepco submitted testimony and supporting schedules to establish electricity distribution rates in Maryland effective July 1, 2004, when the current distribution rate freeze/caps end. DPLs filing demonstrates that it is in an under earning situation and, as allowed in the merger settlement, DPL requested that a temporary rate reduction implemented on July 1, 2003 for non residential customers be terminated effective July 1, 2004. DPL estimates that the termination of the rate reduction would increase its annual revenues by approximately $1.1 million. With limited exceptions, the merger settlement does not permit DPL to file for any additional rate increase until December 31, 2006. Pepcos filing also demonstrates that it is in an under earning situation. However the merger settlement provides that Pepcos distribution rates after July 1, 2004 can only remain the same or be decreased. With limited exceptions, Pepco is not entitled to file for a rate increase until December 31, 2006. Although the outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted, DPL and Pepco each believes that the likelihood that its distribution rate will be reduced as of July 1, 2004 is remote. Stranded Cost Determination and Securitization On January 31, 2003, ACE filed a petition with the NJBPU seeking an administrative determination of stranded costs associated with the B. L. England Generating Station. The net after tax stranded costs included in the petition were approximately $151 million. An administrative determination of the stranded costs was needed due to the cancelled sale of the plant. On July 25, 2003 the NJBPU rendered an oral decision approving the administrative determination of stranded costs at a level of $149.5 million. As a result of this order, ACE reversed $10.0 million ($5.9 million after tax) of previously accrued liability for possible disallowance of stranded costs. This credit to expense is classified as an extraordinary item in PHIs and ACEs Consolidated Statements of Earnings because the original accrual was part of an extraordinary charge resulting from the 51 discontinuation of SFAS No. 71 in conjunction with the deregulation of ACEs energy business in September 1999. On February 5, 2003, the NJBPU issued an order on its own initiative seeking input from ACE and the Ratepayer Advocate as to whether and by how much to reduce the 13% pre tax return that ACE was then authorized to earn on B. L. England. ACE responded on February 18 with arguments that: (1) reduced costs to ratepayers could be achieved legally through timely approvals by the NJBPU of the stranded cost filing made by ACE on January 31, 2003 and a securitization filing made the week of February 10, 2003; and (2) it would be unlawful, perhaps unconstitutional, and a breach of settlement and prior orders for the NJBPU to deny a fair recovery on prudently incurred investment and to do so without evidentiary hearings or other due process. On April 21, 2003, the NJBPU issued an order making the return previously allowed on B. L. England interim, as of the date of the order, and directing that the issue of the appropriate return for B. L. England be included in the stranded cost proceeding. On July 25, 2003, the NJBPU voted to approve a pre tax return reflecting a 9.75% ROE for the period April 21, 2003 through August 1, 2003. The rate authorized by the NJBPU from August 1, 2003, through such time as ACE securitizes the stranded costs was 5.25%, which the NJBPU represented as being approximately equivalent to the securitization rate. On September 25, 2003, the NJBPU issued a written order memorializing its July 25, 2003 decision. On February 14, 2003, ACE filed a Bondable Stranded Costs Rate Order Petition with the NJBPU. The petition requested authority to issue $160 million of Transition Bonds to finance the recovery of stranded costs associated with B. L. England and costs of issuance. On September 25, 2003 the NJBPU issued a bondable stranded cost rate order authorizing the issuance of up to $152 million of Transition Bonds. On December 23, 2003, ACE Funding issued $152 million of Transition Bonds. See "Long Term Debt" above. Restructuring Deferral Pursuant to a July 15, 1999 summary order issued by the NJBPU under EDECA (which was subsequently affirmed by a final decision and order issued March 30, 2001), ACE was obligated to provide basic generation service from August 1, 1999 to at least July 31, 2002 to retail electricity customers in ACEs service territory who did not choose a competitive energy supplier. The order allowed ACE to recover through customer rates certain costs incurred in providing BGS. ACEs obligation to provide BGS was subsequently extended to July 31, 2003. At the allowed rates, for the period August 1, 1999 through July 31, 2003, ACEs aggregate allowed costs exceeded its aggregate revenues from supplying BGS. These under recovered costs were partially offset by a $59.3 million deferred energy cost liability existing as of July 31, 1999 (LEAC Liability) that was related to ACEs Levelized Energy Adjustment Clause and ACEs Demand Side Management Programs. ACE established a regulatory asset in an amount equal to the balance. On August 1, 2002, ACE filed a petition with the NJBPU for the recovery of approximately $176.4 million in actual and projected deferred costs relating to the provision of BGS and other restructuring related costs incurred by ACE over the four year period August 1, 1999 through July 31, 2003. The deferred balance is net of the $59.3 offset for the LEAC Liability. The petition also requests that ACEs rates be reset as of August 1, 2003 so that there will be no under recovery of costs embedded in the rates on or after that date. The increase sought represents an overall 8.4% annual increase in electric rates and is in addition to the base rate 52 increase discussed above. ACEs recovery of the deferred costs is subject to review and approval by the NJBPU in accordance with EDECA. On July 31, 2003, the NJBPU issued a summary order permitting ACE to begin collecting a portion of the deferred costs and to reset rates to recover on going costs incurred as a result of EDECA. The summary order approved the recovery of $125 million of the deferred balance over a ten year amortization period beginning August 1, 2003. The summary order also transferred to ACEs pending base rate case for further consideration approximately $25.4 million of the deferred balance. The NJBPU estimated the overall deferral balance as of July 31, 2003 at $195 million, of which $44.6 million was disallowed recovery by ACE. Since the amounts included in this decision are based on estimates through July 31, 2003, the actual ending deferred cost balance will be subject to review and finalization by the NJPBU and ACE. The approved rates became effective on August 6, 2003. Based on an analysis of the summary order and in accordance with prevailing accounting rules, ACE recorded a charge of $27.5 million ($16.3 million after tax) during the second quarter of 2003. This charge is in addition to amounts previously accrued for disallowance. ACE believes the record does not justify the level of disallowance imposed by the NJBPU. ACE is awaiting the final written order from the NJBPU and is evaluating its options related to this decision. The NJBPUs action is not appealable until a final written order has been issued. Pepco Regulatory Matters Divestiture Cases Final briefs on Pepcos District of Columbia divestiture proceeds sharing application were filed on July 31, 2002 following an evidentiary hearing in June 2002. That application was filed to implement a provision of Pepcos DCPSC approved divestiture settlement that provided for a sharing of any net proceeds from the sale of Pepcos generation related assets. One of the principal issues in the case is whether Pepco should be required to share with customers, on an approximately 50/50 basis, the excess deferred income taxes (EDIT) and accumulated deferred investment tax credits (ADITC) associated with the sold assets and, if so, whether such sharing would violate the normalization provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and its implementing regulations. As of December 31, 2003, the District of Columbia allocated portions of EDIT and ADITC associated with the divested generation assets were, respectively, approximately $6.5 million and $5 .8 million, respectively. Other issues in the proceeding deal with the treatment of internal costs and cost allocations as deductions from the gross proceeds of the divestiture. Pepco believes that a sharing of EDIT and ADITC would violate the normalization rules. If Pepco were required to share EDIT and ADITC and, as a result, the normalization rules were violated, Pepco would be unable to use accelerated depreciation on District of Columbia allocated or assigned property. Pepco, in addition to sharing with customers an amount equal to approximately 50% of the generation related ADITC balance, would have to pay to the IRS an amount equal to Pepcos $5.8 million District of Columbia jurisdictional generation related ADITC balance as well as its District of Columbia jurisdictional transmission and distribution related ADITC balance as of the later of the date a DCPSC order is issued and all rights to appeal have been exhausted or lapsed, or the date the DCPSC order becomes operative. 53 As of December 31, 2003, the District of Columbia jurisdictional transmission and distribution related ADITC balance was approximately $8 million. Pepco believes that its calculation of the District of Columbia customers share of divestiture proceeds is correct. However, depending on the ultimate outcome of this proceeding, Pepco could be required to make additional gain sharing payments to D.C. customers, including the payments described above related to EDIT and ADITC. Such additional payments (which, other than the EDIT and ADITC related payments, cannot be estimated) would be charged to expense in the quarter and year in which a final decision is rendered and could have a material adverse effect on Pepcos and PHIs results of operations for those periods. However, neither PHI nor Pepco believes that additional gain sharing payments, if any, or the ADITC related payments to the IRS, if required, would have a material adverse impact on its financial condition. It is uncertain when the DCPSC will issue a decision. Pepco filed its divestiture proceeds plan application in Maryland in April 2001. Reply briefs were filed in May 2002. The principal issue in the Maryland case is the same EDIT and ADITC sharing issue that was raised in the D.C. case. As of December 31, 2003, the Maryland allocated portions of EDIT and ADITC associated with the divested generation assets were approximately $9.1 million and $10.4 million, respectively. Other issues deal with the treatment of certain costs as deductions from the gross proceeds of the divestiture. On November 21, 2003, the Hearing Examiner in the Maryland proceeding issued a proposed order that concluded that Pepcos Maryland divestiture settlement agreement provided for a sharing between Pepco and customers of the EDIT and ADITC associated with the sold assets. Pepco believes that such a sharing would violate the normalization rules and would result in Pepcos inability to use accelerated depreciation on Mary land allocated or assigned property. If the proposed order is affirmed, Pepco would have to share with its Maryland customers, on an approximately 50/50 basis, the Maryland allocated portion of the generation related EDIT, i.e., $9.1 million, and the generation related ADITC. If such sharing were to violate the normalization rules, Pepco, in addition to sharing with customers an amount equal to approximately 50% of the generation related ADITC balance, would be unable to use accelerated depreciation on Maryland allocated or assigned property. Furthermore, Pepco would have to pay to the IRS an amount equal to Pepcos $10.4 million Maryland jurisdictional generation related ADITC balance, as well as its Maryland retail jurisdictional ADITC transmission and distribution related balance as of the later of the date a MPSC order is issued and all rights to appeal have been exhausted or lapsed, or the date the MPSC order becomes operative. As of December 31, 2003, the Maryland retail jurisdictional t ransmission and distribution related ADITC balance was approximately $12 million. The Hearing Examiner decided all other issues in favor of Pepco, except that only one half of the severance payments that Pepco included in its calculation of corporate reorganization costs should be deducted from the sales proceeds before sharing of the net gain between Pepco and customers. Under Maryland law, if the proposed order is appealed to the MPSC, the proposed order is not a final, binding order of the MPSC and further action by the MPSC is required with respect to this matter. Pepco has appealed the Hearing Examiners decision on the treatment of EDIT and ADITC and corporate reorganization costs to the MPSC. Pepco cannot predict what the outcome of the appeal will be or when the appeal might be decided. Pepco believes that its calculation of the Maryland customers share of divestiture proceeds is correct. However, depending on the ultimate outcome of this proceeding, Pepco could be required to share with its customers approximately 50% of the EDIT and ADITC balances described above and make additional gain sharing payments 54 related to the disallowed severance payments. Such additional payments would be charged to expense in the quarter and year in which a final decision is rendered and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for those periods. However, neither PHI nor Pepco believes that additional gain sharing payments, if any, or the ADITC related payments to the IRS, if required, would have a material adverse impact on its financial condition. Standard Offer Service (SOS) District of Columbia On February 21, 2003, the DCPSC opened a new proceeding to consider issues relating to (a) the establishment of terms and conditions for providing SOS in the District of Columbia after Pepcos obligation to provide SOS terminates on February 7, 2005, and (b) the selecting of a new SOS provider. Under current District of Columbia law, if the DCPSC selects a retail SOS provider (i.e., some entity or entities other than Pepco) to provide SOS after February 7, 2005, it must make the selection(s) before July 2, 2004; however, if the DCPSC decides to have Pepco continue as the SOS provider after February 7, 2005, it need not complete the procurement process before July 2, 2004. The law also allows the selection of Pepco as the SOS provider in the event of insufficient or inadequate bids from potential SOS providers other than Pepco. On December 31, 2003, the DCPSC issued an order which sets forth the terms and conditions for the selection of a new SOS provider(s) and the provision of SOS by Pepco on a contingency basis. On December 31, 2003, the DCPSC also issued an order adopting terms and conditions that would apply if Pepco continues as the SOS provider after February 7, 2005. On January 9, 2004, the DCPSC issued an order in which it requested initial and reply comments by January 29, 2004, and February 9, 2004, respectively, on which SOS model (i.e., the wholesale SOS model, under which Pepco would continue as the SOS provider after February 7, 2005, or the retail model, under which some entity or entities other than Pepco would be the SOS provider after February 7, 2005) would best meet the needs of the DC SOS customers after February 7, 2005. Pepco and most of the other parties in the case filed applications for reconsideration and or clarification of various parts of the two DCPSC orders that set forth the terms and conditions that would apply under the retail and wholesale SOS models. Pepco and most parties also filed initial and reply comments on which SOS model would best serve the needs of the SOS customers in DC. In its comments, Pepco supported the wholesale SOS model. On March 1, 2004, the DCPSC issued an order adopting the wholesale SOS model, i.e., Pepco will continue to be the SOS provider in the District of Columbia after February 7, 2005. The DCPSC also granted in part and denied in part the applications for reconsideration and or clarification of the order adopting the terms and conditions applicable to the wholesale model. Finally, the DCPSC denied as moot the applications for reconsideration and or clarification of the order adopting the terms and conditions applicable to the retail SOS model because the DCPSC adopted the wholesale SOS model. Parties have until March 31, 2004 to apply for reconsideration of the order adopting the wholesale model. Generally, parties have until April 30, 2004 to seek judicial review of the order denying reconsideration of the order that adopted the terms and conditions applicable to the retail SOS 55 model and the order granting in part and denying in part the order adopting the terms and conditions applicable to the wholesale SOS model. Virginia On December 3, 2003, DPL and Conectiv Energy filed with the VSCC an amendment to extend the power supply Agreement for one year, i.e., through December 31, 2004, and on a month to month basis thereafter, as it applies to power supply for DPLs Virginia POLR customers. The VSCC approved the amendment in an order issued on March 1, 2004. After December 31, 2004 either DPL or Conectiv Energy can terminate Conectiv Energys obligation to provide supplies to meet DPLs Virginia POLR obligations by giving 30 days written notice to the other party. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES General The SEC has defined a companys most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations, and which require it to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates represent those estimates and assumptions that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and that have a material impact on financial condition or operating performance. Accounting Policy Choices Pepco Holdings management believes that based on the nature of the businesses that its subsidiaries operate, Pepco Holdings has very little choice regarding the accounting policies it utilizes. For instance, the most significant portion of Pepco Holdings business consists of its regulated utility operations, which are subject to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71 "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71). SFAS No. 71 allows regulated entities, in appropriate circumstances, to establish regulatory assets and liabilities and to defer the income statement impact of certain costs that are expected to be recovered in future rates. However, in the areas that Pepco Holdings is afforded accounting policy choices, management does not believe that the application of different accounting policies than those that it chose would materially impact its financial condition or resu lts of operations. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, such as Statement of Position 94 6 "Disclosure of Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties," requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Examples of significant estimates used by Pepco Holdings include the calculation of future cash flows and fair value amounts for use in goodwill and asset impairment evaluations, fair value calculations (based on estimating market pricing) associated with derivative instruments, pension and other post retirement benefits assumptions, unbilled revenue calculations, and judgment 56 involved with assessing the probability of recovery of regulatory assets. Although Pepco Holdings believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Goodwill Impairment Evaluation Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in its goodwill impairment evaluation process represent "Critical Accounting Estimates" because they (1) may be susceptible to change from period to period because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about the discounting of future cash flows, which are inherently uncertain, (2) actual results could vary from those used in Pepco Holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material, and (3) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on Pepco Holdings assets and the net loss related to an impairment charge could be material. The provisions of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS No. 142), require the evaluation of goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. SFAS No. 142 indicates that if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill, an impairment charge may be necessary. In order to estimate fair value Pepco Holdings may discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate that is commensurate with the risk involved with such an investment, or employ other valuation techniques. Substantially all of Pepco Holdings goodwill was generated in the merger transaction between Pepco and Conectiv during 2002 and was allocated to Pepco Holdings rate regulated entities. During 2003 Pepco Holdings tested its goodwill for impairment as of July 1, 2003. This testing c oncluded that Pepco Holdings goodwill balance was not impaired. Long Lived Assets Impairment Evaluation Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in its long term asset impairment evaluation process represent "Critical Accounting Estimates" because they (1) are highly susceptible to change from period to period because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about undiscounted and discounted future cash flows and fair values, which are inherently uncertain, (2) actual results could vary from those used in Pepco Holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material, and (3) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on Pepco Holdings assets as well as the net loss related to an impairment charge could be material. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" (SFAS No. 144), an impairment loss shall only be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. The asset is deemed to not be recoverable when its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. In order to estimate an assets future cash flows, Pepco Holdings considers historical cash flows. Pepco Holdings uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel costs, legislative initiatives, and operating costs. The process of determining fair value is done consistent with the process described in assessing the fair value of goodwill, discussed above. For a discussion of the impairment t esting 57 results related to Conectiv Energys combustion turbines, refer to Part II, Item 8., Note (13) Conectiv Energy Events, herein. Investment Impairment Evaluation Pepco Holdings is required to evaluate its equity method investments to determine whether or not they are impaired. In accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 18 "The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock" (APB No. 18), the standard for determining whether an impairment must be recorded under APB No. 18 is whether the investment has experienced a loss in value that is considered to be "other than a temporary" decline in value. The evaluation and measurement of impairments under APB No. 18 involves the same uncertainties as described above for long lived assets that we own directly and account for in accordance with SFAS No. 144. However, additional judgment is required by management in order to determine whether a loss in value is "other than temporary." During early 2004, Pepco Holdings announced plans to sell its 50 percent interest in Starpower as part of an ongoing effort to redirect Pepco Holdings investments and to focus on its energy related businesses. At December 31, 2003, Pepco Holdings had an investment in Starpower of $141.8 million. However, because of the distressed telecommunications market and the changed expectations of Starpowers future performance, Pepco Holdings has determined that the fair value of its investment in Starpower at December 31, 2003 is $39.2 million. Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of 2003, Pepco Holdings recorded a noncash charge to its consolidated earnings of $102.6 million ($66.7 million after tax). Derivative Instruments Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in accounting for its derivative instruments represent "Critical Accounting Estimates" because (1) the fair value of the instruments are highly susceptible to changes in market value and interest rate fluctuations, (2) there are significant uncertainties in modeling techniques used to measure fair value in certain circumstances, (3) actual results could vary from those used in Pepco Holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material, and (4) changes in fair values and market prices could result in material impacts to Pepco Holdings assets, liabilities, other comprehensive income (loss), and results of operations. Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments primarily to manage risk associated with commodity prices and interest rates. SFAS No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended, governs the accounting treatment for derivatives and requires that derivative instruments be measured at fair value. The fair value of derivatives is determined using quoted exchange prices where available. For instruments that are not traded on an exchange, external broker quotes are used to determine fair value. For some custom and complex instruments, an internal model is used to interpolate broker quality price information. Models are also used to estimate volumes for certain transactions. The same valuation methods are used to determine the value of non derivative, commodity exposure for risk management purposes. Pension and Other Post retirement Benefit Plans Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in reporting the costs of providing pension and other post retirement benefits represent 58 "Critical Accounting Estimates" because (1) they are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of assumptions which are subjective in nature, (2) they are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience, and (3)changes in assumptions could impact Pepco Holdings expected future cash funding requirements for the plans and would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations, the reported pension and other post retirement benefit liability on the balance sheet, and the reported annual net periodic pension and other post retirement benefit cost on the income statement. In terms of quantifying the anticipated impact of a change in assumptions, Pepco Holdings estimates that a .25% change in the discount rate used to value the benefit obligations could result in a $5 million impact on its consolidated balance sheets and income statements. Additionally, Pepco Holdings estimates that a .25% ch ange in the expected return on plan assets could result in a $3 million impact on the consolidated balance sheets and income statements and a .25% change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate could result in a $.6 million impact on its consolidated balance sheets and income statements. Pepco Holdings management consults with its actuaries and investment consultants when selecting its plan assumptions. Pepco Holdings follows the guidance of SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" (SFAS No. 87), and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Post retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" (SFAS. No. 106), when accounting for these benefits. Under these accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. In accordance with these standards, the impact of changes in these assumptions and the difference between actual and expected or estimated results on pension and post retirement obligations is generally recognized over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans rather than immediately recognized in the income statement. Plan assets are stated at their market value as of the measurement date, December 31. Regulation of Power Delivery Operations The requirements of SFAS No. 71 apply to the Power Delivery businesses of Pepco, DPL, and ACE. Pepco Holdings believes that the judgment involved in accounting for its regulated activities represent "Critical Accounting Estimates" because (1) a significant amount of judgment is required (including but not limited to the interpretation of laws and regulatory commission orders) to assess the probability of the recovery of regulatory assets, (2) actual results and interpretations could vary from those used in Pepco Holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material, and (3) the impact that writing off a regulatory asset would have on Pepco Holdings assets and the net loss related to the charge could be material. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS New Accounting Policies Adopted SFAS No. 143 Pepco Holdings adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 143 entitled "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" (SFAS No. 143) on January 1, 2003. This Statement establishes the accounting and reporting standards for measuring and recording asset retirement obligations. Based on the implementation of SFAS No. 143, at December 31, 2003, $257.9 million in asset removal costs ($181.5 million for DPL and $76.4 59 million for Pepco) and $245.3 million in asset removal costs at December 31, 2002 ($173.2 million for DPL and $72.1 million for Pepco) have been reclassified from accumulated depreciation to a regulatory liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. SFAS No. 150 Effective July 1, 2003 Pepco Holdings implemented SFAS No. 150 entitled "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity" (SFAS No. 150). This Statement established standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its Consolidated Balance Sheet certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The Statement resulted in Pepco Holdings reclassification (initially as of September 30, 2003) of its "Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trust Which Holds Solely Parent Junior Subordinated Debentures" (TOPrS) and "Mandatorily Redeemable Serial Preferred Stock" on its Consolidated Balance Sheet to a long term liability classification. Additionally, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 150, dividends on the TOPrS and Mandatorily Redeemable Serial Preferred Stock, declared subsequent to the July 1, 2003 implement ation of SFAS No. 150, are recorded as interest expense in Pepco Holdings Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2003. In accordance with the transition provisions of SFAS No. 150, prior period amounts were not reclassified on either the consolidated balance sheet or consolidated statement of earnings. In 2003, Potomac Electric Power Company Trust I redeemed all $125 million of its 7.375% Trust Originated Preferred Securities at par. Also during 2003, Atlantic Capital I redeemed all $70 million of its 8.25% Quarterly Income Preferred Securities at par. Effective with the December 31, 2003 implementation of FASB Interpretation No. 46 "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" (FIN 46), Pepco Holdings subsidiaries TOPrS were deconsolidated and therefore not included in its Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2003. Additionally, based on the provisions of FIN 46 Pepco Holdings recorded its investments in its TOPrS trusts and its Debentures issued to the trusts on its Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2003 (these items were previously eliminated in consolidation). For additional information regarding Pepco Holdings implementation of FIN 46 refer to the "FIN 46" implementation section below. Accordingly, Pepco Holdings Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2003 reflects only the reclassification of Pepcos Mandatorily Redeemable Serial Preferred Stock into its long term liability section. In December 2003, the FASB deferred for an indefinite period the application of the guidance in SFAS No. 150 to non controlling interests that are classified as equity in the financial statements of a subsidiary but would be classified as a liability in the parents financial statements under SFAS No. 150. The deferral is limited to mandatorily redeemable non controlling interests associated with finite lived subsidiaries. Pepco Holdings does not have an interest in any such applicable entities as of December 31, 2003, but will continue to evaluate the applicability of this deferral to entities which may be consolidated as a result of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." FIN 45 Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries applied the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" (FIN 45), commencing in 2003 to their agreements that contain guarantee and 60 indemnification clauses. These provisions expand those required by FASB Statement No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," by requiring a guarantor to recognize a liability on its balance sheet for the fair value of obligation it assumes under certain guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002 and to disclose certain types of guarantees, even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantors performance under the guarantee is remote. As of December 31, 2003, Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries did not have material obligations under guarantees or indemnifications issued or modified after December 31, 2002, which are required to be recognized as a liability on its consolidated balance sheets. FIN 46 In January 2003 FIN 46 was issued. FIN 46 was revised and superseded by FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" (FIN 46R) which clarified some of the provisions of FIN 46 and exempted certain entities from its requirements. FIN 46R requires the application of either FIN 46 or FIN 46R by "Public Entities" to all Special Purpose Entities, as defined in FIN 46R (SPEs), created prior to February 1, 2003 at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after December 15, 2003 (Pepco Holdings year end 2003 financial statements). All entities created after January 31, 2003 by Public Entities were already required to be analyzed under FIN 46, and they must continue to do so, unless FIN 46R is adopted early. FIN 46R will be applicable to all non SPEs created prior to February 1, 2003 by public entities that are not small business issuers at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after March 15, 2004 (Pepco Holdings first quarter ended March 31, 2004 financial statements). As a result of the implementation of FIN 46, the following entities were impacted at December 31, 2003: (1) Trust Preferred Securities DPL and ACE have wholly owned financing subsidiary trusts that have common and preferred trust securities outstanding and hold Junior Subordinated Debentures (the Debentures) issued by DPL and ACE. DPL and ACE own all of the common securities of the trusts, which constitute approximately 3% of the liquidation amount of all of the trust securities issued by the trusts. The trusts use interest payments received on the Debentures, which are the trusts only assets, to make cash distributions on the trust securities. The obligations of DPL and ACE pursuant to the Debentures and guarantees of distributions with respect to the trusts securities, to the extent the trusts have funds available therefore, constitute full and unconditional guarantees of the obligations of the trusts under the trust securities the trusts have issued. The preferred trust securities are subject to mandatory redemption upon payment of the Debentures at maturity or upon redem ption. The Debentures mature in 2028 to 2036. The Debentures are subject to redemption, in whole or in part, at the option of DPL or ACE, as applicable, at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued interest. In accordance with the provisions of FIN 46, and as a result of the deconsolidation of the trusts from PHIs financial statements, DPL and ACEs Debentures held by the trusts and DPL and ACEs investments in the trusts are included in PHIs Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2003 and the previously recorded preferred trust securities have been removed from PHIs 61 Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2003. Accordingly, the deconsolidation of the trusts overall does not significantly impact PHIs Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2003. (2) ACE Funding ACE formed ACE Funding during 2001. ACE Funding is a wholly owned subsidiary of ACE. ACE Funding was organized for the sole purpose of purchasing and owning Bondable Transition Property, issuing Transition Bonds to fund the purchasing of Bondable Transition Property, pledging its interest in Bondable Transition Property and other collateral to the trustee for the Transition Bonds to collateralize the Transition Bonds, and to perform activities that are necessary, suitable or convenient to accomplish these purposes. In accordance with the provisions of FIN 46, ACE Funding was assessed and it was determined that it should remain consolidated with Pepco Holdings and ACEs financial statements as of December 31, 2003. Accordingly, the implementation of FIN 46 did not impact Pepco Holdings or ACEs Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2003. (3) Leveraged Leases PCI manages a portfolio of financial investments in leveraged leases. These leveraged lease transactions involve PCIs purchase and leaseback of utility assets, located outside of the United States, that are designed to provide a long term, stable stream of cash flow and earnings. The leases are in separate legally isolated Trusts established to hold the leased assets and the majority of the financing for such transactions has been third party, non recourse debt over the base term. In accordance with the provisions of FIN 46, and as a result of the deconsolidation of the leveraged lease trusts from PHIs financial statements, the underlying leases held by the leveraged lease trusts are excluded and PHIs investments in the trusts are included in PHIs Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2003 using the line item "Investment in Finance Leases Held in Trust." The deconsolidation of the leveraged lease trusts did not significantly impact Pepco Holdings Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2003. (4) Other In accordance with the provisions of FIN 46, two small entities created after January 31, 2003 were required to be consolidated at December 31, 2003 which previously were not consolidated. These entities are not material to Pepco holdings operations and therefore their consolidation did not have a significant impact on Pepco Holdings overall financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, Pepco Holdings has analyzed its interests in entities with which it has power sale agreements and has determined those entities do not qualify as SPE as defined in FIN 46R. The Company will continue to analyze interests in investments and contractual relationships including power sale agreements to determine if such entities should be consolidated or deconsolidated in accordance with FIN 46R. Pepco Holdings is presently unable to determine the effect, if any, on its financial statements of applying FIN 46R to these entities. 62 New Accounting Standards Issued In July 2003, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 11, "Reporting Realized Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments That Are Subject to FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and not Held for Trading Purposes as Defined in EITF Issue No. 02 3 Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF 03 11). This EITF concluded that determining whether realized gains and losses on physically settled derivative contracts not "held for trading purposes" should be reported in the income statement on a gross or net basis is a matter of judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances. Pepco Holdings is in the process of completing its evaluation of the extent of its subsidiaries operating revenue and operating expense reclassifications that may be required. Pepco Hold ings anticipates that the implementation of EITF 03 11, including the associated reclassification of certain operating revenues and operating expenses, will not have an impact on its overall financial position or net results of operations. RISK FACTORS The business and operations of PHI and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the events or conditions identified below. These events or conditions could have an adverse effect on the business of PHI and its subsidiaries, including, depending on the circumstances, their results of operations and financial condition. PHI and its subsidiaries are subject to substantial governmental regulation. If PHI or any of its subsidiaries receives unfavorable regulatory treatment, PHIs business could be negatively affected. PHI is a registered public utility holding company that is subject to regulation by the SEC under PUHCA. As a registered public utility holding company, PHI requires SEC approval to, among other things, issue securities, acquire or dispose of utility assets or securities of utility companies and acquire other businesses. In addition, under PUHCA transactions among PHI and its subsidiaries generally must be performed at cost and subsidiaries are prohibited from paying dividends out of an accumulated deficit or paid in capital without SEC approval. The utility businesses conducted by PHIs power delivery subsidiaries are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local regulatory agencies that significantly affects their operations. Each of Pepco, DPL and ACE is regulated by public service commissions in its service territories, with respect to, among other things, the rates it can charge retail customers for the delivery of electricity. In addition, the rates that the companies can charge for electricity transmission are regulated by the FERC. The companies cannot change delivery or transmission rates without approval by the applicable regulatory authority. While the approved delivery and transmission rates are intended to permit the companies to recover their costs of service and earn a reasonable rate of return, the profitability of the companies is affected by the rates they are able to charge. In addition, if the costs incurred by any of the companies in operatin g its transmission and distribution facilities exceed the allowed amounts for costs included in the approved rates, the financial results of that company, and correspondingly, PHI, will be adversely affected. 63 PHIs subsidiaries also are required to have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from governmental agencies that regulate their businesses. PHI believes that its subsidiaries have obtained the material permits, approvals and certificates necessary for their existing operations and that their businesses are conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, PHI is unable to predict the impact of future regulatory activities of any of these agencies on its business. Changes in or reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations, or the imposition of new laws or regulations, may require PHIs subsidiaries to incur additional expenses or to change the way they conduct their operations. PHIs business could be adversely affected by the Mirant bankruptcy. In 2000, Pepco sold substantially all of its electricity generation assets to Mirant. As part of the sale, Pepco entered into several ongoing contractual arrangements with Mirant and certain of its subsidiaries. On July 14, 2003, Mirant and most of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas. Depending on the outcome of the proceedings, the Mirant bankruptcy could adversely affect PHIs business. See " Relationship with Mirant Corporation." Pepco may be required to make additional divestiture proceeds gain sharing payments to customers in the District of Columbia and Maryland. Pepco currently is involved in regulatory proceedings in Maryland and the District of Columbia related to the sharing of the net proceeds from the sale of its generation related assets. The principal issue in the proceedings is whether Pepco should be required to share with customers the excess deferred income taxes and accumulated deferred investment tax credits associated with the sold assets and, if so, whether such sharing would violate the normalization provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and its implementing regulations. Depending on the outcome of the proceedings, Pepco could be required to make additional gain sharing payments to customers and payments to the IRS in the amount of the associated accumulated deferred investment tax credits, and Pepco might be unable to use accelerated depreciation on District of Columbia and Maryland allocated or assigned property. See "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition an d Results of Operations Regulatory and Other Matters." The operating results of PHIs power delivery and competitive energy subsidiaries fluctuate on a seasonal basis and can be adversely affected by changes in weather. The businesses of PHIs power delivery and competitive energy subsidiaries are seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on their operating performance. Demand for electricity is generally greater in the summer months associated with cooling and demand for electricity and gas is generally greater in the winter months associated with heating as compared to other times of the year. Accordingly, PHIs power delivery and competitive energy subsidiaries historically have generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer. The facilities of PHIs subsidiaries may not operate as planned or may require significant maintenance expenditures, which could decrease their revenues or increase their expenses. 64 Operation of generation, transmission and distribution facilities involves many risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment, accidents, labor disputes and performance below expected levels. Older facilities and equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures for additions or upgrades to keep them operating at peak efficiency, to comply with changing environmental requirements, or to provide reliable operations. Natural disasters and weather related incidents, including tornadoes, hurricanes and snow and ice storms, also can disrupt generation, transmission and distribution delivery systems. Operation of generation, transmission and distribution facilities below expected capacity levels can reduce revenues and result in the incurrence of additional expenses that may not be recoverable from customers or through insurance. Furthermore, if PHIs operatin g subsidiaries are unable to perform their contractual obligations for any of these reasons, they may incur penalties or damages. The transmission facilities of PHIs power delivery subsidiaries are interconnected with the facilities of other transmission facility owners whose actions could have a negative impact on the operations of PHIs subsidiaries. The transmission facilities of Pepco, DPL and ACE are directly interconnected with the transmission facilities of contiguous utilities and as such are part of an interstate power transmission grid. The FERC has designated a number of regional transmission operators to coordinate the operation of portions of the interstate transmission grid. Each of Pepco, DPL and ACE is a member of PJM, which is the regional transmission operator that coordinates the movement of electricity in all or parts of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Pepco, DPL and ACE operate their transmission facilities under the direction and control of PJM. PJM and the other regional transmission operators have established sophisticated systems that are designed to ensure the reliability of the operation of transmission facilities and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impa ct on the operations of the other utilities. However, the systems put in place by PJM and the other regional transmission operators may not always be adequate to prevent problems at other utilities from causing service interruptions in the transmission facilities of Pepco, DPL or ACE. If any of Pepco, DPL or ACE were to suffer such a service interruption, it could have a negative impact on its and PHIs business. The cost of compliance with environmental laws is significant and new environmental laws may increase the expenses of PHI and its subsidiaries. The operations of PHIs subsidiaries, both regulated and unregulated, are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations, relating to air quality, water quality, spill prevention, waste management, natural resources, site remediation, and health and safety. These laws and regulations require PHIs subsidiaries to make capital expenditures and to incur other expenditures to, among other things, meet emissions standards, conduct site remediation and perform environmental monitoring. PHIs subsidiaries also may be required to pay significant remediation costs with respect to third party sites. If PHIs subsidiaries fail to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond their control, such failure could result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities and the need to expend significant sums to come into compliance. 65 In addition, PHIs subsidiaries incur costs to obtain and comply with a variety of environmental permits, licenses, inspections and other approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if PHIs subsidiaries fail to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, operations at affected facilities could be halted or subjected to additional costs. New environmental laws and regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, could impose more stringent limitations on the operations of PHIs subsidiaries or require them to incur significant additional costs. PHIs current compliance strategy may not successfully address the relevant standards and interpretations of the future. PHIs competitive energy business is highly competitive. The unregulated energy generation, supply and marketing businesses in the mid Atlantic region are characterized by intense competition at both the wholesale and retail levels. PHIs competitive energy businesses compete with numerous non utility generators, independent power producers, wholesale power marketers and brokers, and traditional utilities that continue to operate generation assets. This competition generally has the effect of reducing margins and requires a continual focus on controlling costs. PHIs competitive energy businesses rely on some transmission and distribution assets that they do not own or control to deliver wholesale electricity and to obtain fuel for their generation facilities. PHIs competitive energy businesses depend upon transmission facilities owned and operated by others for delivery to customers. The operation of their generation facilities also depends upon coal, natural gas or diesel fuel supplied by others. If electric transmission is disrupted or capacity is inadequate or unavailable, the competitive energy businesses ability to sell and deliver wholesale power, and therefore to fulfill their contractual obligations, could be adversely affected. Similarly, if the fuel supply to one or more of their generation plants is disrupted and storage or other alternative sources of supply are not available the competitive energy businesses ability to operate their generating facilities could be adversely affected. Changes in technology may adversely affect PHIs power delivery and competitive energy businesses. Research and development activities are ongoing to improve alternative technologies to produce electricity, including fuel cells, microturbines and photovoltaic (solar) cells. It is possible that advances in these or other alternative technologies will reduce the costs of electricity production from these technologies, thereby making the generating facilities of PHIs competitive energy businesses less competitive. In addition, increased conservation efforts and advances in technology could reduce demand for electricity supply and distribution, which could adversely affect PHIs power delivery and competitive energy businesses. Changes in technology also could alter the channels through which retail electric customers buy electricity, which could adversely affect PHIs power delivery businesses. PHIs risk management procedures may not prevent losses in the operation of its competitive energy businesses. The operations of PHIs competitive energy businesses are conducted in accordance with sophisticated risk management systems that are designed to 66 quantify risk. However, actual results sometimes deviate from modeled expectations. In particular, risks in PHIs energy activities were measured and monitored utilizing value at risk models to determine the effects of the potential one day favorable or unfavorable price movement. These estimates are based on historical price volatility and assume a normal distribution of price changes. Consequently, if prices significantly deviate from historical prices, PHIs risk management systems, including assumptions supporting risk limits, may not protect PHI from significant losses. In addition, adverse changes in energy prices may result in economic losses in PHIs earnings and cash flows and reductions in the value of assets on its balance sheet under applicable accounting rules. The commodity hedging procedures used by PHIs competitive energy businesses may not protect them from significant losses caused by volatile commodity prices. To lower the financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, PHIs competitive energy businesses routinely enter into contracts to hedge the value of their assets and operations. As part of this strategy, PHIs competitive energy businesses utilize fixed price, forward, physical purchase and sales contracts, tolling agreements, futures, financial swaps and option contracts traded in the over the counter markets or on exchanges. Conectiv Energys goal is to hedge 75% of both the expected power output of its generation facilities and the costs of fuel used to operate those facilities. However, the actual level of hedging coverage may vary from these goals. Due to the high heat rate of the Pepco Energy Services power plant generation, Pepco Energy Services infrequently locks in the forward value of these plants with wholesale contracts. To the extent that PHIs competitive energy businesses have unhedged positions or their h edging procedures do not work as planned, fluctuating commodity prices could result in significant losses. Acts of terrorism could adversely affect PHIs businesses. The threat of or actual acts of terrorism may affect the operations of PHI and its subsidiaries in unpredictable ways and may cause changes in the insurance markets, force PHI and its subsidiaries to increase security measures and cause disruptions of fuel supplies and markets. If any of PHIs infrastructure facilities, such as its electric generation, fuel storage, transmission or distribution facilities, were to be a direct target, or an indirect casualty, of an act of terrorism, its operations could be adversely affected. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism also could affect the ability of PHI and its subsidiaries to raise needed capital. The insurance coverage of PHI and its subsidiaries may not be sufficient to cover all casualty losses that they might incur. PHI and its subsidiaries currently have insurance coverage for their facilities and operations in amounts and with deductibles that they consider appropriate. However, there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, some risks, such as weather related casualties, may not be insurable. In the case of loss or damage to property, plant or equipment, there is no assurance that the insurance proceeds, if any, received will be sufficient to cover the entire cost of replacement or repair. PHI and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected by economic conditions. 67 Periods of slowed economic activity generally result in decreased demand for power, particularly by industrial and large commercial customers. As a consequence, recessions or other downturns in the economy may result in decreased revenues and cash flows for PHIs power delivery and competitive energy businesses. PHI and its subsidiaries are dependent on their ability to successfully access capital markets. An inability to access capital may adversely affect their business. PHI and its subsidiaries rely on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity and to satisfy their capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from their operations. Capital market disruptions, or a downgrade in credit ratings of PHI or its subsidiaries, would increase the cost of borrowing or could adversely affect their ability to access one or more financial markets. Disruptions to the capital markets could include, but are not limited to: recession or an economic slowdown; the bankruptcy of one or more energy companies; significant increases in the prices for oil or other fuel; a terrorist attack or threatened attacks; or a significant transmission failure. PHI may be required to, or may elect to, make significant cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plan. PHI follows the guidance of SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" in accounting for pension benefits under the Retirement Plan, a non contributory defined benefit plan. In accordance with these accounting standards, PHI makes assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. Changes in assumptions such as the use of a different discount rate or expected return on plan assets, affects the calculation of projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit obligation, reported pension liability on PHIs balance sheet, and reported annual net periodic pension benefit cost on PHIs income statement. Furthermore, as a result of actual pension plan experience being different from expected, the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) could be greater than the fair value of pension plan assets. If this were to occur, PHI could be required to recognize an additional minimum liability as prescribed by SFAS No. 87. The liability would be recorded as a reduction to common equity through a charge to Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), and would not affect net income for the year. The charge to OCI would be restored through common equity in future periods when the fair value of plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation. PHIs funding policy is to make cash contributions to the pension plan sufficient for plan assets to exceed the ABO, and avoid the recognition of an additional minimum liability. Use of alternative assumptions could also impact the expected future cash funding requirements for the pension plan if PHIs defined benefit plan did not meet the minimum funding requirements of ERISA. PHIs cash flow, ability to pay dividends and ability to satisfy debt obligations depend on the performance of its operating subsidiaries. PHIs unsecured obligations are effectively subordinated to the liabilities and the outstanding preferred stock of its subsidiaries. 68 PHI is a holding company that conducts its operations entirely through its subsidiaries, and all of PHIs consolidated operating assets are held by its subsidiaries. Accordingly, PHIs cash flow, its ability to satisfy its obligations to creditors and its ability to pay dividends on its common stock are dependent upon the earnings of the subsidiaries and the distribution of such earnings to PHI in the form of dividends. The subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts due on any debt or equity securities issued by PHI or to make any funds available for such payment. Because the claims of the creditors and preferred stockholders of PHIs subsidiaries are superior to PHIs entitlement to dividends, the unsecured debt and obligations of PHI are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of its subsidiaries and to the rights of the holders of preferred stock to receive dividend payments. Energy companies are subject to adverse publicity, which may render PHI and its subsidiaries vulnerable to negative regulatory and litigation outcomes. The energy sector has been among the sectors of the economy that have been the subject of highly publicized allegations of misconduct in recent years. In addition, many utility companies have been publicly criticized for their performance during recent natural disasters and weather related incidents. Adverse publicity of this nature may render legislatures, regulatory authorities, and tribunals less likely to view energy companies such as PHI and its subsidiaries in a favorable light and may cause them to be susceptible to adverse outcomes with respect to decisions by such bodies. Provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and PHIs organizational documents may discourage an acquisition of PHI. PHIs organizational documents and the Delaware General Corporation Law both contain provisions that could impede the removal of PHIs directors and discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire PHI. For example, PHI has a staggered board of directors that is divided into three classes of equal size, with one class elected each year for a term of three years. In addition, as a Delaware corporation, PHI is subject to the business combination law set forth in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could have the effect of delaying, discouraging or preventing an acquisition of PHI.

The results of operations for the year ended 2002, as previously reported by Pepco, include Pepcos operations consolidated with its pre merger subsidiaries operations through July 2002. Accordingly, the results of operations for 2003 and 2002 are not comparable. All amounts in the tables below are in millions. Operating Revenue Results for 2003 Compared to 2002 Total operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $1,548.0 million compared to $1,988.0 million for the corresponding period in 2002. Intercompany revenues have been eliminated for purposes of this analysis. 2003 2002 Change Pepco $1,548.0 $1,533.9 14.1 Pepco Energy Services 401.0 (401.0) PCI 53.1 (53.1) Total $1,548.0 $1,988.0 Delivery revenue increased by $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase results from a $19.2 million increase from a fuel tax pass through, partially offset by $.7 million decrease in Delivery revenue (revenue Pepco receives for delivering energy to its customers). The $.7 million decrease results from a .6% decrease in delivered kilowatt hour sales. SOS revenue (revenue Pepco receives for the procurement of energy by Pepco for its customers) increased by $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 due to colder winter weather as heating degree days increased by 12.2% offset by a 30.2% decrease in cooling degree days. Pepcos retail access to a competitive market for generation services was made available to all Maryland customers on July 1, 2000 and to D.C. customers on January 1, 2001. At December 31, 2003, 14% of Pepcos Maryland customers and 11% of its D.C. customers have chosen alternate suppliers. These customers accounted for 912 megawatts of load in Maryland (of Pepcos total load of 3,439) and 970 megawatts of load in D.C. (of Pepcos total load of 2,269). At December 31, 2002, 16% of Pepcos Maryland customers and 13% of its D.C. customers have chosen alternate suppliers. These customers accounted for 1,175 megawatts of load in Maryland (of Pepcos total load of 3,369) and 1,140 megawatts of load in D.C. (of Pepcos total load of 2,326). 72 Other revenue decreased $8.6 million primarily due to lower capacity (megawatts) available to sell, lower capacity market rates and restructuring in the PJM market. Pepco Energy Services and PCIs operating results during 2003 were not recorded by Pepco because in July 2002 Pepco transferred ownership of Pepco Energy Services and PCI to Pepco Holdings. Results for 2002 Compared to 2001 Total operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $1,988.0 million compared to $2,371.2 million for the corresponding period in 2001. Intercompany revenues have been eliminated for purposes of this analysis. 2002 2001 Change Pepco $1,533.9 $1,723.5 $(189.6) Pepco Energy Services 401.0 541.5 (140.5) PCI 53.1 106.2 (53.1) Total $1,988.0 $2,371.2 The decrease in Pepcos operating revenue during 2002 primarily resulted from a decrease of $206.9 million in standard offer service revenue due to increased customer migration to alternate suppliers during 2002. Retail access to a competitive market for generation services was made available to all Maryland customers on July 1, 2000 and to D.C. customers on January 1, 2001. At December 31, 2002, 16% of Pepcos Maryland customers and 13% of its D.C. customers have chosen alternate suppliers. These customers accounted for 1,175 megawatts of load in Maryland (of Pepcos total load of 3,369) and 1,140 megawatts of load in D.C. (of Pepcos total load of 2,326). The decrease in standard offer service revenue was partially offset by a $26.3 million increase in delivery revenue due to higher delivered kilowatt hour sales from more favorable weather than experienced in 2001. Pepco Energy Services and PCIs operating results during 2002 are only included for seven months (January 2002 through July 2002), compared to a full year during 2001. Operating Expenses Results for 2003 Compared to 2002 Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $1,289.1 million compared to $1,663.1 million for the corresponding period in 2002. Intercompany expenses have been eliminated for purposes of this analysis. 2003 2002 Change Pepco $1,289.1 $1,241.5 47.6 Pepco Energy Services 401.4 (401.4) PCI 20.2 (20.2) Total $1,289.1 $1,663.1 73 The increase in Pepcos operating expense during 2003 primarily results from the recording of a $14.5 million reserve to reflect a potential exposure related to a pre petition receivable from Mirant Corp., for which Pepco filed a creditors claim in the bankruptcy proceedings, plus $15.3 million higher SOS costs. The increase also reflects $11.6 million increase for software amortization, $8.3 million increase in other taxes primarily due to higher fuel taxes partially offset by $2.0 million lower O&M expenses. The decrease in O&M expenses is primarily due to $18.6 million lower severance costs partially offset by $8.4 million higher storm restoration expenses and $9.2 million higher pension and other post retirement benefits. Pepco Energy Services and PCIs operating results during 2003 were not recorded by Pepco because in July 2002 Pepco transferred ownership of Pepco Energy Services and PCI to Pepco Holdings. Results for 2002 Compared to 2001 Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $1,663.1 million compared to $2,004.8 million for the corresponding period in 2001. Intercompany expenses have been eliminated for purposes of this analysis. 2002 2001 Change Pepco $1,241.5 $1,334.4 $(92.9) Pepco Energy Services 401.4 524.1 (122.7) PCI 20.2 146.3 (126.1) Total $1,663.1 $2,004.8 The decrease in Utility operating expense during 2002 results from a $179.7 million decrease in fuel and purchased energy expense due to less energy purchased due to higher customer migration. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $31.2 million in O&M expenses due to an increase in severance costs recorded compared to the corresponding period last year; an increase of $8.5 million in depreciation expense; and an increase of $11.8 million in other taxes due to higher Maryland property taxes and higher delivery taxes and Pennsylvania property taxes. In addition, 2001 included a net gain of $29.3 million that resulted from the sale in January 2001 of Pepcos interest in the Conemaugh generating station. Pepco Energy Services and PCIs operating results during 2002 are only included for seven months (January 2002 through July 2002), compared to a full year during 2001. Other Income (Expenses) Results for 2003 Compared to 2002 Total other income (expenses) for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $(80.6) million compared to $(96.3) million for the corresponding period in 2002. 2003 2002 Change Pepco $(80.6) $(77.5) $(3.1) Pepco Energy Services 1.0 (1.0) PCI (19.8) 19.8 Total $(80.6) $(96.3) 74 The increase in Pepcos other (expenses) during 2003 resulted from $4.6 million in distributions on mandatorily redeemable preferred securities that in accordance with SFAS No. 150 were reclassified to interest expense commencing in the third quarter of 2003. This reclass was not required for 2002. This increase was partially offset by a D.C. street lighting contract that Pepco had in 2002 but not in 2003. Pepco Energy Services and PCIs operating results during 2003 were not recorded by Pepco because in July 2002 Pepco transferred ownership of Pepco Energy Services and PCI to Pepco Holdings. Results for 2002 Compared to 2001 Total other income (expenses) for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $(96.3) million compared to $(105.3) million for the corresponding period in 2001. 2002 2001 Change Pepco $(77.5) $ (48.8) $(28.7) Pepco Energy Services 1.0 1.4 (.4) PCI (19.8) (57.9) 38.1 Total $(96.3) $(105.3) The increase in Utility other (expenses) during 2002 primarily results from a $37.1 million decrease in interest income primarily due to lower proceeds remaining to invest from Pepcos generation asset divestitures and due to a $13.4 million decrease in other income. These variances were partially offset by a decrease of $21.8 million in interest expense as a result of lower interest expense incurred on commercial paper and other debt outstanding due to the payoff of debt. Pepco Energy Services and PCIs operating results during 2002 are only included for seven months (January 2002 through July 2002), compared to a full year during 2001. Income Tax Expense Results for 2003 Compared to 2002 Total income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $69.1 million compared to $80.3 million for the corresponding period in 2002. 2003 2002 Change Pepco $69.1 $81.7 $(12.6) Pepco Energy Services .4 (.4) PCI (1.8) 1.8 Total $69.1 $80.3 Pepcos effective tax rate in 2003 was 40% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference are state income taxes (net of federal benefit) and the flow through of certain book tax depreciation differences. In 2002, the effective rate was 37% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference are state income taxes (net of federal benefit) and the flow through of certain book tax depreciation differences partially offset by the inclusion of the tax benefits of Pepcos pre merger subsidiaries through July 2002. 75 Pepco Energy Services and PCIs operating results during 2003 were not recorded by Pepco because in July 2002 Pepco transferred ownership of Pepco Energy Services and PCI to Pepco Holdings. Results for 2002 Compared to 2001 Total income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $80.3 million compared to $83.5 million for the corresponding period in 2001. 2002 2001 Change Pepco $81.7 $130.9 $(49.2) Pepco Energy Services .4 8.5 (8.1) PCI (1.8) (55.9) 54.1 Total $80.3 $83.5 The decrease in Utility income tax expense during 2002 results from lower taxes as a result of lower interest income and due to the fact that 2001 included taxes incurred on Pepcos generating plant divestitures. Pepco Energy Services and PCIs operating results during 2002 are only included for seven months (January 2002 through July 2002), compared to a full year during 2001. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY General Financing Activities Pepco issued $200 million of secured senior notes that mature in 2013. Proceeds of approximately $198 million were used to refinance previously issued higher interest trust preferred securities of $125 million and to repay short term debt of $73 million. Working Capital At December 31, 2003, Pepcos current assets totaled $347.5 million, whereas current liabilities totaled $432.0 million. Current liabilities include $107.5 million of short term debt. Cash Flow Activity During 2003, $325.9 million in cash was provided from operating activities, $197.5 million in cash was used by investing activities, and $139.8 million of cash was used by financing activities, resulting in an decrease of $11.4 million in cash and cash equivalents during the year to $6.8 million. At December 31, 2002, cash and cash equivalents were $18.2 million. Capital Requirements Construction Expenditures Pepcos construction expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $203 million. For the five year period 2004 through 2008, Pepcos total construction expenditures are projected to be approximately $1.0 billion. 76 Dividends Under PUHCA, PHI is prohibited, without SEC approval, from paying dividends on its common stock from capital or unearned surplus. PHI generates no operating income of its own. Accordingly, its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders depends on dividends received from its subsidiaries. Pepcos articles of incorporation contain provisions restricting the amount of dividends that can be paid on common stock when preferred stock is outstanding if the applicable companys capitalization ratio is less than 25%. For this purpose, the capitalization ratio is equal to (i) common stock capital plus surplus, divided by (ii) total capital (including long term debt) plus surplus. Pension Funding Pepco Holdings has a noncontributory retirement plan (the Retirement Plan) that covers substantially all employees of Pepco, DPL, ACE and certain employees of other Pepco Holdings subsidiaries. Following the consummation of the acquisition of Conectiv by Pepco on August 1, 2002, the Pepco General Retirement Plan and the Conectiv Retirement Plan were merged into the Retirement Plan on December 31, 2002. The provisions and benefits of the merged Retirement Plan applicable to Pepco employees are identical to those in the original Pepco plan and the provisions and benefits applicable to DPL and ACE employees are identical to those in the original Conectiv plan. As of the 2003 valuation, the Retirement Plan satisfied the minimum funding requirements of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) without any additional funding. However, PHIs funding policy with regard to the Retirement Plan is to maintain a funding level in excess of 100% of its accrued benefit obligation. In 2003 and 2002, PHI made discretionary tax deductible cash contributions to the Retirement Plan in accordance with its funding policy. In 2003, the accumulated benefit obligation for the Retirement Plan increased over 2002, primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to value the accumulated benefit obligation, which reflected the declining interest rate environment in 2003. However, the financial markets experienced a recovery during 2003, and the Retirement Plan assets achieved returns in excess of the levels assumed in the valuation. As a result of the combination of these factors, in October 2003 PHI contributed a total of $50 million (of which $30 million was funded by Pepco and $20 million funded by ACE) to the Retirement Plan. The contribution was made to ensure that under reasonable assumptions, the funding level at year end would be in excess of 100% of the accrued benefit obligation. In 2002, PHI contributed a total of $35 million (all of which was funded by Pepco) to the Retirement Plan. PHI currently estimates that no contributions will be required i n 2004 to maintain a funding level in excess of 100% of the accumulated benefit obligation. Contractual Obligations And Commercial Commitments Summary information about Pepcos consolidated contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2003, is as follows: 77 Contractual Maturity Obligation Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years (Dollars in Millions) Short term debt $ 107.5 $ 107.5 $ $ $ Long term debt 1,130.4 100.0 338.0 692.4 Preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption 45.0 2.5 5.0 37.5 Capital and operating leases 130.3 15.6 33.3 33.3 48.1 Total $1,413.2 $ 125.6 $ 138.3 $ 408.8 $ 740.5 Sources Of Capital Pepcos sources to meet its long term funding needs, such as capital expenditures, and its short term funding needs, such as working capital and the temporary funding of long term funding needs, include internally generated funds, securities issuances and bank financing under new or existing facilities. Pepcos ability to generate funds from its operations and to access capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties. See "Risk Factors" for a discussion of important factors that may impact these sources of capital. Short Term Funding Sources Pepco has traditionally used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs, such as commercial paper, short term notes and bank lines of credit. Proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs but may also be used to temporarily fund long term capital requirements. Pepco maintains an ongoing commercial paper program of up to $300 million. The commercial paper notes can be issued with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issue. In July 2003, Pepco Holdings, Pepco, DPL and ACE entered into (i) a three year working capital credit facility with an aggregate credit limit of $550 million and (ii) a 364 day working capital credit facility with an aggregate credit limit of $550 million. Pepco Holdings credit limit under these facilities is $700 million, and the credit limit of each of Pepco, DPL and ACE under these facilities is the lower of $300 million and the maximum amount of short term debt authorized by the appropriate state commission, except that the aggregate amount of credit utilized by Pepco, DPL and ACE at any given time under these facilities may not exceed $400 million. Funds borrowed under these facilities are available for general corporate purposes. Either credit facility also can be used as credit support for the commercial paper programs of the respective companies. The three year and 364 day credit agreements contain customary financial and other cove nants that, if not satisfied, could result in the acceleration of repayment obligations under the agreements or restrict the ability of the companies to borrow under the agreements. Among these covenants is the requirement that each borrowing company maintain a ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization of 65% or less, computed in accordance with the terms of the credit agreements. As of December 31, 2003, the applicable ratios for Pepco Holdings, Pepco, DPL and ACE were 60.0%. 55.0%, 48.4% and 47.9%, respectively. The credit agreements also contain a number of customary events of default that could result in the acceleration of repayment obligations under the agreements, including (i) the failure of any borrowing company or any of its significant 78 subsidiaries to pay when due, or the acceleration of, certain indebtedness under other borrowing arrangements, (ii) certain bankruptcy events, judgments or decrees against any borrowing company or its significant subsidiaries, and (iii) a change in control (as defined in the credit agreements) of Pepco Holdings or the failure of Pepco Holdings to own all of the voting stock of Pepco, DPL and ACE. Long Term Funding Sources The sources of long term funding for Pepco are the issuance of debt and equity securities and borrowing under long term credit agreements. Proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements, such as capital expenditures and new investments, and to refund or refinance existing securities. PUHCA Restrictions An SEC Financing Order dated July 31, 2002 (the "Financing Order"), requires that, in order to issue debt or equity securities, including commercial paper, Pepco must maintain a ratio of common stock equity to total capitalization (consisting of common stock, preferred stock, if any, long term debt and short term debt) of at least 30 percent. At December 31, 2003, Pepcos common equity ratio was 43.4 percent. The Financing Order also requires that all rated securities issued by Pepco be rated "investment grade" by at least one nationally recognized rating agency. Accordingly, if Pepcos common equity ratio were less than 30 percent or if no nationally recognized rating agency rated a security investment grade, Pepco could not issue the security without first obtaining from the SEC an amendment to the Financing Order. If an amendment to the Financing Order is required to enable Pepco to effect a financing, there is no certainty that such an amendment could be obtained, as to the terms and conditions on which an amendment could be obtained or as to the timing of SEC action. The failure to obtain timely relief from the SEC, in such circumstances, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of Pepco. Other Liquidity Considerations For a discussion of the potential impact of the Mirant bankruptcy on liquidity, see "Relationship with Mirant Corporation" section that follows. REGULATORY AND OTHER MATTERS Relationship with Mirant Corporation In 2000, Pepco sold substantially all of its electricity generation assets to Mirant Corporation, formerly Southern Energy, Inc. As part of the sale, Pepco entered into several ongoing contractual arrangements with Mirant and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, Mirant). On July 14, 2003, Mirant Corporation and most of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas (the Bankruptcy Court). Under bankruptcy law, a debtor generally may, with authorization from a bankruptcy court, assume or reject executory contracts. A rejection of an executory contract entitles the counterparty to file a claim as an unsecured creditor against the bankruptcy estate for damages incurred due to the 79 rejection of the contract. In a bankruptcy proceeding, a debtor can normally restructure some or all of its pre petition liabilities. Depending on the outcome of the matters discussed below, the Mirant bankruptcy could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of Pepco. However, management currently believes that Pepco currently have sufficient cash, cash flow and borrowing capacity under their credit facilities and in the capital markets to be able to satisfy the additional cash requirements that are expected to arise due to the Mirant bankruptcy. Accordingly, management does not anticipate that the Mirant bankruptcy will impair the ability of Pepco to fulfill their contractual obligations or to fund projected capital expenditures. On this basis, management currently does not believe that the Mirant bankruptcy will have a material adverse effect on Pepcos financial condition. Transition Power Agreements As part of the asset purchase and sale agreement for the Pepco generation assets (the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement), Pepco and Mirant entered into Transition Power Agreements for Maryland and the District of Columbia, respectively (collectively, the TPAs). Under these agreements, Mirant was obligated to supply Pepco with all of the capacity and energy needed to fulfill its standard offer service obligations in Maryland through June 2004 and its standard offer service obligations in the District of Columbia into January 2005, in each case at rates that were lower than the rates that Pepco charges to its customers. The original rates under the TPAs were less than the prevailing market rates. At the time Mirant filed for bankruptcy, the purchase prices for energy and capacity under the TPAs were below the prevailing market rates. To avoid the potential rejection of the TPAs Pepco and Mirant Corporation and its affiliate Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, LP (the Mirant Parties) entered into a settlement agreement, which was approved by the Bankruptcy Court on November 19, 2003 (the Settlement Agreement). Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Mirant Parties have assumed both of the TPAs and the TPAs have been amended, effective October 1, 2003, to increase the purchase price of energy thereunder as described below. The Settlement Agreement also provides that Pepco has an allowed, pre petition general unsecured claim against each of the Mirant Parties in the amount of $105 million (the Pepco TPA Claim), and has the right to assert the Pepco TPA Claim against other Mirant debtors. On December 15, 2003, Pepco filed Proofs of Claim in the amount of $105 million against the appropriate Mirant debtors. In accordance with the Settlement Agreement, the purchase price of energy under the TPAs has increased from $35.50 to $41.90 per megawatt hour during summer months (May 1 through September 30) and from $25.30 to $31.70 per megawatt hour during winter months (October 1 through April 30) under the District of Columbia TPA and has increased from $40.00 to $46.40 per megawatt hour during summer months and from $22.20 to $28.60 per megawatt hour during winter months under the Maryland TPA. Under the amended TPAs, the purchase prices paid by Pepco for capacity in the District of Columbia and Maryland remain $3.50 per megawatt hour and the charge paid by Pepco for certain ancillary services remain $.50 per megawatt hour. The amendments to the TPAs have resulted in an increase in the average purchase price to Pepco for energy from approximately 3.4 cents per kilowatt hour under the original terms of the TPAs to an average purchase price of approximatel y 4.0 cents per kilowatt hour. The revenues produced by the currently approved tariff rates 80 that Pepco charges its customers for providing standard offer service average approximately 4.1 cents per kilowatt hour. Pepco estimates that, as a result of the price increases, it will pay Mirant an additional $105 million for the purchase of energy beginning October 1, 2003 through the remaining terms of the TPAs. These payments will be offset by a reduction of payments by Pepco to customers for the period 2003 through 2006 of approximately $45 million pursuant to the generation procurement credit established pursuant to regulatory settlements entered into in the District of Columbia and Maryland under which Pepco and its customers share any margin between the price paid by Pepco to procure standard offer service and the price paid by customers for standard offer service. As a result, Pepco currently anticipates that it will incur a net additional cash outlay of approximately $60 million due to the amendments of the respective TPAs. The foregoing estimates are based on current service territory load served by competitive suppliers and by standard offer se rvice and does not include financing costs, all of which could be subject to fluctuation. The amount, if any, that Pepco will be able to recover from the Mirant bankruptcy estate in respect of the Pepco TPA Claim will depend on the amount of assets available for distribution to creditors. At the current stage of the bankruptcy proceeding, there is insufficient information to determine the amount, if any, that Pepco might be able to recover from the Mirant bankruptcy estate. No receivable has been recorded in Pepcos accounting records in respect of the Pepco TPA Claim. Any recovery would be shared with customers pursuant to the generation procurement credit. Power Purchase Agreements Under agreements with FirstEnergy Corp., formerly Ohio Edison (FirstEnergy), and Allegheny Energy, Inc., both entered into in 1987, Pepco is obligated to purchase from FirstEnergy 450 megawatts of capacity and energy annually through December 2005 (the FirstEnergy PPA). Under an agreement with Panda, entered into in 1991, Pepco is obligated to purchase from Panda 230 megawatts of capacity and energy annually through 2021 (the Panda PPA). In each case, the purchase price is substantially in excess of current market prices. As a part of the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, Pepco entered into a "back to back" arrangement with Mirant. Under this arrangement, Mirant is obligated, among other things, to purchase from Pepco the capacity and energy that Pepco is obligated to purchase under the FirstEnergy PPA and the Panda PPA at a price equal to the price Pepco is obligated to pay under the PPAs (the PPA Related Obligations). Pepco Pre Petition Claims When Mirant filed its bankruptcy petition on July 14, 2003, Mirant had unpaid obligations to Pepco of approximately $29 million, consisting primarily of payments due to Pepco in respect of the PPA Related Obligations (the Mirant Pre Petition Obligations). The Mirant Pre Petition Obligations constitute part of the indebtedness for which Mirant is seeking relief in its bankruptcy proceeding. Pepco has filed Proofs of Claim in the Mirant bankruptcy proceeding in the amount of approximately $26 million to recover this indebtedness; however, the amount of Pepcos recovery, if any, is uncertain. The $3 million difference between Mirants unpaid obligation to Pepco and the $26 million Proofs of Claim filed by Pepco primarily represents a TPA settlement adjustment which is included in the $105 million Proofs of Claim filed by Pepco on December 15, 2003 against the Mirant debtors. In view of this uncertainty, Pepco, in the third quarter of 2003 , expensed $14.5 81 million ($8.7 million after tax) to establish a reserve against the $29 million receivable from Mirant. The amount expensed represents Pepcos estimate of the possible outcome in bankruptcy, although the amount ultimately recoverable could be higher or lower. Mirants Attempt to Reject the PPA Related Obligations On August 28, 2003, Mirant filed with the Bankruptcy Court a motion seeking authorization to reject its PPA Related Obligations. Mirants motion also sought injunctions to prohibit Pepco from initiating, or encouraging any person or entity to initiate, any proceedings before the FERC that seek to require Mirant to perform the PPA Related Obligations and to prohibit FERC from taking any action to require Mirant to perform the PPA Related Obligations. On September 25, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order stating that it was not necessary to issue an injunction against Pepco because the automatic stay provisions of the Bankruptcy Code prohibit Pepco from commencing or continuing any judicial or administrative proceedings against Mirant. The Bankruptcy Courts order did grant a preliminary injunction that prohibits FERC from (i) taking any action to require or coerce Mirant to abide by the terms of the PPA Related Obligations or commencing or continuing any proceeding outside of the Bankruptcy Court with respect to the PPA Related Obligations and (ii) taking any action, or encouraging any person or entity to take an action, to require or coerce Mirant to abide by the terms of the TPAs. The Bankruptcy Court also ordered Mirant to continue to perform the PPA Related Obligations and its obligations under the TPAs until relieved of those obligations by an order of an appropriate court. Upon motions filed by Pepco and FERC, on October 9, 2003, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas (the District Court) withdrew jurisdiction over both the rejection and preliminary injunction proceedings from the Bankruptcy Court. On December 23, 2003, the District Court denied Mirants motion to reject the PPA Related Obligations. On January 5, 2004 Mirant filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (the Circuit Court) a notice of appeal of the District Courts December 23 decision. On January 6, 2004, The Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Mirant Corporation (the Creditors Committee) filed with the Circuit Court a separate notice of appeal of the December 23 decision. Also on January 6, 2004, the District Court entered an order dissolving all injunctive relief granted by the Bankruptcy Court in respect of the PPA Related Obligations, and Mirant and the Creditors Committee each subsequently filed a motion with the Circuit Court for a stay of the dissolution order pending resolution of the appeals, as well as motions to expedite the appeals. On January 23, 2004, the Circuit Court denied Mirants and the Creditors Committees motions to expedite the appeal. On January 26, 2004, the Circuit Court denied Mirants and the Creditors Committees motions to stay the District Courts Order. Oral argument will be scheduled the week of May 3, 2004. Pepco is exercising all available legal remedies and vigorously opposing Mirants continued attempts to reject the PPA Related Obligations in order to protect the interests of its customers and shareholders. While Pepco believes that it has substantial legal bases to oppose the attempt to reject the agreements, the outcome of Mirants efforts to reject the PPA Related Obligations is uncertain. In accordance with the Bankruptcy Courts September 25 order, Mirant is continuing to perform the PPA Related Obligations pending the resolution of 82 the ongoing proceedings. However, if Mirant ultimately is successful in rejecting, and is otherwise permitted to stop performing the PPA Related Obligations, Pepco could be required to repay to Mirant, for the period beginning on the effective date of the rejection (which date could be prior to the date of the courts order and possibly as early as September 18, 2003) and ending on the date Mirant is entitled to cease its purchases of energy and capacity from Pepco, all amounts paid by Mirant to Pepco in respect of the PPA Related Obligations, less an amount equal to the price at which Mirant resold the purchased energy and capacity. Pepco estimates that the amount it could be required to repay to Mirant in the unlikely event September 18, 2003, is determined to be the effective date of rejection, as of March 1, 2004, is approximately $51.4 million. This repayment would entitle Pepco to file a claim against the bankruptcy estate in an amount equal to the amount repaid. Mirant has also asked the Bankruptcy Court to require Pepco to disgorge all amounts paid by Mirant to Pepco in respect of the PPA Related Obligations, less an amount equal to the price at which Mirant resold the purchased energy and capacity, for the period July 14, 2003 (the date on which Mirant filed its bankruptcy petition) to September 18, 2003, on the theory that Mirant did not receive value for those payments. Pepco estimates that the amount it would be required to repay to Mirant on the disgorgement theory is approximately $22.8 million. Pepco believes a claim based on this theory should be entitled to administrative expense status for which complete recovery could be expected. If Pepco were required to repay any such amounts for either period, the payment would be expensed at the time the payment is made. The following are estimates prepared by Pepco of its additional exposure if Mirants motion to reject its PPA Related Obligations ultimately is successful. These estimates are based in part on current market prices and forward price estimates for energy and capacity, and do not include financing costs, all of which could be subject to significant fluctuation. The estimates assume no recovery from the Mirant bankruptcy estate and no regulatory recovery, either of which would mitigate the effect of the estimated loss. Pepco does not consider it realistic to assume that there will be no such recoveries. Based on these assumptions, Pepco estimates that its pre tax exposure as of March 1, 2004, representing the loss of the future benefit of the PPA Related Obligations to Pepco, is as follows: If Pepco were required to purchase capacity and energy from FirstEnergy commencing as of March 1, 2004, at the rates provided in the PPA (with an average price per kilowatt hour of approximately 6.1 cents) and resold the capacity and energy at market rates projected, given the characteristics of the FirstEnergy PPA, to be approximately 4.5 cents per kilowatt hour, Pepco estimates that it would cost approximately $50 million for the remainder of 2004, and $56 million in 2005, the last year of the FirstEnergy PPA. If Pepco were required to purchase capacity and energy from Panda commencing as of March 1, 2004, at the rates provided in the PPA (with an average price per kilowatt hour of approximately 15.6 cents), and resold the capacity and energy at market rates projected, given the characteristics of the Panda PPA, to be approximately 6.9 cents per kilowatt hour, Pepco estimates that it would cost approximately $33 million for the remainder of 2004, $38 million in 2005, and $36 million in 2006 and approximately $35 million to $43 million annually thereafter through the 2021 contract termination date. The ability of Pepco to recover from the Mirant bankruptcy estate in respect of the Mirant Pre Petition Obligations and damages if the PPA Related 83 Obligations are successfully rejected will depend on whether Pepcos claims are allowed, the amount of assets available for distribution to creditors and Pepcos priority relative to other creditors. At the current stage of the bankruptcy proceeding, there is insufficient information to determine the amount, if any, that Pepco might be able to recover from the Mirant bankruptcy estate, whether the recovery would be in cash or another form of payment, or the timing of any recovery. If Mirant ultimately is successful in rejecting the PPA Related Obligations and Pepcos full claim is not recovered from the Mirant bankruptcy estate, Pepco may seek authority from the MPSC and the DCPSC to recover its additional costs. Pepco is committed to working with its regulatory authorities to achieve a result that is appropriate for its shareholders and customers. Under the provisions of the settlement agreements approved by the MPSC and the DCPSC in the deregulation proceedings in which Pepco agreed to divest its generation assets under certain conditions, the PPAs were to become assets of Pepcos distribution business if they could not be sold. Pepco believes that, if Mirant ultimately is successful in rejecting the PPA Related Obligations, these provisions would allow the stranded costs of the PPAs that are not recovered from the Mirant bankruptcy estate to be recovered through Pepcos distribution rates. If Pepcos interpretation o f the settlement agreements is confirmed, Pepco expects to be able to establish the amount of its anticipated recovery as a regulatory asset. However, there is no assurance that Pepcos interpretation of the settlement agreements would be confirmed by the respective public service commissions. If the PPA Related Obligations are successfully rejected, and there is no regulatory recovery, Pepco will incur a loss. However, the accounting treatment of such a loss depends on a number of legal and regulatory factors, and is not determinable at this time. The SMECO Agreement As a term of the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, Pepco assigned to Mirant a facility and capacity agreement with Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative, Inc. (SMECO) under which Pepco was obligated to purchase the capacity of an 84 megawatt combustion turbine installed and owned by SMECO at a former Pepco generating station (the SMECO Agreement). The agreement contemplates a monthly payment to SMECO of approximately $.5 million. Pepco is responsible to SMECO for the performance of the SMECO Agreement if Mirant fails to perform its obligations thereunder. At this time, Mirant continues to make post petition payments due to SMECO. Regulatory Matters Divestiture Cases Final briefs on Pepcos District of Columbia divestiture proceeds sharing application were filed on July 31, 2002 following an evidentiary hearing in June 2002. That application was filed to implement a provision of Pepcos DCPSC approved divestiture settlement that provided for a sharing of any net proceeds from the sale of Pepcos generation related assets. One of the principal issues in the case is whether Pepco should be required to share with customers, on an approximately 50/50 basis, the excess deferred income taxes (EDIT) and accumulated deferred investment tax credits (ADITC) associated with the sold assets and, if so, whether such sharing would violate the normalization provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and its implementing regulations. As of December 31, 2003, the District of Columbia allocated portions of EDIT and ADITC associated with the divested generation 84 assets were, respectively, approximately $6.5 million and $5.8 million, respectively. Other issues in the proceeding deal with the treatment of internal costs and cost allocations as deductions from the gross proceeds of the divestiture. Pepco believes that a sharing of EDIT and ADITC would violate the normalization rules. If Pepco were required to share EDIT and ADITC and, as a result, the normalization rules were violated, Pepco would be unable to use accelerated depreciation on District of Columbia allocated or assigned property. Pepco, in addition to sharing with customers an amount equal to approximately 50% of the generation related ADITC balance, would have to pay to the IRS an amount equal to Pepcos $5.8 million District of Columbia jurisdictional generation related ADITC balance as well as its District of Columbia jurisdictional transmission and distribution related ADITC balance as of the later of the date a DCPSC order is issued and all rights to appeal have been exhausted or lapsed, or the date the DCPSC order becomes operative. As of December 31, 2003, the District of Columbia jurisdictional transmission and distribution related ADITC balance was approxima tely $8 million. Pepco believes that its calculation of the District of Columbia customers share of divestiture proceeds is correct. However, depending on the ultimate outcome of this proceeding, Pepco could be required to make additional gain sharing payments to D.C. customers, including the payments described above related to EDIT and ADITC. Such additional payments (which, other than the EDIT and ADITC related payments, cannot be estimated) would be charged to expense in the quarter and year in which a final decision is rendered and could have a material adverse effect on Pepcos and PHIs results of operations for those periods. However, neither PHI nor Pepco believes that additional gain sharing payments, if any, or the ADITC related payments to the IRS, if required, would have a material adverse impact on its financial condition. It is uncertain when the DCPSC will issue a decision. Pepco filed its divestiture proceeds plan application in Maryland in April 2001. Reply briefs were filed in May 2002. The principal issue in the Maryland case is the same EDIT and ADITC sharing issue that was raised in the D.C. case. As of December 31, 2003, the Maryland allocated portions of EDIT and ADITC associated with the divested generation assets were approximately $9.1 million and $10.4 million, respectively. Other issues deal with the treatment of certain costs as deductions from the gross proceeds of the divestiture. On November 21, 2003, the Hearing Examiner in the Maryland proceeding issued a proposed order that concluded that Pepcos Maryland divestiture settlement agreement provided for a sharing between Pepco and customers of the EDIT and ADITC associated with the sold assets. Pepco believes that such a sharing would violate the normalization rules and would result in Pepcos inability to use accelerated depreciation on Mary land allocated or assigned property. If the proposed order is affirmed, Pepco would have to share with its Maryland customers, on an approximately 50/50 basis, the Maryland allocated portion of the generation related EDIT, i.e., $9.1 million, and the generation related ADITC. If such sharing were to violate the normalization rules, Pepco, in addition to sharing with customers an amount equal to approximately 50% of the generation related ADITC balance, would be unable to use accelerated depreciation on Maryland allocated or assigned property. Furthermore, Pepco would have to pay to the IRS an amount equal to Pepcos $10.4 million Maryland jurisdictional generation related ADITC balance, as well as its Maryland retail jurisdictional ADITC transmission and distribution related balance as of the later of the date a MPSC order is issued and all rights to appeal have been exhausted or lapsed, or the date the MPSC order becomes operative. As of December 31, 2003, the Maryland retail jurisdictional t ransmission and distribution related ADITC 85 balance was approximately $12 million. The Hearing Examiner decided all other issues in favor of Pepco, except that only one half of the severance payments that Pepco included in its calculation of corporate reorganization costs should be deducted from the sales proceeds before sharing of the net gain between Pepco and customers. Under Maryland law, if the proposed order is appealed to the MPSC, the proposed order is not a final, binding order of the MPSC and further action by the MPSC is required with respect to this matter. Pepco has appealed the Hearing Examiners decision on the treatment of EDIT and ADITC and corporate reorganization costs to the MPSC. Pepco cannot predict what the outcome of the appeal will be or when the appeal might be decided. Pepco believes that its calculation of the Maryland customers share of divestiture proceeds is correct. However, depending on the ultimate outcome of this proceeding, Pepco could be required to share with its customers approximately 50% of the EDIT and ADITC balances described above and make additional gain sharing payments related to the disallowed severance payments. Such additional payments would be charged to expense in the quarter and year in which a final decision is rendered and could have a material adverse e ffect on results of operations for those periods. However, neither PHI nor Pepco believes that additional gain sharing payments, if any, or the ADITC related payments to the IRS, if required, would have a material adverse impact on its financial condition. Standard Offer Service (SOS) District of Columbia On February 21, 2003, the DCPSC opened a new proceeding to consider issues relating to (a) the establishment of terms and conditions for providing SOS in the District of Columbia after Pepcos obligation to provide SOS terminates on February 7, 2005, and (b) the selecting of a new SOS provider. Under current District of Columbia law, if the DCPSC selects a retail SOS provider (i.e., some entity or entities other than Pepco) to provide SOS after February 7, 2005, it must make the selection(s) before July 2, 2004; however, if the DCPSC decides to have Pepco continue as the SOS provider after February 7, 2005, it need not complete the procurement process before July 2, 2004. The law also allows the selection of Pepco as the SOS provider in the event of insufficient or inadequate bids from potential SOS providers other than Pepco. On December 31, 2003, the DCPSC issued an order which sets forth the terms and conditions for the selection of a new SOS provider(s) and the provision of SOS by Pepco on a contingency basis. On December 31, 2003, the DCPSC also issued an order adopting terms and conditions that would apply if Pepco continues as the SOS provider after February 7, 2005. On January 9, 2004, the DCPSC issued an order in which it requested initial and reply comments by January 29, 2004, and February 9, 2004, respectively, on which SOS model (i.e., the wholesale SOS model, under which Pepco would continue as the SOS provider after February 7, 2005, or the retail model, under which some entity or entities other than Pepco would be the SOS provider after February 7, 2005) would best meet the needs of the DC SOS customers after February 7, 2005. Pepco and most of the other parties in the case filed applications for reconsideration and or clarification of various parts of the two DCPSC orders that set forth the terms and conditions that would apply under the retail and wholesale SOS models. Pepco and most parties also filed initial and reply 86 comments on which SOS model would best serve the needs of the SOS customers in DC. In its comments, Pepco supported the wholesale SOS model. On March 1, 2004, the DCPSC issued an order adopting the wholesale SOS model, i.e., Pepco will continue to be the SOS provider in the District of Columbia after February 7, 2005. The DCPSC also granted in part and denied in part the applications for reconsideration and or clarification of the order adopting the terms and conditions applicable to the wholesale model. Finally, the DCPSC denied as moot the applications for reconsideration and or clarification of the order adopting the terms and conditions applicable to the retail SOS model because the DCPSC adopted the wholesale SOS model. Parties have until March 31, 2004 to apply for reconsideration of the order adopting the wholesale model. Generally, parties have until April 30, 2004 to seek judicial review of the order denying reconsideration of the order that adopted the terms and conditions applicable to the retail SOS model and the order granting in part and denying in part the order adopting the terms and conditions applicable to the wholesale SOS model. Maryland In April 2003, the MPSC approved a settlement to extend the provision of SOS in Maryland. Under the settlement, Pepco will continue to provide SOS supply to customers at market prices after the existing fixed SOS supply rate expires in July 2004 for periods of four years for residential and small commercial customers, two years for medium sized commercial customers and one year for large commercial customers. In accordance with the settlement, Pepco will purchase the power supply required to satisfy its market rate SOS supply obligation from one or more wholesale suppliers under contracts entered into pursuant to a competitive bid procedure approved by the MPSC. The settlement provides for Pepco to recover from its SOS customers the costs associated with the acquisition of the SOS supply as well as an average margin of $0.002 per kilowatt hour. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES General The SEC has defined a companys most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations, and which require it to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates represent those estimates and assumptions that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and that have a material impact on financial condition or operating performance. Accounting Policy Choices Pepcos management believes that based on the nature of the business in which it operates, it has very little choice regarding the accounting policies it utilizes. For instance, its operations are subject to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71 "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71). SFAS No. 71 allows regulated entities, in appropriate circumstances, to establish regulatory assets and liabilities and to defer the income statement impact of certain costs that are expected to be recovered in future rates. However, in the areas that Pepco is afforded accounting policy choices, 87 management does not believe that the application of different accounting policies than those that it chose would materially impact its financial condition or results of operations. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, such as Statement of Position 94 6 "Disclosure of Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties," requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Examples of significant estimates used by Pepco include the calculation of future cash flows and fair value amounts for use in asset impairment evaluations, pension and other post retirement benefits assumptions, unbilled revenue calculations, and judgment involved with assessing the probability of recovery of regulatory assets. Although Pepco believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available . Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Long Lived Assets Impairment Evaluation Pepco believes that the estimates involved in its long term asset impairment evaluation process represent "Critical Accounting Estimates" because they (1) are highly susceptible to change from period to period because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about undiscounted and discounted future cash flows and fair values, which are inherently uncertain, (2) actual results could vary from those used in Pepco estimates and the impact of such variations could be material, and (3) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on Pepcos assets as well as the net loss related to an impairment charge could be material. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" (SFAS No. 144), an impairment loss shall only be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. The asset is deemed to not be recoverable when its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. In order to estimate an assets future cash flows, Pepco considers historical cash flows. Pepco uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel costs, legislative initiatives, and operating costs. Pension and Other Post retirement Benefit Plans Pepco believes that the estimates involved in reporting the costs of providing pension and other post retirement benefits represent "Critical Accounting Estimates" because (1) they are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of assumptions which are subjective in nature, (2) they are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience, and (3)changes in assumptions could impact Pepcos expected future cash funding requirements for the plans and would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations, the reported pension and other post retirement benefit liability on the balance sheet, and the reported annual net periodic pension and other post retirement benefit cost on the income statement. In terms of quantifying the anticipated impact of a change in assumptions, Pepco estimates that a .25% change in the 88 discount rate used to value the benefit obligations could result in a $5 million impact on its consolidated balance sheets and income statements. Additionally, Pepco estimates that a .25% change in the expected return on plan assets could result in a $3 million impact on the consolidated balance sheets and income statements and a .25% change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate could result in a $.6 million impact on its consolidated balance sheets and income statements. Pepcos management consults with its actuaries and investment consultants when selecting its plan assumptions. Pepco follows the guidance of SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" (SFAS No. 87), and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Post retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" (SFAS. No. 106), when accounting for these benefits. Under these accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. In accordance with these standards, the impact of changes in these assumptions and the difference between actual and expected or estimated results on pension and post retirement obligations is generally recognized over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans rather than immediately recognized in the income statement. Regulation of Power Delivery Operations The requirements of SFAS No. 71 apply to Pepcos business. Pepco believes that the judgment involved in accounting for its regulated activities represent "Critical Accounting Estimates" because (1) a significant amount of judgment is required (including but not limited to the interpretation of laws and regulatory commission orders) to assess the probability of the recovery of regulatory assets, (2) actual results and interpretations could vary from those used in Pepcos estimates and the impact of such variations could be material, and (3) the impact that writing off a regulatory asset would have on Pepcos assets and the net loss related to the charge could be material. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS New Accounting Policies Adopted SFAS No. 143 Pepco adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 143 entitled "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" (SFAS No. 143) on January 1, 2003. This Statement establishes the accounting and reporting standards for measuring and recording asset retirement obligations. Based on the implementation of SFAS No. 143, $76.4 million and $72.1 million in asset removal costs at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, have been reclassified from accumulated depreciation to a regulatory liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. SFAS No. 150 Effective July 1, 2003 Pepco implemented SFAS No. 150 entitled "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity" (SFAS No. 150). This Statement established standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its Consolidated Balance Sheet certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The Statement resulted in Pepcos reclassification (initially as of September 30, 2003) of its "Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trust Which Holds Solely Parent Junior Subordinated Debentures" (TOPrS) and "Mandatorily Redeemable Serial Preferred 89 Stock" on its Consolidated Balance Sheet to a long term liability classification. Additionally, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 150, dividends on the TOPrS and Mandatorily Redeemable Serial Preferred Stock, declared subsequent to the July 1, 2003 implementation of SFAS No. 150, are recorded as interest expense in Pepcos Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2003. In accordance with the transition provisions of SFAS No. 150, prior period amounts were not reclassified on either the consolidated balance sheet or consolidated statement of earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Potomac Electric Power Company Trust I redeemed all $125 million of its 7.375% Trust Originated Preferred Securities at par and therefore they were not included on the accompanying December 31, 2003 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Accordingly, Pepcos Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2003 reflects only the reclassification of Pepcos Mandatorily Redeemable Serial Preferred Stock into its long term liability section. FIN 45 Pepco applied the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" (FIN 45), commencing in 2003 to their agreements that contain guarantee and indemnification clauses. These provisions expand those required by FASB Statement No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," by requiring a guarantor to recognize a liability on its balance sheet for the fair value of obligation it assumes under certain guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002 and to disclose certain types of guarantees, even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantors performance under the guarantee is remote. As of December 31, 2003, Pepco did not have material obligations under guarantees or indemnifications issued or modified after December 31, 2002, which are required to be recognized as a liability on its consolidated balance sheets. FIN 46 In January 2003 FIN 46 was issued. FIN 46 was revised and superseded by FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" (FIN 46R) which clarified some of the provisions of FIN 46 and exempted certain entities from its requirements. As of December 31, 2003, Pepco did not have any entities that were impacted by the provisions of FIN 46. RISK FACTORS The business and operations of Pepco are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the events or conditions identified below. These events or conditions could have an adverse effect on the business of Pepco, including, depending on the circumstances, its results of operations and financial condition. Pepco is a public utility that is subject to substantial governmental regulation. If Pepco receives unfavorable regulatory treatment, Pepcos business could be negatively affected. 90 Pepcos utility business is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local regulatory agencies that significantly affects its operations. Pepcos operations are regulated in Maryland by the MPSC and in Washington, D.C. by the DCPSC with respect to, among other things, the rates it can charge retail customers for the delivery of electricity. In addition, the rates that Pepco can charge for electricity transmission are regulated by the FERC. Pepco cannot change delivery or transmission rates without approval by the applicable regulatory authority. While the approved delivery and transmission rates are intended to permit Pepco to recover its costs of service and earn a reasonable rate of return, Pepcos profitability is affected by the rates it is able to charge. In addition, if the costs incurred by Pepco in operating its transmission and distribution facilities exceed the allowed amounts for costs included in the approved rates, Pepcos financial results will be adversely affected. Pepco also is required to have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from governmental agencies that regulate its business. Pepco believes that it has obtained the material permits, approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations and that its business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, Pepco is unable to predict the impact of future regulatory activities of any of these agencies on its business. Changes in or reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations, or the imposition of new laws or regulations, may require Pepco to incur additional expenses or to change the way it conducts its operations. Pepcos business could be adversely affected by the Mirant bankruptcy. In 2000, Pepco sold substantially all of its electricity generation assets to Mirant. As part of the sale, Pepco entered into several ongoing contractual arrangements with Mirant and certain of its subsidiaries. On July 14, 2003, Mirant and most of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas. Depending on the outcome of the proceedings, the Mirant bankruptcy could adversely affect on Pepcos business. See "Relationship with Mirant Corporation." Pepco could be required to make additional divestiture proceeds gain sharing payments to customers in the District of Columbia and Maryland. Pepco currently is involved in regulatory proceedings in Maryland and the District of Columbia related to the sharing of the net proceeds from the sale of its generation related assets. The principal issue in the proceedings is whether Pepco should be required to share with customers the excess deferred income taxes and accumulated deferred investment tax credits associated with the sold assets and, if so, whether such sharing would violate the normalization provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and its implementing regulations. Depending on the outcome of the proceedings, Pepco could be required to make additional gain sharing payments to customers and payments to the IRS in the amount of the associated accumulated deferred investment tax credits, and Pepco might be unable to use accelerated depreciation on District of Columbia and Maryland allocated or assigned property. See "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition an d Results of Operations Regulatory and Other Matters." The operating results of Pepco fluctuate on a seasonal basis and can be adversely affected by changes in weather. Pepcos electric utility business is seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on its operating performance. Demand for electricity 91 is generally greater in the summer months associated with cooling and the winter months associated with heating as compared to other times of the year. Accordingly, Pepco historically has generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer. Pepcos facilities may not operate as planned or may require significant maintenance expenditures, which could decrease its revenues or increase its expenses. Operation of transmission and distribution facilities involves many risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment, accidents, labor disputes and performance below expected levels. Older facilities and equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures for additions or upgrades to keep them operating at peak efficiency, to comply with changing environmental requirements, or to provide reliable operations. Natural disasters and weather related incidents, including tornadoes, hurricanes and snow and ice storms, also can disrupt transmission and distribution delivery systems. Operation of transmission and distribution facilities below expected capacity levels can reduce revenues and result in the incurrence of additional expenses that may not be recoverable from customers or through insurance. Furthermore, if Pepco is unable to perform its contractual obligat ions for any of these reasons, it may incur penalties or damages. Pepcos transmission facilities are interconnected with the facilities of other transmission facility owners whose actions could have a negative impact on Pepcos operations. The transmission facilities of Pepco are directly interconnected with the transmission facilities of contiguous utilities and as such are part of an interstate power transmission grid. The FERC has designated a number of regional transmission operators to coordinate the operation of portions of the interstate transmission grid. Pepco is a member of PJM, which is the regional transmission operator that coordinates the movement of electricity in all or parts of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Pepco operates its transmission facilities under the direction and control of PJM. PJM and the other regional transmission operators have established sophisticated systems that are designed to ensure the reliability of the operation of transmission facilities and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impact on the operations of the other utilities. Ho wever, the systems put in place by PJM and the other regional transmission operators may not always be adequate to prevent problems at other utilities from causing service interruptions in the transmission facilities of Pepco. If Pepco were to suffer such a service interruption, it could have a negative impact on its business. The cost of compliance with environmental laws is significant and new environmental laws may increase Pepcos expenses. Pepcos operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations, relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources, site remediation, and health and safety. These laws and regulations require Pepco to incur expenses to, among other things, conduct site remediation and perform environmental monitoring. Pepco also may be required to pay significant remediation costs with respect to third party sites. If Pepco fails to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond its control, such failure could result in the assessment of civil or criminal 92 penalties and liabilities and the need to expend significant sums to come into compliance. In addition, Pepco incurs costs to obtain and comply with a variety of environmental permits, licenses, inspections and other approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if Pepco fails to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, operations at affected facilities could be halted or subjected to additional costs. New environmental laws and regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, could impose more stringent limitations on Pepcos operations or require it to incur significant additional costs. Pepcos current compliance strategy may not successfully address the relevant standards and interpretations of the future. Changes in technology may adversely affect Pepcos electricity delivery businesses. Increased conservation efforts and advances in technology could reduce demand for electricity supply and distribution, which could adversely affect Pepcos business. In addition, changes in technology also could alter the channels through which retail electric customers buy electricity, which could adversely affect Pepcos business. Acts of terrorism could adversely affect Pepcos business. The threat of or actual acts of terrorism may affect Pepcos operations in unpredictable ways and may cause changes in the insurance markets, force Pepco to increase security measures and cause disruptions of power markets. If any of Pepcos transmission or distribution facilities were to be a direct target, or an indirect casualty, of an act of terrorism, its operations could be adversely affected. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism also could affect the ability of Pepco to raise needed capital. Pepcos insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all casualty losses that it might incur. Pepco currently has insurance coverage for its facilities and operations in amounts and with deductibles that it considers appropriate. However, there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, some risks, such as weather related casualties, may not be insurable. In the case of loss or damage to property, plant or equipment, there is no assurance that the insurance proceeds, if any, received will be sufficient to cover the entire cost of replacement or repair. Pepco may be adversely affected by economic conditions. Periods of slowed economic activity generally result in decreased demand for power, particularly by industrial and large commercial customers. As a consequence, recessions or other downturns in the economy may result in decreased revenues and cash flows for Pepco. Pepco is dependent on its ability to successfully access capital markets. An inability to access capital may adversely affect its business. Pepco relies on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity and to satisfy its capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from its operations. Capital 93 market disruptions, or a downgrade in Pepcos credit ratings, would increase the cost of borrowing or could adversely affect its ability to access one or more financial markets. Disruptions to the capital markets could include, but are not limited to: recession or an economic slowdown; the bankruptcy of one or more energy companies; significant increases in the prices for oil or other fuel; a terrorist attack or threatened attacks; or a significant transmission failure. Pepco may be required to, or may elect to, make significant cash contributions to the Retirement Plan. Pepco follows the guidance of SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" in accounting for pension benefits under the Retirement Plan, a non contributory defined benefit plan in which Pepcos employees participate. In accordance with these accounting standards, Pepco makes assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. Changes in assumptions such as the use of a different discount rate or expected return on plan assets, affects the calculation of projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit obligation, reported pension liability on Pepcos balance sheet, and reported annual net periodic pension benefit cost on Pepcos income statement. Furthermore, as a result of actual pension plan experience being different from expected, the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) could be greater than the fair value of pension plan assets. If this were to occur, Pepco could be required to recognize an additional minimum liability as prescribed by SFAS No. 87. The liability would be recorded as a reduction to common equity through a charge to Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), and would not affect net income for the year. The charge to OCI would be restored through common equity in future periods when the fair value of plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation. PHIs funding policy is to make cash contributions to the pension plan sufficient for plan assets to exceed the ABO, and avoid the recognition of an additional minimum liability. Use of alternative assumptions could also impact the expected future cash funding requirements for the Retirement Plan if it did not meet the minimum funding requirements of ERISA. Energy companies are subject to adverse publicity, which may render Pepco vulnerable to negative regulatory and litigation outcomes. The energy sector has been among the sectors of the economy that have been the subject of highly publicized allegations of misconduct in recent years. In addition, many utility companies have been publicly criticized for their performance during recent natural disasters and weather related incidents. Adverse publicity of this nature may render legislatures, regulatory authorities, and tribunals less likely to view energy companies such as Pepco in a favorable light and may cause them to be susceptible to adverse outcomes with respect to decisions by such bodies. Because Pepco is a wholly owned subsidiary of PHI, PHI can exercise substantial control over its dividend policy and business and operations. All of the members of Pepcos board of directors, as well as many of Pepcos executive officers, are officers of PHI. Among other decisions, Pepcos board is responsible for decisions regarding payment of dividends, financing and 94 capital raising activities, and acquisition and disposition of assets. Within the limitations of applicable law, including limitations imposed by PUHCA, and subject to the financial covenants under Pepcos outstanding debt instruments, Pepcos board of directors will base its decisions concerning the amount and timing of dividends, and other business decisions, on Pepcos earnings, cash flow and capital structure, but may also take into account the business plans and financial requirements of PHI and its other subsidiaries.

All amounts in the tables below are in millions. Electric Revenues 2003 2002 Change Regulated electric revenues $1,047.1 $1,036.4 $10.7 Non regulated electric revenues 2.9 3.4 (0.5) Total electric revenues $1,050.0 $1,039.8 $10.2 The table above shows the amounts of electric revenues earned that are subject to price regulation (regulated) and that are not subject to price regulation (non regulated). "Regulated electric revenues" include revenues for delivery (transmission and distribution) service and electricity supply service within the service areas of DPL. Regulated Electric Revenues The increase in "Regulated electric revenues" was primarily due to the following: (i) a $20.2 million increase from 4% higher sales in residential and commercial sales offset by 6% lower industrial sales, (ii) a $17.1 million increase from higher sales to Delaware Municipal Electric Corporation, (iii) a $9.1 million decrease in weather related sales, (iv) a $3.3 million decrease due to lower rates for residential space heating, (v) a $2.4 million decrease in interchange sales, and (vi) an $11.8 million decrease in sales due to more use of alternative suppliers by customers. Customers who have chosen alternate suppliers accounted for 16% of billed sales for the 2003 period compared to 10% for the 2002 period. Gas Revenues 2003 2002 Change Regulated gas revenues $153.9 $148.3 $ 5.6 Non regulated gas revenues 37.1 29.8 7.3 Total gas revenues $191.0 $178.1 $12.9 DPL has gas revenues from natural gas sales to retail customers connected to DPLs gas distribution facilities, which generally are subject to price regulation, and from the transportation of natural gas for customers. The table above shows the amounts of gas revenues from sources that were subject to price regulation (regulated) and that were not subject to price regulation (non regulated). The increase in "Regulated gas revenues" primarily resulted from higher revenues of $17.9 million from colder winter weather in 2003, and a $5.6 million increase in residential space heating sales. The increases were partially offset by rate decreases of $15.2 million primarily resulting from Gas Cost Rate decreases effective November 2002 and 2003, 98 and other variances totaling a $2.7 million decrease. Heating degree days increased by 16% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. The increase in "Non regulated gas revenues" is primarily due to an increase in sales to large industrial customers. Operating Expenses Electric Fuel and Purchased Energy "Electric fuel and purchased energy" increased by $22.5 million to $699.5 million for 2003, from $677.0 million for 2002. The increase was due to increased POLR and SOS sales during 2003. Gas Purchased "Gas purchased" increased by $7.4 million to $132.3 million for 2003, from $124.9 million for 2002. The over all increase was due to increased costs of natural gas for the regulated gas delivery business. Merger related Costs DPLs operating results for 2002 included costs related to the Conectiv/Pepco Merger of $9.7 million ($5.8 million after income taxes). The $9.7 million of costs included the following: (i) $8.2 million for severances and stock options settled in cash; and (ii) $1.5 million for contributions to certain funds based on the terms of orders issued by the MPSC and DPSC. Based on the terms of the settlement agreements and Commission orders in the States having regulatory jurisdiction over DPL, none of the costs related to the Conectiv/Pepco Merger are recoverable in future customer rate increases. Such costs are, and will be, excluded from studies submitted in base rate filings. Other Operation and Maintenance Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased by $4.2 million to $174.5 million for 2003, from $178.7 million for 2002. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in estimated uncollectible accounts receivable which resulted in lower bad debt expense of approximately $6.9 million and a $1.5 million decrease in rent expense due to lower building and property rents. The decreases were partially offset by incremental storm costs of $2.5 million incurred due to Hurricane Isabel. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by $8.4 million to $73.7 million for 2003, from $82.1 million for 2002. The decrease was primarily due a $10.3 million reduction in the amortization of recoverable stranded costs partially offset by an increase of $1.9 million in depreciation of plant in service. Other Income (Expenses) Other expenses decreased by $0.3 million to a net expense of $33.0 million for 2003, from a net expense of $33.3 million for 2002 primarily due to the following: (i) $9.3 million decrease in interest charges can be attributed to the reduction in long term debt from prior year, (ii) a $3.7 million decrease in money pool interest income, and (iii) a $2.8 million 99 increase in interest expense due to distributions on mandatorily redeemable preferred securities that in accordance with SFAS No. 150 were reclassified to interest expense. Income Taxes DPLs effective tax rate in 2003 and 2002 was 41% and 40%, respectively, as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. In both years, the major reason for this difference is state income taxes (net of federal benefit). RISK FACTORS The business and operations of DPL are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the events or conditions identified below. These events or conditions could have an adverse effect on the business of DPL, including, depending on the circumstances, its results of operations and financial condition. DPL is a public utility that is subject to substantial governmental regulation. If DPL receives unfavorable regulatory treatment, DPLs business could be negatively affected. DPLs utility business is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local regulatory agencies that significantly affects its operations. DPLs operations are regulated in Maryland by the MPSC, in Delaware by the DPSC and in Virginia by the VSCC with respect to, among other things, the rates it can charge retail customers for the delivery of electricity and gas. In addition, the rates that DPL can charge for electricity transmission are regulated by the FERC. DPL cannot change delivery or transmission rates without approval by the applicable regulatory authority. While the approved delivery and transmission rates are intended to permit DPL to recover its costs of service and earn a reasonable rate of return, DPLs profitability is affected by the rates it is able to charge. In addition, if the costs incurred by DPL in operating its transmission and distribution facilities exceed the allowed amounts for costs included in the approv ed rates, DPLs financial results will be adversely affected. DPL also is required to have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from governmental agencies that regulate its business. DPL believes that it has obtained the material permits, approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations and that its business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, DPL is unable to predict the impact of future regulatory activities of any of these agencies on its business. Changes in or reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations, or the imposition of new laws or regulations, may require DPL to incur additional expenses or to change the way it conducts its operations. The operating results of DPL fluctuate on a seasonal basis and can be adversely affected by changes in weather. DPLs electric utility business is seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on its operating performance. Demand for electricity is generally greater in the summer months associated with cooling and demand for electricity and gas is generally greater in the winter months associated with heating as compared to other times of the year. Accordingly, DPL 100 historically has generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer. DPLs facilities may not operate as planned or may require significant maintenance expenditures, which could decrease its revenues or increase its expenses. Operation of transmission and distribution facilities involves many risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment, accidents, labor disputes and performance below expected levels. Older facilities and equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures for additions or upgrades to keep them operating at peak efficiency, to comply with changing environmental requirements, or to provide reliable operations. Natural disasters and weather related incidents, including tornadoes, hurricanes and snow and ice storms, also can disrupt transmission and distribution delivery systems. Operation of transmission and distribution facilities below expected capacity levels can reduce revenues and result in the incurrence of additional expenses that may not be recoverable from customers or through insurance. Furthermore, if DPL is unable to perform its contractual obligations for any of these reasons, it may incur penalties or damages. DPLs transmission facilities are interconnected with the facilities of other transmission facility owners whose actions could have a negative impact on the DPLs operations. The electricity transmission facilities of DPL are directly interconnected with the transmission facilities of contiguous utilities and as such are part of an interstate power transmission grid. The FERC has designated a number of regional transmission operators to coordinate the operation of portions of the interstate transmission grid. DPL is a member of PJM, which is the regional transmission operator that coordinates the movement of electricity in all or parts of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. DPL operates its transmission facilities under the direction and control of PJM. PJM and the other regional transmission operators have established sophisticated systems that are designed to ensure the reliability of the operation of transmission facilities and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impact on the operations of the other utilities. How ever, the systems put in place by PJM and the other regional transmission operators may not always be adequate to prevent problems at other utilities from causing service interruptions in the transmission facilities of DPL. If DPL were to suffer such a service interruption, it could have a negative impact on its business. The cost of compliance with environmental laws is significant and new environmental laws may increase DPLs expenses. DPLs operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations, relating to air quality, water quality, spill prevention, waste management, natural resources, site remediation, and health and safety. These laws and regulations require DPL to incur expenses to, among other things, conduct site remediation and obtain permits. DPL also may be required to pay significant remediation costs with respect to third party sites. If DPL fails to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond its control, such failure could result in the assessment of civil or 101 criminal penalties and liabilities and the need to expend significant sums to come into compliance. In addition, DPL incurs costs to obtain and comply with a variety of environmental permits, licenses, inspections and other approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if DPL fails to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, operations at affected facilities could be halted or subjected to additional costs. New environmental laws and regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, could impose more stringent limitations on DPLs operations or require it to incur significant additional costs. DPLs current compliance strategy may not successfully address the relevant standards and interpretations of the future. Changes in technology may adversely affect DPLs electricity and gas delivery businesses. Increased conservation efforts and advances in technology could reduce demand for electricity and gas supply and distribution, which could adversely affect DPLs business. In addition, changes in technology also could alter the channels through which retail electric customers buy electricity, which could adversely affect DPLs business. Acts of terrorism could adversely affect DPLs business. The threat of or actual acts of terrorism may affect DPLs operations in unpredictable ways and may cause changes in the insurance markets, force DPL to increase security measures and cause disruptions of power markets. If any of DPLs transmission or distribution facilities were to be a direct target, or an indirect casualty, of an act of terrorism, its operations could be adversely affected. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism also could affect the ability of DPL to raise needed capital. DPLs insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all casualty losses that it might incur. DPL currently has insurance coverage for its facilities and operations in amounts and with deductibles that it considers appropriate. However, there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, some risks, such as weather related casualties, may not be insurable. In the case of loss or damage to property, plant or equipment, there is no assurance that the insurance proceeds, if any, received will be sufficient to cover the entire cost of replacement or repair. DPL may be adversely affected by economic conditions. Periods of slowed economic activity generally result in decreased demand for power, particularly by industrial and large commercial customers. As a consequence, recessions or other downturns in the economy may result in decreased revenues and cash flows for DPL. 102 DPL is dependent on its ability to successfully access capital markets. An inability to access capital may adversely affect its business. DPL relies on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity and to satisfy its capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from its operations. Capital market disruptions, or a downgrade in DPLs credit ratings, would increase the cost of borrowing or could adversely affect its ability to access one or more financial markets. Disruptions to the capital markets could include, but are not limited to: recession or an economic slowdown; the bankruptcy of one or more energy companies; significant increases in the prices for oil or other fuel; a terrorist attack or threatened attacks; or a significant transmission failure. DPL may be required to, or may elect to, make significant cash contributions to the Retirement Plan. DPL follows the guidance of SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" in accounting for pension benefits under the Retirement Plan, a non contributory defined benefit plan in which DPLs employees participate. In accordance with these accounting standards, DPL makes assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. Changes in assumptions such as the use of a different discount rate or expected return on plan assets, affects the calculation of projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit obligation, reported pension liability on DPLs balance sheet, and reported annual net periodic pension benefit cost on DPLs income statement. Furthermore, as a result of actual pension plan experience being different from expected, the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) could be greater than the fair value of pension plan assets. If this were to occur, DPL could be required to recognize an additional minimum liability as prescribed by SFAS No. 87. The liability would be recorded as a reduction to common equity through a charge to Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), and would not affect net income for the year. The charge to OCI would be restored through common equity in future periods when the fair value of plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation. PHIs funding policy is to make cash contributions to the pension plan sufficient for plan assets to exceed the ABO, and avoid the recognition of an additional minimum liability. Use of alternative assumptions could also impact the expected future cash funding requirements for the Retirement Plan if it did not meet the minimum funding requirements of ERISA. Energy companies are subject to adverse publicity, which may render DPL vulnerable to negative regulatory and litigation outcomes. The energy sector has been among the sectors of the economy that have been the subject of highly publicized allegations of misconduct in recent years. In addition, many utility companies have been publicly criticized for their performance during recent natural disasters and weather related incidents. Adverse publicity of this nature may render legislatures, regulatory authorities, and tribunals less likely to view energy companies 103 such as DPL in a favorable light and may cause them to be susceptible to adverse outcomes with respect to decisions by such bodies. Because DPL is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of PHI, PHI can exercise substantial control over its dividend policy and business and operations. All of the members of DPLs board of directors, as well as many of DPLs executive officers, are officers of PHI. Among other decisions, DPLs board is responsible for decisions regarding payment of dividends, financing and capital raising activities, and acquisition and disposition of assets. Within the limitations of applicable law, including limitations imposed by PUHCA, and subject to the financial covenants under DPLs outstanding debt instruments, DPLs board of directors will base its decisions concerning the amount and timing of dividends, and other business decisions, on DPLs earnings, cash flow and capital structure, but may also take into account the business plans and financial requirements of PHI and its other subsidiaries. 104 THIS PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK. 105 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ATLANTIC CITY ELECTRIC COMPANY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Results of Operations discussion for ACE is presented only for the year ended December 31, 2003 in accordance with General Instruction I(2)(a). All amounts in the table below are in millions. Electric Revenues 2003 2002 Change Regulated electric revenues $1,223.6 $1,078.9 $144.7 Non regulated electric revenues 12.4 5.8 6.6 Total electric revenues $1,236.0 $1,084.7 $151.3 The table above shows the amounts of electric revenues earned that are subject to price regulation (regulated) and that are not subject to price regulation (non regulated). "Regulated electric revenues" include revenues for delivery (transmission and distribution) service and electricity supply service within the service areas of ACE. Regulated Electric Revenues The increase in "Regulated electric revenues" was due to the following: (i) regulated electric retail revenues increased $18.4 million. The $18.4 million increase was attributed to: (i) $18.9 million increase from residential and small commercial business growth, (ii) $9.6 million increase from August 2003 rate increase, (iii) a $12.5 million decrease from more customers choosing alternative suppliers, (iv) $4.7 million decrease in weather related sales, and (v) a $7.1 million increase from other sales and rate variances. Customers who have chosen alternate suppliers accounted for 11% of billed sales for the 2003 period compared to 8% for the corresponding 2002 period. Interchange sales increased $126.3 million due to the New Jersey NJBPU mandate that each New Jersey utility participate in an auction to allow third party energy suppliers to provide Basic Generation Service to the customers in its territory. As of August 1, 2002, approximately 80% of the customer megawatts per hour load, which ACE was serving, began to be served by other suppliers. This means that ACE now has generation to sell to PJM, which was previously used by supply customers in the territory. As of December 31, 2003, 100% of the ACE customer BGS megawatts per hour load is being supplied by other suppliers through the auction process, so now all ACE generation is sold to PJM. Operating Expenses Electric Fuel and Purchased Energy "Electric fuel and purchased energy" increased by $92.6 million to $775.1 million for 2003, from $682.5 million for 2002. There was a $147.4 million increase due to colder winter weather, higher prices and increased interchange sales partially offset by a decrease of $50.1 million in purchased capacity. In August 2002, due to the NJBPU required auction sale 106 of BGS load, ACE began supplying 22% of its BGS energy requirements. With the drop in energy supply, there was a corresponding drop in capacity obligations under PJM formulas. Merger related Costs ACEs operating results for 2002 include costs related to the Conectiv/Pepco Merger of $38.1 million ($22.6 million after income taxes). The $38.1 million of costs included the following: (i) a $30.5 million write down of deferred electric service costs based on the terms of the Decision and Order issued by the NJBPU on July 3, 2002 that required ACE to forgo recovery of such costs effective upon the Conectiv/Pepco Merger; (ii) $6.6 million for severances and stock options settled in cash; and (iii) $1.0 million for a contribution to a certain fund based on the terms of an order issued by the NJBPU. Based on the terms of the settlement agreements and Commission orders in the States having regulatory jurisdiction over ACE, none of the costs related to the Conectiv/Pepco Merger are recoverable in future customer rate increases. Such costs are, and will be, excluded from studies submitted in base rate filings. Other Operation and Maintenance Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased by $32.0 million to $211.6 million for 2003, from $243.6 million for 2002. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in estimated uncollectible accounts which resulted in a $17.4 million decrease in bad debt expense, a $6.0 million decrease in general expenses and a $7.9 million decrease resulting from a severance accrual reversal made for Deepwater. The decreases were partially offset by incremental storm restoration costs of $1.0 million incurred due to Hurricane Isabel. Impairment Losses The impairment loss of $9.5 million in 2002 represents the write down of the Deepwater power plant due to impairment of value based on the results of a competitive bidding process. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $43.3 million to $112.5 million for 2003, from $69.2 million for 2002 primarily due to the following: (i) $24.1 million for amortization of bondable transition property as result of transition bonds issued in December 2002, and (ii) $18.1 million for amortization of a regulatory tax asset related to New Jersey stranded costs. Deferred Electric Service Costs Deferred electric service costs decreased by $64.3 million due to lower costs related to ACE providing Basic Generation Service and due to the $27.5 million charge described below. The balance for ACEs deferred electric service costs was $185.9 million as of December 31, 2003. On July 31, 2003, the NJBPU issued its Summary Order permitting ACE to begin collecting a portion of the deferred costs that were incurred as a result of EDECA and to reset rates to recover on going costs incurred as a result of EDECA. The Summary Order approved the recovery of $125 million of the deferred balance over a ten year amortization period beginning August 1, 2003. The Summary Order also transferred to ACEs pending base case for further 107 consideration approximately $25.4 million of the deferred balance. The Summary Order estimated the overall deferral balance as of July 31, 2003 at $195 million, of which $44.6 million was disallowed recovery by ACE. Since the amounts included in this decision are based on estimates through July 31, 2003, the actual ending deferred cost balance will be subject to review and finalization by the NJPBU and ACE. The approved rates became effective on August 6, 2003. Based on analysis of the order and in accordance with prevailing accounting rules, ACE recorded a charge of $27.5 million ($16.3 million after tax) during the second quarter of 2003. This charge is in addition to amounts previously accrued for disallowance. ACE believes the record does not justify the level of disallowance imposed by the NJBPU. ACE is awaiting the final written order from the NJBPU and is evaluating its options related to this decision. The NJBPUs action is not appealable until a f inal written order has been issued. Other Income (Expenses) Other expenses increased by $13.2 million to a net expense of $49.4 million for 2003, from a net expense of $36.2 million for 2002. This increase is primarily due to higher interest expense of $6.1 million due to increased amounts of outstanding long term debt, a $1.7 million decrease in billings to customers to recover ACEs income tax expense on contributions in aid of construction, a $2.4 million decrease in interest income accrued in 2003 on deferred electric service costs and a $0.9 million increase in interest expense due to distributions on mandatorily redeemable preferred securities that in accordance with SFAS No. 150 were reclassified to interest expense. Income Taxes ACEs effective tax rate in 2003 was 40% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reason for this difference is state income taxes (net of federal benefit). In 2002, the effective rate was 37% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference are state income taxes (net of federal benefit) partially offset by the flow through Deferred Investment Tax Credits and other book tax differences. Extraordinary Item On July 25, 2003, the NJBPU approved the determination of stranded costs related to ACEs January 31, 2003 petition relating to its B.L. England generating facility. The NJBPU approved recovery of $149.5 million. As a result of the order, ACE reversed $10 million of accruals in June 2003 for the possible disallowances related to these stranded costs. The credit to income of $5.9 million (after tax) is classified as an extraordinary gain in ACEs financial statements, since the original accrual was part of an extraordinary charge in conjunction with the accounting for competitive restructuring in 1999. RISK FACTORS The business and operations of ACE are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the events or conditions identified below. These events or conditions could have an adverse effect on the business of ACE, including, depending on the circumstances, its results of operations and financial condition. 108 ACE is a public utility that is subject to substantial governmental regulation. If ACE receives unfavorable regulatory treatment, ACEs business could be negatively affected. ACEs utility business is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local regulatory agencies that significantly affects its operations. ACEs operations are regulated by the NJBPU with respect to, among other things, the rates it can charge retail customers for the delivery of electricity. In addition, the rates that ACE can charge for electricity transmission are regulated by the FERC. ACE cannot change delivery or transmission rates without approval by the applicable regulatory authority. While the approved delivery and transmission rates are intended to permit ACE to recover its costs of service and earn a reasonable rate of return, ACEs profitability is affected by the rates it is able to charge. In addition, if the costs incurred by ACE in operating its transmission and distribution facilities exceed the allowed amounts for costs included in the approved rates, ACEs financial results will be adversely affected. ACE also is required to have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from governmental agencies that regulate its business. ACE believes that it has obtained the material permits, approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations and that its business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, ACE is unable to predict the impact of future regulatory activities of any of these agencies on its business. Changes in or reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations, or the imposition of new laws or regulations, may require ACE to incur additional expenses or to change the way it conducts its operations. The operating results of ACE fluctuate on a seasonal basis and can be adversely affected by changes in weather. ACEs electric utility business is seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on its operating performance. Demand for electricity is generally greater in the summer months associated with cooling and the winter months associated with heating as compared to other times of the year. Accordingly, ACE historically has generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer. ACEs facilities may not operate as planned or may require significant maintenance expenditures, which could decrease its revenues or increase its expenses. Operation of generation, transmission and distribution facilities involves many risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment, accidents, labor disputes and performance below expected levels. Older facilities and equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures for additions or upgrades to keep them operating at peak efficiency, to comply with changing environmental requirements, or to provide reliable operations. Natural disasters and weather related incidents, including tornadoes, hurricanes and snow and ice storms, also can disrupt generation, transmission and distribution delivery systems. Operation of generation, transmission and distribution facilities below expected capacity levels can reduce revenues and result in the incurrence of additional expenses that may not be recoverable from customers or through insurance. Furthermore, if ACE is unable to perf orm its contractual obligations for any of these reasons, it may incur penalties or damages. 109 ACEs transmission facilities are interconnected with the facilities of other transmission facility owners whose actions could have a negative impact on the ACEs operations. The transmission facilities of ACE are directly interconnected with the transmission facilities of contiguous utilities and as such are part of an interstate power transmission grid. The FERC has designated a number of regional transmission operators to coordinate the operation of portions of the interstate transmission grid. ACE is a member of PJM, which is the regional transmission operator that coordinates the movement of electricity in all or parts of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. ACE operates its transmission facilities under the direction and control of PJM. PJM and the other regional transmission operators have established sophisticated systems that are designed to ensure the reliability of the operation of transmission facilities and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impact on the operations of the other utilities. However, the sy stems put in place by PJM and the other regional transmission operators may not always be adequate to prevent problems at other utilities from causing service interruptions in the transmission facilities of ACE. If ACE were to suffer such a service interruption, it could have a negative impact on its business. The cost of compliance with environmental laws is significant and new environmental laws may increase ACEs expenses. ACEs operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations, relating to air quality, water quality, spill prevention, waste management, natural resources, site remediation, and health and safety. These laws and regulations require ACE to incur expenses to, among other things, conduct site remediation and obtain permits. ACE also may be required to pay significant remediation costs with respect to third party sites. If ACE fails to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond its control, such failure could result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities and the need to expend significant sums to come into compliance. In addition, ACE incurs costs to obtain and comply with a variety of environmental permits, licenses, inspections and other approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if ACE fails to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, operations at affected facilities could be halted or subjected to additional costs. New environmental laws and regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, could impose more stringent limitations on ACEs operations or require it to incur significant additional costs. ACEs current compliance strategy may not successfully address the relevant standards and interpretations of the future. Changes in technology may adversely affect ACEs electricity delivery businesses Increased conservation efforts and advances in technology could reduce demand for electricity supply and distribution, which could adversely affect ACEs business. In addition, changes in technology also could alter the channels through which retail electric customers buy electricity, which could adversely affect ACEs business. 110 Acts of terrorism could adversely affect ACEs business. The threat of or actual acts of terrorism may affect ACEs operations in unpredictable ways and may cause changes in the insurance markets, force ACE to increase security measures and cause disruptions of power markets. If any of ACEs generation, transmission or distribution facilities were to be a direct target, or an indirect casualty, of an act of terrorism, its operations could be adversely affected. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism also could affect the ability of ACE to raise needed capital. ACEs insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all casualty losses that it might incur. ACE currently has insurance coverage for its facilities and operations in amounts and with deductibles that it considers appropriate. However, there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, some risks, such as weather related casualties, may not be insurable. In the case of loss or damage to property, plant or equipment, there is no assurance that the insurance proceeds, if any, received will be sufficient to cover the entire cost of replacement or repair. ACE may be adversely affected by economic conditions. Periods of slowed economic activity generally result in decreased demand for power, particularly by industrial and large commercial customers. As a consequence, recessions or other downturns in the economy may result in decreased revenues and cash flows for ACE. ACE is dependent on its ability to successfully access capital markets. An inability to access capital may adversely affect its business. ACE relies on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity and to satisfy its capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from its operations. Capital market disruptions, or a downgrade in ACEs credit ratings, would increase the cost of borrowing or could adversely affect its ability to access one or more financial markets. Disruptions to the capital markets could include, but are not limited to: recession or an economic slowdown; the bankruptcy of one or more energy companies; significant increases in the prices for oil or other fuel; a terrorist attack or threatened attacks; or a significant transmission failure. 111 ACE may be required to, or may elect to, make significant cash contributions to the Retirement Plan. ACE follows the guidance of SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" in accounting for pension benefits under the Retirement Plan, a non contributory defined benefit plan in which ACEs employees participate. In accordance with these accounting standards, ACE makes assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. Changes in assumptions such as the use of a different discount rate or expected return on plan assets, affects the calculation of projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit obligation, reported pension liability on ACEs balance sheet, and reported annual net periodic pension benefit cost on ACEs income statement. Furthermore, as a result of actual pension plan experience being different from expected, the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) could be greater than the fair value of pension plan assets. If this were to occur, ACE could be required to recognize an additional minimum liability as prescribed by SFAS No. 87. The liability would be recorded as a reduction to common equity through a charge to Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), and would not affect net income for the year. The charge to OCI would be restored through common equity in future periods when the fair value of plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation. PHIs funding policy is to make cash contributions to the pension plan sufficient for plan assets to exceed the ABO, and avoid the recognition of an additional minimum liability. Use of alternative assumptions could also impact the expected future cash funding requirements for the Retirement Plan if it did not meet the minimum funding requirements of ERISA. Energy companies are subject to adverse publicity, which may render ACE vulnerable to negative regulatory and litigation outcomes. The energy sector has been among the sectors of the economy that have been the subject of highly publicized allegations of misconduct in recent years. In addition, many utility companies have been publicly criticized for their performance during recent natural disasters and weather related incidents. Adverse publicity of this nature may render legislatures, regulatory authorities, and tribunals less likely to view energy companies such as ACE in a favorable light and may cause them to be susceptible to adverse outcomes with respect to decisions by such bodies. Because ACE is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of PHI, PHI can exercise substantial control over its dividend policy and business and operations. All of the members of ACEs board of directors, as well as many of ACEs executive officers, are officers of PHI. Among other decisions, ACEs board is responsible for decisions regarding payment of dividends, financing and capital raising activities, and acquisition and disposition of assets. Within the limitations of applicable law, including limitations imposed by PUHCA, and subject to the financial covenants under ACEs outstanding debt instruments, ACEs board of directors will base its decisions concerning the amount and timing of dividends, and other business decisions, on ACEs earnings, cash flow and capital structure, but may also take into account the business plans and financial requirements of PHI and its other subsidiaries. 112 THIS PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK. 113 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK PEPCO HOLDINGS COMMITTEE OF CHIEF RISK OFFICERS RECOMMENDED RISK MANAGEMENT DISCLOSURES The following tables present the combined risk management disclosures of Conectiv Energy and Pepco Energy Services for the year ended December 31, 2003. Forward looking data represents 100% of the combined positions of Conectiv Energy and Pepco Energy Services. The tables typically identify three business categories for the competitive energy segment defined as follows: Proprietary trading Standardized contracts entered into to take a view, capture market price changes, and or put capital at risk. These activities are generally accounted for on a mark to market basis under SFAS No. 133. Other energy commodity Contracts associated with energy assets and retail energy marketing activities. Purchases and sales supporting the hedging of such activities including the POLR services supported by Conectiv Energy. Non commodity energy Other activities for the competitive energy segment provided for reconciliation to segment reporting (includes thermal, power plant operating services, energy efficiency and other services business). 114 Table 1 This table identifies the components of gross margin by type of activity (proprietary trading, other energy commodity, and non commodity energy). Further delineation of gross margin by type of accounting treatment is also presented (mark to market vs. accrual accounting treatment).

Contracts that are marked to market through earnings under SFAS No. 133 have been reclassified to "Other Energy Commodity" if their purpose was not speculative. The arbitrage activities and interpool and intrapool short term transactions of the 24 Hour Power Desk, which were formerly reported under "Proprietary Trading," have been retroactively moved to "Other Unregulated Contracts." Also $4.2 million of gross margin has been reclassified out of Proprietary Trading related to the 24 Hour Power Desk from the first quarter of 2003. (2) Includes Generation line of business (LOB), POLR services, origination business, and miscellaneous wholesale and retail commodity sales. As of the second quarter of 2003, this category also includes the arbitrage activities of the 24 Hour Power Desk and any other activities marked to market through the Income Statement under SFAS No. 133 that are not proprietary trading. (3) Includes Conectiv Thermal Systems, Inc. (Conectiv Thermal), Conectiv Operating Services Company, and Pepco Energy Services energy efficiency and other services business. (4) Conectiv Energys proprietary trading experienced the majority of the $67.3 million negative gross margin in the month of February during an extreme run up in natural gas prices. Conectiv Energy also sold a purchased power contract in February that was positively affected by the commodity price run up. The pre tax gain on the sale of this contract was $24.7 million, and the gain is included in the accrual section of the Other Energy Commodity column above because of the contracts classification as a normal purchase. The tax effected gross margin for February 2003 Trading was approximately ($35 million) and the tax effected gain on the long term power contract was approximately $15 million. The net of these numbers is the ($20 million) as reported on a Form 8 K dated March 3, 2003. Most of the remaining loss occurred in January 2003. 115 Table 2 This table provides detail on changes in the competitive energy segments net asset or liability balance sheet position with respect to energy contracts from one period to the next.

Schedule of Credit Risk Exposure on Competitive Wholesale Energy Contracts (Dollars in Millions) December 31, 2003 Rating (1) Exposure Before Credit Collateral (2) Credit Collateral (3) Net Exposure Number of Counterparties Greater Than 10% * Net Exposure of Counterparties Greater Than 10% Investment Grade $184.8 $8.1 $176.7 4 $109.9 Non Investment Grade 6.3 2.6 3.7 Split rating No External Ratings Internal Rated Investment Grade 11.3 11.3 Internal Rated Non Investment Grade 4.2 4.2 Total $206.6 $10.7 $195.9 4 $109.9 Credit reserves $ 3.6 (1) Investment Grade primarily determined using publicly available credit ratings of the counterparty. If the counterparty has provided a guarantee by a higher rated entity (e.g., its parent), it is determined based upon the rating of its guarantor. Included in "Investment Grade" are counterparties with a minimum Standard & Poors or Moodys rating of BBB or Baa3, respectively. If it has a split rating (i.e., rating not uniform between major rating agencies), it is presented separately. (2) Exposure before credit collateral includes the MTM energy contract net assets for open/unrealized transactions, the net receivable/payable for realized transactions and net open positions for contracts not subject to MTM. Amounts due from counterparties are offset by liabilities payable to those counterparties to the extent that legally enforceable netting arrangements are in place. Thus, this column presents the net credit exposure to counterparties after reflecting all allowable netting, but before considering collateral held. (3) Credit collateral the face amount of cash deposits, letters of credit and performance bonds received from counterparties, not adjusted for probability of default, and if applicable property interests (including oil and gas reserves). * Using a percentage of the total exposure Note: Pepco Holdings attempts to minimize credit risk exposure from its competitive wholesale energy counterparties through, among other things, formal credit policies, regular assessments of counterparty creditworthiness that result in the establishment of an internal credit quality score with a corresponding credit limit, monitoring procedures that include stress testing, the use of standard agreements which allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty and collateral requirements under certain circumstances, and has established reserves for credit losses. 120 Table 7 This table provides point in time information on the amount of estimated production and fuel requirements hedged for the competitive energy segments merchant generation facilities (based on economic availability projections). Merchant Plant Owned Assets Hedging Information Estimated Three Calendar Years 2004 2005 2006 Estimated Plant Output Hedged (1) 100% 100% 65% Estimated Plant Gas Requirements Hedges (2) 83% 87% Pepco Holdings portfolio of electric generating plants includes "mid merit" assets and peaking assets. Mid merit electric generating plants are typically combined cycle units that can quickly change their megawatt output level on an economic basis. These plants are generally operated during times when demand for electricity rises and power prices are higher. The above information represents a hedge position for a single point in time and does not reflect the ongoing transactions executed to carry a balanced position. Pepco Holdings dynamically hedges both the estimated plant output and fuel requirements as the projected levels of output and fuel needs change. The percentages above are based on modeled volumetric requirements using data available at December 31, 2003. Hedged output is for on peak periods only. (1) While on peak generation is 100% economically hedged, Pepco Holdings has POLR load requirements that are forecasted to exceed, on average, the dispatch level of generation in the fleet. In total, Pepco Holdings has installed capacity that exceeds the level of POLR. The peaking units are generally not used to meet POLR load requirements. (2) Natural gas is the primary fuel for the majority of the mid merit fleet. Fuel oil is the primary fuel for the majority of the peaking units. 121 Table 8 Value at Risk Associated with Energy Contracts For the Year Ended December 31, 2003 (Dollars in Millions) Pepco Holdings uses a value at risk (VaR) model to assess the market risk of its electricity, gas, coal, and petroleum product commodity activities. The model includes physical forward contracts used for hedging and trading, and commodity derivative instruments. VaR represents a confidence interval of the probability of experiencing a mark to market loss of no more than the indicated amount on instruments or portfolios due to changes in market factors, for a specified time period. Pepco Holdings estimates VaR across its power, gas, coal, and petroleum products commodity business using a delta gamma variance/covariance model with a 95 percent, one tailed confidence level and assuming a one day holding period. Since VaR is an estimate, it is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur. This table provides the VaR for all propriety trading positions of the competitive energy segment. VaR represents the potential gain or loss on energy contracts and or portfolios due to changes in market prices, for a specified time period and confidence level. Proprietary Trading VaR (1) VaR for Energy Derivative Contracts (2) 95% confidence level, one day holding period, one tailed (3) Period end $ $ 6.3 Average for the period $0.6 $ 8.7 High $8.5 $42.3 Low $ $ 1.2 Notes: (1) Includes all derivative contracts held for trading and marked to market under SFAS No. 133. (2) Includes all derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133, including trading positions and cash flow hedges. (3) As VaR calculations are shown in a standard delta or delta/gamma closed form 95% 1 day holding period 1 tail normal distribution form, traditional statistical and financial methods can be employed to reconcile prior 10K and 10Q VaRs to the above approach. In this case, 5 day VaRs divided by the square root of 5 equal 1 day VaRs; and 99% 1 tail VaRs divided by 2.326 times 1.645 equal 95% 1 tail VaRs. Note that these methods of conversion are not valid for converting from 5 day or less holding periods to over 1 month holding periods and should not be applied to "non standard closed form" VaR calculations in any case. 122 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES Pepco Holdings Market Risk Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. Certain of Pepco Holdings financial instruments are exposed to market risk in the form of interest rate risk, equity price risk, commodity risk, and credit and nonperformance risk. Pepco Holdings management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. Management reviews any open positions in accordance with strict policies in order to limit exposure to market risk. Interest Rate Risk Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries debt is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. Pepco Holdings manages interest rates through the use of fixed and, to a lesser extent, variable rate debt. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates on the annual interest costs for short term and variable rate debt was approximately $2.0 million as of December 31, 2003. Equity Price Risk PHI through its subsidiaries holds investments in marketable equity securities and venture capital funds, which invest in securities of technology and service companies related to energy, utility, and communication industries and invests in marketable securities, which consist primarily of preferred stocks with mandatory redemption features and investment grade commercial paper. Pepco Holdings is exposed to equity price risk through the investments in the marketable equity securities and the venture capital funds. The potential change in the fair value of these investments resulting from a hypothetical 10% decrease in quoted securities prices was approximately $3.0 million as of December 31, 2003. Due to the nature of these investments and market conditions, the fair value of these investments may change by substantially more than 10%. Commodity Price Risk Pepco Holdings is at risk for a decrease in market liquidity to levels that affect its capability to execute its commodity participation strategies. PHI believes the commodity markets to be sufficiently liquid to support its market participation. Conectivs participation in wholesale energy markets includes marketing, trading, and arbitrage activities, which expose Conectiv to commodity market risk. To the extent Conectiv has net open positions, controls are in place that are intended to keep risk exposures within management approved risk tolerance levels. Conectiv engages in commodity hedging activities to minimize the risk of market fluctuations associated with the purchase and sale of energy commodities (natural gas, petroleum, coal and electricity). The majority of these hedges relate to the procurement of fuel for its power plants, fixing the cash flows from the plant output, and securing power for electric load service. Conectivs hedging activities are conducted using derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, which are designed to 123 reduce the volatility on future cash flows. Conectivs energy commodity hedging objectives, in accordance with its risk management policy, are primarily the assurance of stable and known cash flows and the fixing of favorable prices and margins when they become available. Conectiv manages to the objective of hedging the variability in future cash flows for forecasted energy output from its generation assets at 75% or greater of such forecasted output over a period of 36 months. As of December 2003, Conectivs average forecasted hedge position for the forward 36 months was projected to meet that objective. Credit and Nonperformance Risk Certain of PHIs subsidiaries agreements may be subject to credit losses and nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, PHI anticipates that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the agreements. PHIs subsidiaries attempt to minimize credit risk exposure to wholesale energy counterparties through, among other things, formal credit policies, regular assessment of counterparty creditworthiness that results in the establishment of a credit limit for each counterparty, monitoring procedures that include stress testing, the use of standard agreements which allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty and collateral requirements under certain circumstances, and has established reserves for credit losses. As of December 31, 2003, credit exposure to wholesale energy counterparties was weighted 87% with investment grade counterparties, 10% with counterparties without external credit quality ratings, and 3% with non investment grade counterparties. Pepco Market Risk Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. Certain of Pepcos financial instruments are exposed to market risk in the form of interest rate risk, equity price risk, commodity risk, and credit and nonperformance risk. Pepcos management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. Management reviews any open positions in accordance with strict policies in order to limit exposure to market risk. Interest Rate Risk Pepcos debt is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. Pepco manages interest rates through the use of fixed and, to a lesser extent, variable rate debt. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates on the annual interest costs for short term debt was approximately $.1 million as of December 31, 2003.
