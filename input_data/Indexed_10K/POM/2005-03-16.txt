MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The information required by this item is contained herein, as follows: Registrants Page No. Pepco Holdings 34 Pepco 99 DPL 129 ACE 138 32 THIS PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK. 33 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PEPCO HOLDINGS, INC. GENERAL OVERVIEW Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI) is a public utility holding company that, through its operating subsidiaries, is engaged primarily in three principal areas of business operations: electricity and natural gas delivery ("Power Delivery"), competitive energy generation, marketing and supply ("Competitive Energy"), and other activities consisting primarily of investments in energy related assets ("Other Non regulated"). The Power Delivery business is the largest component PHIs business. In 2004, Power Delivery was responsible for 61% of PHIs consolidated operating revenues and 70% of its consolidated operating income. The Power Delivery business consists primarily of the transmission and distribution of electric power, which was responsible for 95% of Power Delivery 2004 revenues, and the distribution of natural gas, which contributed 5% of Power Delivery 2004 revenues. The Power Delivery business is conducted by three regulated utility subsidiaries: Potomac Electric Power Company ("Pepco"), Delmarva Power & Light Company ("DPL") and Atlantic City Electric Company ("ACE"), each of which is a regulated public utility in the jurisdictions that compose its service territory. Each company is responsible for the delivery of electricity and, in the case of DPL, natural gas in its service territory, for which it is paid tariff rates established by the local public service commission. Each company also provides default electricity supply to retail customers in its service territory who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier for which it is compensated at regulated rates. The rates each company is permitted to charge for the transmission of electricity is regulated by FERC. This means that the profitability of the Power Delivery business depends on its ability through the rates it is permitted to charge to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on its capital investments. Power Deliverys operating revenue and income are seasonal, and weather patterns may have a material impact on operating results. Historically, Power Delivery operations have generated less revenue and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer. The Competitive Energy business provides competitive generation, marketing and supply of electricity and gas, and related energy management services primarily in the mid Atlantic region. These operations are conducted through Conectiv Energy and Pepco Energy Services, each of which is treated as a separate business segment for financial reporting purposes. In 2004, the Competitive Energy segment, including intercompany transactions, was responsible for 50% of PHIs consolidated operating revenues and 19% of its consolidated operating income. Of this segments operating revenues, 8% of PHIs consolidated operating revenues were attributable to sales to the Power Delivery segment. 34 Conectiv Energy provides wholesale power, capacity and ancillary services in the wholesale markets administered by PJM and also supplies electricity to other wholesale market participants under long term bilateral contracts. Conectiv Energy has a power supply agreement under which it provides DPL with default electricity supply for distribution to customers in Delaware and Virginia. Conectiv Energy also supplies a portion of the default electricity supply that ACE acquires for its distribution customers. Conectiv Energy obtains the electricity required to meet its power supply obligations from its own generation plants, under bilateral contract purchases from other wholesale market participants and from purchases in the PJM wholesale market. Conectiv Energy also sells natural gas and fuel oil to very large end users and to wholesale market participants under bilateral agreements. Pepco Energy Services sells retail electricity and natural gas primarily in the mid Atlantic region and provides integrated energy management services. Pepco Energy Services also provides high voltage construction and maintenance services to utilities and other customers throughout the United States and low voltage electric and telecommunication construction and maintenance services primarily in the Washington, D.C. area. The primary objectives of the Competitive Energy business are to manage Conectiv Energys generation assets to match wholesale energy supply with load and to capture retail energy supply and service opportunities in the mid Atlantic region. The financial results of the Competitive Energy business can be significantly affected by wholesale and retail energy prices, the cost of fuel to operate the Conectiv Energy plants, and the cost of purchased energy necessary to meet its power supply obligations. In order to lower its financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations and provide a more predictable earnings stream, the Competitive Energy business frequently enters into contracts to hedge the power output of its generation facilities, the costs of fuel used to operate those facilities and its energy supply obligations. This hedging strategy is more fully discussed in Item 1. Business. Like the Power Delivery business, the Competitive Energy business is seasonal, and therefore weather patterns can have a material impact on operating results. The Other Non Regulated business has been conducted primarily through two subsidiaries of PHI: Potomac Capital Investment Corporation ("PCI") manages an existing portfolio of financial investments primarily consisting of energy leveraged leases. During the second quarter of 2003 PCI discontinued all new investment activities. Pepco Communications, Inc. ("Pepcom"), which in December 2004, sold its only asset, a 50% membership interest in Starpower Communications, LLC ("Starpower"), a joint venture with RCN Corporation (RCN), to RCN for $29 million in cash. 35 PHI does not plan to make further investments in its Other Non Regulated businesses, and will focus on maintaining the earnings stream from its energy leveraged leases. For a discussion of certain tax and accounting issues associated with PCIs leveraged lease portfolio, see "Regulatory and Other Matters," herein. BUSINESS STRATEGY PHIs business strategy has three primary components: Achieving stable earnings in the Power Delivery business by focusing on the delivery of energy in a cost effective manner, while maintaining a high level of service reliability and customer satisfaction. Supplementing PHIs utility earnings through complementary energy businesses that focus primarily on serving the competitive wholesale and retail markets in PJM. These businesses use conservative risk management practices to manage their commodity price and volume exposures. In addition, Conectiv Energy matches its portfolio of generation assets with its wholesale energy supply load. Strengthening PHIs credit profile through active debt reduction efforts. EARNINGS OVERVIEW Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Results PHIs net income for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $258.7 million, or $1.47 per share, compared to $113.5 million, or $0.66 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2003. 2004 net income included the charges and credits set forth below (which are presented net of tax and in millions of dollars). The segment that recognized the charge or credit also (or, if not attributable to a segment, Corporate and Other) is indicated. $(7.3) charge to reduce the book value of PHIs 50% Starpower investment to $28 million which was sold to RCN in December 2004 Other Non Regulated An aggregate of $13.2 in tax benefits related to issuance of a local jurisdictions final consolidated tax return regulations, which were retroactive to 2001. Effect by segment is: Power Delivery $ 0.8 Pepco Energy Services 1.5 Other Non Regulated 8.8 Corporate & Other 2.1 PHI Consolidated $13.2 $6.6 gain on disposition associated with Vineland Cogeneration facility Conectiv Energy $(7.7) impact of expenses associated with the prepayment of the Bethlehem debt Conectiv Energy $8.6 gain on the disposition of Vineland distribution assets Power Delivery 36 $(19.7) charge resulting from a tax settlement with the IRS related to PCIs non lease financial assets Other Non Regulated An aggregate of $(7.7) in severance costs accruals. Effect by segment is: Power Delivery $(2.2) Conectiv Energy (0.5) Other Non Regulated (0.2) Corporate & Other (4.8) $(7.7) Net income for 2003 included the charges and credits set forth below (which are presented net of tax and in millions of dollars). The segment that recognized the charge and credit also is indicated. $(66.7) charge in the fourth quarter of 2003 to reduce the book value of PHIs 50% equity interest in Starpower Other Non Regulated $(26.6) unfavorable impact resulting from net trading losses prior to the cessation of proprietary trading Conectiv Energy Unfavorable impact related to the cancellation of a contract to purchase combustion turbines of $(64.1) at Conectiv Energy, offset by a $34.6 reversal of a purchase accounting fair value adjustment made on the date of the Pepco/Conectiv merger for Corporate and Other $(16.3) charge resulting from ACEs New Jersey deferral disallowance Power Delivery $5.9 credit resulting from a reversal of a reserve for stranded costs at ACE Power Delivery $(8.7) reserve recorded against a pre petition receivable from Mirant Power Delivery $(19.4) impairment of combustion turbine inventory at Conectiv Energy, offset by a $17.7 reversal of a purchase accounting fair value adjustment made on the date of Pepcos acquisition of Conectiv Corporate & Other $44.7 gain on the sale of Edison Place office building Other Non Regulated Excluding the items listed above, net income would have been $272.6 million in 2004 and net income in 2003 would have been $212.4 million. This increase in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to: higher earnings for Conectiv Energy from its merchant generation plants; higher earnings for Pepco Energy Services as a result of improved margins from its retail commodity business and higher earnings for Other Non Regulated due to sales of aircraft and lower interest expense. SEGMENT RESULTS Set forth below is a summary of the principal factors contributing to the earnings variances between the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to December 31, 2003 (net of tax and in millions of dollars): Power Delivery $26.5 of lower earnings primarily as a result of the TPA settlement with Mirant in October 2003 37 $16.9 of higher regulated T&D revenue as a result of 2% electric sales growth of $13.9 and more favorable summer weather of $3.0 $4.9 of lower depreciation and other taxes $2.7 of higher earnings related to lower interest expense, partially offset by higher operations and maintenance and other miscellaneous expenses Conectiv Energy $34.1 of higher merchant generation earnings, which resulted primarily from fuel switching, hedging and use of power plant flexibility $9.5 of higher earnings from Provider of Last Resort (POLR) services as a result of an increase in average sales prices and somewhat lower purchased power costs $14.5 lower earnings primarily due to lower capitalized interest and higher depreciation expense as a result of the completion of Bethlehem facility and higher effective tax rate Pepco Energy Services $8.5 increase in earnings primarily from its retail commodity business Other Non Regulated $5.4 of gains on the sale of PCIs last remaining aircraft leases $9.1 of primarily lower interest expense Corporate and Other $2.4 gain on the sale of a note receivable relating to a previous asset disposition $4.5 of lower amortization $3.1 of other positive miscellaneous items, including lower taxes CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The results of operations discussion below is for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. All amounts in the tables (except customers) include intercompany transactions and are in millions. Operating Revenue A detail of the components of PHIs consolidated operating revenue is as follows: 2004 2003 Change Power Delivery $4,375.9 $4,016.8 $359.1 Conectiv Energy 2,408.3 2,859.0 (450.7) Pepco Energy Services 1,168.6 1,126.2 42.4 Other Non Regulated 87.9 100.1 (12.2) Corporate and Other (818.9) (830.8) 11.9 Total Operating Revenue $7,221.8 $7,271.3 $(49.5) 38 Power Delivery Business The following table categorizes Power Deliverys operating revenue by type of revenue. 2004 2003 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $1,566.7 $1,521.0 $45.7 Default Supply Revenue 2,514.7 2,206.1 308.6 Other Electric Revenue 66.8 98.7 (31.9) Total Electric Operating Revenue 4,148.2 3,825.8 322.4 Regulated Gas Revenue 169.1 150.2 18.9 Other Gas Revenue 58.6 40.8 17.8 Total Gas Operating Revenue 227.7 191.0 36.7 Total Power Delivery Operating Revenue $4,375.9 $4,016.8 $359.1 Regulated Transmission and Distribution (T&D) Electric Revenue consists of revenue from the transmission of electricity and the delivery of electricity to its customers within PHIs service territories at regulated rates. Default Supply Revenue (DSR) also known, depending on the jurisdiction as Standard Offer Service (SOS), Basic Generation Service (BGS), and Provider of Last Resort (POLR) consists of revenue received from the supply of electricity within PHIs service territories at regulated rates pursuant to supply obligations. The costs related to the supply of electricity are included in Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales. Other Electric Revenue consists of utility related work and services performed on behalf of customers including other utilities. Regulated Gas Revenue consists of revenues from the transportation of natural gas and on system gas sales to customers within PHIs service territories at regulated rates. Other Gas Revenue consists of off system natural gas sales and the resale of excess natural gas or system capacity. Electric Operating Revenue Regulated T&D Electric Revenue 2004 2003 Change Residential $ 598.6 $ 576.2 $22.4 Commercial 715.2 674.7 40.5 Industrial 37.3 41.0 (3.7) Other PJM 215.6 229.1 (13.5) Total Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $1,566.7 $1,521.0 $45.7 Regulated T&D Electric Sales (KwH) 2004 2003 Change Residential 17,780 17,147 633 Commercial 28,440 27,648 792 Industrial 4,458 4,874 (416) Total Regulated T&D Electric Sales 50,678 49,669 1,009 39 Regulated T&D Electric Customers (000s) 2004 2003 Change Residential 1,567 1,547 20 Commercial 193 191 2 Industrial 2 2 Total Regulated T&D Electric Customers 1,762 1,740 22 The ACE, DPL, and Pepco service territories are located within the Washington, DC to southern New Jersey corridor. These service territories taken together are economically diverse and include key industries that contribute to the regional economic base and to PHIs growing T&D revenues. Commercial activity in the region includes banking and other professional services, casinos, government, insurance, real estate, strip mall, stand alone construction, and tourism. Industrial activity in the region includes automotive, chemical, glass, pharmaceutical, and steel manufacturing, food processing, and oil refining. Regulated T&D Electric Sales, as measured on a KwH basis, increased by 2% in 2004, driven by residential and commercial customer classes. Regulated T&D Revenue increased by $45.7 million primarily due to the following: (i) $14.4 million increase due to growth and average customer usage, (ii) $4.8 million increase due to higher average effective rates, (iii) $9.1 million favorable weather, (iv) $39.9 million increase in tax pass throughs, principally a county surcharge, (offset in Other Taxes). These increases were offset by (v) $20.5 million decrease primarily related to PJM network transmission revenue and the impact of customer choice and (vi) $2.1 million related to Delaware competitive transition charge that ended in 2003. Cooling degree days increased by 11.0% and heating degree days decreased by 6.3% for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to the same period in 2003. Default Supply Revenue 2004 2003 Change Residential $ 993.6 $ 875.2 $118.4 Commercial 1,069.3 946.4 122.9 Industrial 140.2 156.1 (15.9) Other (Includes PJM) 311.6 228.4 83.2 Total Default Supply Revenue $2,514.7 $2,206.1 $308.6 Default Supply Sales (KwH) 2004 2003 Change Residential 16,768 16,048 720 Commercial 19,338 18,134 1,204 Industrial 2,294 2,882 (588) Other 96 94 2 Total Default Supply Sales 38,496 37,158 1,338 40 Default Supply Customers (000s) 2004 2003 Change Residential 1,510 1,460 50 Commercial 180 175 5 Industrial 2 2 Other 1 1 Total Default Supply Customers 1,693 1,638 55 Default Supply Revenue increased $308.6 million primarily due to the following: (i) $109.2 million as the result of higher retail energy rates, the result of effective rate increases in Delaware beginning October 2003 and in Maryland beginning in June and July 2004, (ii) $92.3 million primarily due to a reduction in customer migration in DC, (iii) $83.1 million increase in wholesale energy prices as the result of higher market prices in 2004, and (iv) $24.4 million increase in average customer usage. Other Electric Revenue decreased $31.9 million primarily due to a $43.0 million decrease that resulted from the expiration on December 31, 2003 of a contract to supply electricity to Delaware Municipal Electric Corporation (DMEC). This decrease was partially offset by a $14.0 million increase in customer requested work (related costs in Operations and Maintenance). Gas Operating Revenue Regulated Gas Revenue 2004 2003 Change Residential $100.0 $ 88.8 $11.2 Commercial 56.4 47.7 8.7 Industrial 8.1 9.2 (1.1) Transportation and Other 4.6 4.5 .1 Total Regulated Gas Revenue $169.1 $150.2 $18.9 Regulated Gas Sales (Mcf) 2004 2003 Change Residential 8.7 9.0 (.3) Commercial 5.5 5.5 Industrial 1.2 1.6 (.4) Transportation and Other 6.2 6.8 (.6) Total Regulated Gas Sales 21.6 22.9 (1.3) Regulated Gas Customers (000s) 2004 2003 Change Residential 108.9 107.6 1.3 Commercial 9.1 9.1 Industrial Transportation and Other .1 .1 Total Regulated Gas Customers 118.1 116.8 1.3 DPLs natural gas service territory is located in New Castle County, Delaware. Several key industries contribute to the economic base as well as to growth. 41 Commercial activity in the region includes banking and other professional services, casinos, government, insurance, real estate, strip mall, stand alone construction, and tourism. Industrial activity in the region includes automotive, chemical, and pharmaceutical. Regulated Gas Revenue increased $18.9 million principally due to the following: (i) $21.0 million increase in the Gas Cost Rate due to higher natural gas commodity costs; this was effective November 1, 2003, (ii) $8.2 million increase in Gas Base Rates due to higher operating expenses and cost of capital; this was effective December 9, 2003, and (iii) $2.0 million true up adjustment to unbilled revenues in 2003. These increases were partially offset by (iv) $9.4 million decrease due to 2003 being significantly colder than normal and (v) $2.9 million reduction related to lower industrial sales. Heating degree days decreased 7.1% for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to the same period in 2003. Other Gas Revenue increased $17.8 million largely related to an increase in off system sales revenues of $17.3 million. The gas sold off system was made available by warmer winter weather and reduced customer demand. Competitive Energy Business The following table categorizes the Competitive Energy business operating revenue into major profit centers. 2004 2003 Change Merchant Generation $ 684.5 $ 540.2 $ 144.3 POLR Load Service 695.3 972.2 (276.9) Power, Oil & Gas Marketing Services and Other 1,028.5 1,346.6 (318.1) Total Conectiv Energy Operating Revenue $2,408.3 $2,859.0 $(450.7) Pepco Energy Services $1,168.6 $1,126.2 $ 42.4 Merchant Generation experienced an increase of $144.3 million, primarily due to $166.6 million from increased opportunities to take advantage of unit operating flexibility and increased power prices (approximately 11% higher). This increase was partially offset by $22.3 million from the implementation of EITF 03 11 on January 1, 2004. EITF 03 11 resulted in operating revenues and operating expenses related to certain energy contracts being reported on a net basis. POLR Load Service experienced a decrease of $276.9 million primarily due to a $152.9 million decrease in revenue from PJM due primarily to a change in power scheduling procedures by Conectiv to schedule power directly to DPL and a decrease of $187.9 million that related to the implementation of EITF 03 11 on January 1, 2004. This decrease was partially offset by increased hedging activity, including the recognition of an adjustment related to fuel supply contracts of $5.6 million. Power, Oil and Gas Marketing Services and Other decreased by $318.1 million primarily due to the expiration in 2003 of some large New Jersey Basic Generation Service contracts. 42 The increase in Pepco Energy Services operating revenue of $42.4 million resulted from higher volumes of electricity sold to customers in 2004 at more favorable prices than in 2003, partially offset by a decrease in natural gas revenues. Operating Expenses Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales A detail of PHIs consolidated fuel and purchased energy and other services cost of sales is as follows: 2004 2003 Change Power Delivery $2,523.8 $2,294.7 $229.1 Conectiv Energy 2,130.2 2,695.6 (565.4) Pepco Energy Services 1,064.4 1,033.1 31.3 Other Non Regulated Corporate and Other (821.8) (820.8) (1.0) Total $4,896.6 $5,202.6 $(306.0) Power Deliverys Fuel and Purchased Energy costs increased by $229.1 million primarily due to the following: (i) a $212.9 million increase related to higher average energy costs, the result of new Default Supply rates for Maryland beginning in June and July 2004 and for New Jersey beginning in June 2004 and less customer migration primarily in DC, (ii) $45.1 million higher costs due to the increased cost of electricity supply under the TPA Settlement with Mirant, effective October 2003, and (iii) a $30.2 million increase for gas commodity purchases, partially offset by (i) $43.0 million related to the DMEC 2003 contract expiration, and (ii) $14.5 million reserve recorded in September 2003 to reflect a potential exposure related to a pre petition receivable from Mirant Corp. for which Pepco filed a creditors claim in the bankruptcy proceedings. The following table categorizes the Competitive Energy business fuel and purchased energy and other services cost of sales into major profit centers. 2004 2003 Change Merchant Generation $ 443.6 $ 356.0 $ 87.6 POLR Load Service 682.6 975.3 (292.7) Power, Oil & Gas Marketing Services and Other 1,004.0 1,364.3 (360.3) Total Conectiv Energy Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales $2,130.2 $2,695.6 $(565.4) Pepco Energy Services $1,064.4 $1,033.1 $ 31.3 The decrease of $565.4 million in Conectiv Energys fuel, purchased energy and other services cost of sales is broken down as follows: Merchant Generation increased by $87.6 million mainly due to an increase of $109.9 million primarily due to higher fuel costs (approximately 7% higher). This increase was partially offset by a $22.3 million decrease from the implementation of EITF 03 11 on January 1, 2004. 43 POLR Load Service decreased by $292.7 million partially due to a change in power scheduling procedures by Conectiv at PJM resulting in a $154.3 million decrease and a decrease of approximately $187.9 million that related to the implementation of EITF 03 11 on January 1, 2004. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in hedging activity. Power, Oil and Gas Marketing Services and Other decreased by $360.3 million due to the expiration of some large New Jersey Basic Generation Service contracts in 2003. The increase in Pepco Energy Services fuel and purchased energy and other services cost of sales of $31.3 million resulted from higher volumes of electricity purchased in 2004 to serve customers, partially offset by a decrease in volumes of natural gas purchased in 2004 to serve customers. Other Operation and Maintenance PHIs other operation and maintenance increased by $32.1 million to $799.9 million in 2004 from $767.8 million in 2003 primarily due to (i) $12.1 million of customer requested work (offset in Other Electric Revenue), (ii) $10.6 million higher electric system operation and maintenance costs, (iii) $9.4 million in Sarbanes Oxley external compliance costs, (iv) $12.8 million severance costs, partially offset by $10.6 million incremental storm costs primarily related to one time charges as a result of Hurricane Isabel in September 2003. Depreciation and Amortization PHIs depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $18.4 million to $440.5 million in 2004 from $422.1 million in 2003 primarily due to a $17.0 million increase attributable to the Power Delivery business resulting from (i) a $12.8 million increase for amortization of New Jersey bondable transition property as a result of additional transitional bonds issued in December 2003; (ii) $3.8 million for the amortization of the New Jersey deferred service costs balance which began in August 2003; and (iii) a $2.4 increase for amortization of a regulatory tax asset related to New Jersey stranded costs. Additionally, depreciation expense attributable to the Competitive Energy business increased by $5.9 million from 2003 due to a full year of depreciation expense during 2004 at Conectiv Energys Bethlehem facility. Other Taxes Other taxes increased by $28.9 million to $302.8 million in 2004 from $273.9 million in 2003. This increase primarily resulted from a $30.1 million increase attributable to the Power Delivery business due to pass throughs of $33.9 million higher county surcharge and $3.6 million higher gross receipts/delivery taxes (offset in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue), partially offset by $9.5 million lower property tax expense due to true ups recorded in 2004. Deferred Electric Service Costs Deferred Electric Service Costs (DESC), which relates only to ACE, increased by $43.3 million to $36.3 million in 2004 from a $7.0 million operating expense credit in 2003. At December 31, 2004, DESC represents the net expense or over recovery associated with New Jersey NUGs, MTC and other restructuring items. A key driver of the $43.3 million change was $27.5 million for the New Jersey deferral disallowance from 2003. ACEs rates for 44 the recovery of these costs are reset annually and the rates will vary year to year. On ACEs balance sheet a regulatory asset includes an under recovery of $99.4 million as of December 31, 2004. This amount is net of a $46.1 million write off on previously disallowed items under appeal. Impairment Losses The impairment losses recorded by PHI in 2003 consist of an impairment charge of $53.3 million from the cancellation of a CT contract and an $11.0 million aircraft impairment. Gain on Sale of Assets During 2004 PHI recorded $30.0 million in pre tax gains on the sale of assets compared to a $68.8 million pre tax gain in 2003. The 2004 pre tax gains primarily consist of (i) a $14.7 million pre tax gain from the condemnation settlement with the City of Vineland relating to the ACE transfer of distribution assets and customer accounts, (ii) an $8.3 million pre tax gain on the sale of aircraft by PCI, and (iii) a $6.6 million pre tax gain on the sale of land. The $68.8 million pre tax gain in 2003 represents the gain on the sale of PHIs office building which was owned by PCI. Other Income (Expenses) PHIs other expense (which is net of other income) decreased $88.0 million to $341.0 million in 2004, from $429.0 million in 2003. The decrease was primarily due to a pre tax impairment charge of $102.6 million related to PHIs investment in Starpower that was recorded during 2003, compared to an additional pre tax impairment charge of $11.2 million that was recorded during the second quarter of 2004. Preferred Stock Dividend Requirements of Subsidiaries Preferred Stock Dividend Requirements decreased by $11.1 million to $2.8 million in 2004 from $13.9 million in 2003. Of this decrease, $6.9 million was attributable to SFAS No. 150, which requires that dividends on Mandatorily Redeemable Serial Preferred Stock declared subsequent to July 1, 2003 be recorded as interest expense. An additional $4.6 million of the decrease resulted from lower dividends in 2004 due to the redemption of the Trust Originated Preferred Securities in 2003. Income Tax Expense Pepco Holdings effective tax rate for 2004 was 40% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference were state income taxes (net of federal benefit), the flow through of certain book tax depreciation differences and the settlement with the IRS on certain non lease financial assets (which is the primary reason for the higher effective tax rate as compared to 2003), partially offset by the flow through of Deferred Investment Tax Credits and tax benefits related to certain leveraged leases and the benefit associated with the retroactive adjustment for the issuance of final consolidated tax return regulations by a taxing authority. Pepco Holdings effective tax rate for 2003 was 37% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference were state income taxes (net of federal benefit) and the flow through of certain book tax depreciation differences, partially offset by the flow through of Deferred Investment Tax Credits and tax benefits related to certain leveraged leases. 45 The results of operations discussion below is for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. Revised Segment Presentation In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131, results for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 have been revised to conform to the 2004 segment presentation. This was required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 131 "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information," because Pepco Holdings management identified its operating segments at January 1, 2004 as Power Delivery, Conectiv Energy, Pepco Energy Services, and Other Non Regulated. Prior to January 1, 2004, Pepco Holdings Power Delivery business consisted of two operating segments, Pepco and Conectiv Power Delivery. However, with the continued integration of the Power Delivery businesses, effective January 1, 2004 these two businesses represented a single operating segment. Additionally, effective January 1, 2004, PHI transferred several operating businesses from one operating segment to another in order to better align their operations going forward. Lack of Comparability of 2003 and 2002 Operating Results The accompanying results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 include Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries results for the full year. Because of merger accounting that was used to record Pepcos acquisition of Conectiv, the results of operations for 2002 include the results of Pepco and its pre merger subsidiaries (PCI and Pepco Energy Services) for the entire year consolidated with the results of Conectiv and its subsidiaries starting on August 1, 2002, the date the merger was completed. Accordingly, the results of operations for 2003 and 2002 are not comparable. Operating Revenue PHIs operating revenue increased by $2,946.8 million to $7,271.3 million in 2003, from $4,324.5 million in 2002. This increase was primarily due to an increase in operating revenue of $1,497.2 million at Power Delivery, an increase of $1,645.7 million at Conectiv Energy, and an increase of $260.5 million at Pepco Energy Services. Intercompany revenues that are eliminated in consolidation are included as part of business segment operating revenues. The $1,497.2 million increase in Power Deliverys operating revenue for 2003 primarily resulted from the fact that PHI recognized $2,489.7 million in revenue from Conectiv Power Delivery in 2003 (full year) vs. $997.4 million during 2002 (post August 1, 2002 merger date operations), an increase of $1,492.3 million. Additionally, Pepcos operating revenues increased by $14.1 million in 2003. The $14.1 million increase in Pepcos operating revenue in 2003 resulted from the following: Delivery revenue increased by $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase results from a $19.2 million increase from a fuel tax pass through, partially offset by $.7 million decrease in Delivery revenue (revenue Pepco receives for delivering energy to its customers). The $.7 million decrease results from a .6% decrease in delivered kilowatt hour sales. 46 Standard offer service (SOS) revenue (revenue Pepco receives for the procurement of energy by Pepco for its SOS customers) increased by $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 due to colder winter weather as heating degree days increased by 12.2%, offset by milder summer weather as cooling degree days decreased by 30.2%. Pepcos retail access to a competitive market for generation services was made available to all Maryland customers on July 1, 2000 and to D.C. customers on January 1, 2001. As of December 31, 2003, 14% of Pepcos Maryland customers and 11% of its D.C. customers had chosen alternate suppliers. These customers accounted for 912 megawatts of load in Maryland (of Pepcos total load of 3,439) and 970 megawatts of load in D.C. (of Pepcos total load of 2,269). As of December 31, 2002, 16% of Pepcos Maryland customers and 13% of its D.C. customers had chosen alternate suppliers. These customers accounted for 1,175 megawatts of load in Maryland (of Pepcos total load of 3,369) and 1,140 megawatts of load in D.C. (of Pepcos total load of 2,326). Pepcos other revenue decreased $8.6 million primarily due to lower capacity (megawatts) available to sell, lower capacity market rates and restructuring in the PJM market. The $1,645.7 million increase in Conectiv Energys operating revenue during 2003 resulted from the fact that PHI recognized $2,859.0 million in revenue in 2003 (full year) vs. $1,213.3 million during 2002 (post August 1, 2002 merger date operations). The increase in Pepco Energy Services operating revenue during 2003 of $260.5 million was primarily due to growth in its commodity business from sales of electricity and natural gas due to higher volumes which resulted from more commercial and industrial customers being served and higher prices due to wholesale commodity market conditions. In 2003, wholesale and retail megawatt hour sales increased by approximately 16% and wholesale and retail dekatherm sales increased by approximately 19%. Operating Expenses Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales PHIs fuel and purchased energy and other services cost of sales increased by $2,400.8 million to $5,202.6 million in 2003 from $2,801.8 million in 2002. This increase was primarily due to an increase in Power Delivery of $1,005.8 million, an increase in Conectiv Energy of $1,598.4 million, and an increase in Pepco Energy Services of $255.1 million. Intercompany fuel purchases that are eliminated in consolidation are included in business segment fuel purchases. The $1,005.8 million increase in Power Deliverys fuel and purchased energy and other services cost of sales for 2003 primarily resulted from the fact that PHI recognized $1,610.5 million in fuel and purchased energy and other services cost of sales from Conectiv Power Delivery in 2003 (full year) vs. $641.2 million during 2002 (post August 1, 2002 merger date operations), an increase of $969.3 million. Additionally, Pepcos fuel and purchased energy increased by $29.8 million in 2003. The $29.8 million increase in Pepcos fuel and purchased energy in 2003 resulted from the recording of a $14.5 million reserve to reflect a potential exposure related to a pre petition receivable from Mirant Corp., for which Pepco filed a creditors claim in bankruptcy proceedings and from $15.3 million from higher SOS costs. 47 The $1,598.4 million increase in Conectiv Energys fuel and purchased energy and other services cost of sales for 2003 primarily resulted from the fact that PHI recognized $2,695.6 million in fuel and purchased energy and other services cost of sales from Conectiv Energy in 2003 (full year) vs. $1,097.2 million during 2002 (post August 1, 2002 merger date operations), an increase of $1,598.4 million. The increase in Pepco Energy Services fuel and purchased energy and other services cost of sales during 2003 of $255.1 million primarily resulted from growth in its retail commodity business for sales of electricity and natural gas due to higher volumes which resulted from more commercial and industrial customers being served and higher prices due to wholesale commodity market conditions. Other Operation and Maintenance PHIs other operation and maintenance increased by $243.9 million to $767.8 million in 2003 from $523.9 million in 2002. This increase was primarily due to an increase in Power Delivery of $212.7 million and an increase in Conectiv Energy of $55.4 million. The $212.7 million increase in Power Deliverys other operation and maintenance for 2003 primarily resulted from the fact that PHI recognized $394.9 million in other operation and maintenance from Conectiv Power Delivery in 2003 (full year) vs. $146.3 million during 2002 (post August 1, 2002 merger date operations), an increase of $248.6 million. Depreciation and Amortization PHIs depreciation and amortization increased by $182.3 million to $422.1 million in 2003 from $239.8 million in 2002. This increase was primarily due to an increase in Power Delivery of $147.0 million and an increase in Conectiv Energy of $26.8 million. The $147.0 million increase in Power Deliverys depreciation and amortization for 2003 primarily resulted from the fact that PHI recognized $186.2 million in depreciation and amortization from Conectiv Power Delivery in 2003 (full year) vs. $62.8 million during 2002 (post August 1, 2002 merger date operations), an increase of $123.4 million. Additionally, Pepcos depreciation and amortization increased by $23.2 million in 2003 due to software amortization. Other Taxes PHIs other taxes increased by $48.3 million to $273.9 million in 2003 from $225.6 million in 2002. This increase was primarily due to an increase in Power Delivery of $44.4 million. The $44.4 million increase in Power Deliverys other taxes for 2003 primarily resulted from the fact that PHI recognized $59.7 million in other taxes from Conectiv Power Delivery in 2003 (full year) vs. $24.8 million during 2002 (post August 1, 2002 merger date operations), an increase of $34.9 million. Additionally, Pepcos other taxes increased by $9.1 million in 2003 due to higher fuel taxes. Deferred Electric Service Costs PHIs deferred electric service costs increased by $5.2 million in 2003 due to the net under recovery associated with New Jersey NUGs, MTC and other restructuring items. 48 Impairment Losses The $64.3 million in impairment losses in 2003 consists of charges of $53.3 million for Conectiv Energy CT contract cancellation and write downs and $11.0 million related to a PCI aircraft write down. Gain on Sale of Assets The $68.8 million gain on sale of assets is recorded net against operating expenses and represents the gain on the sale of PHIs office building in 2003 which was owned by PCI. Other Income (Expenses) PHIs other expenses increased by $238.6 million to $429.0 million in 2003 from $190.4 million in 2002. This increase was primarily due to an increase in other expenses of $57.6 million recognized at Power Delivery, an increase of $99.7 million in Other Non Regulated, and an increase of $65.0 million in Corporate and Other. The $57.6 million increase in Power Deliverys other expenses for 2003 primarily resulted from the fact that PHI recognized $82.4 million in expenses from Conectiv Power Delivery in 2003 (full year) vs. $38.1 million in 2002 (post August 1, 2002 merger date operations), an increase of $44.3 million. The $99.7 million increase in Other Non Regulated operating expense for the year ended 2003 primarily includes an impairment charge of $102.6 million ($66.7 million after tax) related to PHIs investment in Starpower. Because of the distressed telecommunications market and the changed expectations of Starpowers future performance, PHI determined that its investment in Starpower was impaired at December 31, 2003. "Corporate and other" in 2003 primarily represents unallocated PHI capital costs, incurred as a result of long term acquisition financing entered into in late 2002. Income Tax Expense Pepco Holdings effective tax rates in 2003 and 2002 were 37% compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference are state income taxes (net of federal benefit) and the flow through of certain book tax depreciation differences partially offset by the flow through of Deferred Investment Tax Credits and the tax benefits related to certain leveraged leases. Extraordinary Item In July 2003, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) approved the determination of stranded costs related to ACEs January 31, 2003, petition relating to its B.L. England generating facility. The NJBPU approved recovery of $149.5 million. As a result of the order, ACE reversed $10.0 million of accruals for the possible disallowances related to these stranded costs. The credit to income of $5.9 million is classified as an extraordinary gain in Pepco Holdings financial statements, since the original accrual was part of an extraordinary charge in conjunction with the accounting for competitive restructuring in 1999. 49 CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY This section discusses Pepco Holdings capital structure, cash flow activity, capital spending plans and other uses and sources of capital for 2004 and 2003. Capital Structure The components of Pepco Holdings capital structure, expressed as a percentage of total capitalization (including short term debt and current maturities of long term debt but excluding transition bonds issued by Atlantic City Electric Transition Funding LLC (ACE Funding) and PES project funding secured by customer accounts receivable) is shown below as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. The debt issued by ACE Funding and Pepco Energy Services project funding, which are both effectively securitized, are excluded because the major credit rating agencies treat effectively securitized debt separately and not as general obligations of the Company, when computing credit quality measures.

(b) Represents debentures issued to financing trusts and current portion of debentures issued to financing trusts. (c) Includes first mortgage bonds, medium term notes, other long term debt (other than debt issued by ACE Funding and Pepco Energy Services project funding), current maturities of long term debt (other than debt issued by ACE Funding and Pepco Energy Services project funding), and Variable Rate Demand Bonds. Excludes capital lease obligations, transition bonds issued by ACE Funding, and Pepco Energy Services project funding secured by customer accounts receivable. (d) Excludes current maturities of long term debt, capital lease obligations due within one year, and Variable Rate Demand Bonds. In 2003, PHI established a goal of reducing its total debt and preferred stock outstanding by $1 billion by the end of 2007 to improve PHIs interest coverage ratios and achieve a ratio of consolidated equity to total capital (excluding Transition Bonds issued by ACE Funding and Pepco Energy Services project funding) in the mid 40% range. The debt reduction goal is expected to be met through a combination of internally generated cash, equity issuances through its Shareholder Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP), and asset dispositions. In 2004, PHI reduced its debt and preferred stock outstanding by approximately $480 million through a combination of cash flow from operating activities, less investing activities and dividends (approximately $134 million), proceeds from the issuance of PHI common stock, including the DRP, net of issuance costs (approximately $308 million), and reduction in cash and cash equivalents, net of other financing costs (approximately $38 million). 50 In 2003, PHI reduced its debt and preferred stock outstanding by approximately $250 million through a combination of cash flow from operating activities, less investing activities and dividends (approximately $231 million), proceeds from the issuance of common stock, primarily through the DRP, net of issuance costs (approximately $33 million), and less the increase in cash and cash equivalents net of other financing costs (approximately $14 million). Because the $278 million public offering of PHI common stock in 2004 was not contemplated in the original $1 billion of debt reduction plan, PHI has raised its debt reduction goal to $1.3 billion by 2007. (See Risk Factors for a description of factors that could cause PHI to not meet this goal.) Set forth below is a summary of long term financing activity during 2004 for Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries. Pepco Holdings issued 1,471,936 shares of common stock under its Shareholder Dividend Reinvestment Plan and various benefit plans. The proceeds from the issuances were added to PHIs general funds. Pepco Holdings sold 14,950,000 shares of common stock at $19.25 per share. The proceeds, in combination with short term debt, were used to pre pay in its entirety a term loan in the amount of $335 million of Conectiv Bethlehem, LLC. Pepco issued $275 million of secured senior notes with maturities of 10 and 30 years. Proceeds of $272.8 million were used to redeem higher interest rate securities of $210 million and to repay short term debt of $56.6 million. Pepco borrowed $100 million under a bank loan due in 2006. Proceeds were used to redeem mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of $42.5 million and to repay short term debt. DPL issued $100 million of unsecured notes that mature in 2014. Proceeds of $98.9 million were used to redeem trust preferred securities of $70 million and to repay short term debt. ACE issued $54.7 million of insured auction rate tax exempt securities and $120 million of secured senior notes which mature in 2029 and 2034 respectively. Proceeds of $173.2 million were used to redeem higher interest rate securities. Working Capital At December 31, 2004, Pepco Holdings current assets on a consolidated basis totaled $1.7 billion and its current liabilities totaled $1.9 billion. At December 31, 2003, PHIs current assets totaled $1.7 billion and its current liabilities totaled $2.2 billion. PHIs working capital deficit results in large part from the fact that, in the normal course of business, PHIs utility subsidiaries acquire energy supplies for their customers before the supplies are delivered to, metered and then billed to customers. Short term financings are used to meet liquidity needs. Short term financings are also used, at times, to temporarily fund redemptions of long term debt, until long term replacement issues are completed. 51 A detail of PHIs short term debt balance is as follows: As of December 31, 2004 ($ in Millions) Type PHI Parent Pepco DPL ACE ACE Funding Conectiv Energy PES PCI Conectiv PHI Consolidated Variable Rate Demand Bonds $ $ $104.8 $22.6 $ $ $31.0 $ $ $158.4 Current Portion of Long Term Debt 100.0 2.7 40.0 28.1 .1 60.0 280.0 510.9 Project Funding Secured by Accounts Receivable 5.4 5.4 Floating Rate Note 50.0 50.0 Commercial Paper 78.6 32.7 111.3 Total $128.6 $100.0 $107.5 $95.3 $28.1 $ $36.5 $60.0 $280.0 $836.0 As of December 31, 2003 ($ in Millions) Type PHI Parent Pepco DPL ACE ACE Funding Conectiv Energy PES PCI Conectiv PHI Consolidated Variable Rate Demand Bonds $ $ $104.8 $22.6 $ $ $ 31.0 $ $ $158.4 Current Portion of Long Term Debt 200.0 7.0 11.0 25.9 86.0 50.0 379.9 Project Funding Secured by Accounts Receivable 5.0 5.0 Construction Loan 310.0 310.0 Floating Rate Note 50.0 50.0 Commercial Paper Total $200.0 $50.0 $111.8 $33.6 $25.9 $310.0 $36.0 $86.0 $50.0 $903.3 Cash Flow Activity PHIs cash flows for 2004, 2003, and 2002 are summarized below. Cash Source / (Use) 2004 2003 2002 (Dollars in Millions) Operating Activities $734.6 $661.4 $ 793.1 Investing Activities (422.1) (254.8) (1,964.9) Financing Activities (373.5) (367.9) 718.1 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $(61.0) $ 38.7 $ (453.7) 52 Operating Activities Cash flows from operating activities are summarized below for 2004, 2003, and 2002. Cash Source / (Use) 2004 2003 2002 (Dollars in Millions) Net Income $258.7 $113.5 $210.5 Non cash adjustments to net income 495.2 685.5 472.4 Changes in working capital (19.3) (137.6) 110.2 Net cash provided by operating activities $734.6 $661.4 $793.1 Cash from operations is the primary source used to meet operating requirements and capital expenditures. Net cash flows provided by operating activities increased by $73.2 million to $734.6 million for 2004 from $661.4 million for 2003. The $73.2 million increase was largely the result of improved operating results at PHIs regulated utilities. Regulated T&D Electric experienced a 2% KwH growth rate in 2004, and regulated T&D Revenue increased by $45.7 million primarily due to customer growth and increased average usage, higher average effective rates, and favorable warmer weather. PHI Power Delivery produced over 85% of consolidated cash from operations in 2004 and 2003. In 2003, cash flows from operating activities decreased by $131.7 million to $661.4 million from $793.1 million for 2002. The $131.7 million decrease was due to higher interest payments in 2003 and a federal income tax refund in 2002. Investing Activities The most significant items included in cash flows from investing activities during 2004, 2003, and 2002 are summarized below. Cash Source / (Use) 2004 2003 2002 (Dollars in Millions) Acquisition of Conectiv $ $ $(1,075.6) Capital expenditures (517.4) (598.2) (503.8) Cash proceeds from sale of: Starpower investment 29.0 Marketable securities, net 19.4 156.6 (7.0) Office building and other properties 46.4 147.7 4.0 Purchase of leveraged leases (319.6) All other investing cash flows, net .5 39.1 (62.9) Net cash used by investing activities $(422.1) $(254.8) $(1,964.9) Capital expenditures decreased $80.8 million for 2004 to $517.4 million from $598.2 million for 2003. This decrease was primarily due to lower construction expenditures for Conectiv Energy, offset by an increase in Power Delivery capital requirements to upgrade electric transmission and distribution systems. 53 Capital expenditures increased $94.4 million for 2003 to $598.2 million from $503.8 million for 2002. This increase was primarily due to 2002 including five months of Conectiv companies as a result of the August 1, 2002 acquisition of Conectiv by Pepco. In 2002, net cash used by investing activities included the cash outflow of $1,075.6 million related to Pepcos acquisition of Conectiv. Excluding the impact of the Conectiv acquisition by Pepco and the investments in hydro electric facility leveraged leases, investing activities used a net cash flow of $569.7 million compared to $254.8 million in 2003 primarily due to PCIs liquidation of its marketable securities portfolio and the sale of its final real estate investment. PHI announced in the second quarter of 2003 the discontinuation of further investment activity by PCI. In December 2004, Pepcom sold its 50% interest in Starpower for $29 million in cash. Additionally in 2004 PHI received proceeds from the sale of aircraft and land. In September 2003 Potomac Capital Investment (PCI) sold an office building known as Edison Place (which serves as headquarters for PHI and Pepco). Financing Activities Cash Source / (Use) 2004 2003 2002 (Dollars in Millions) Common Stock Dividends $ (176.0) $(170.7) $ (130.6) Common Stock Issuances 318.0 32.8 118.1 Preferred Stock Redemptions (53.3) (197.5) (9.9) Long term Debt Issuances 650.4 1,136.9 1,981.7 Long term Debt Redemptions (1,214.7) (692.2) (415.2) Short term Debt, net 136.3 (452.7) (684.8) Other (34.2) (24.5) (141.2) Net cash (Used By) Provided By financing activities $ (373.5) $(367.9) $ 718.1 Common stock dividend payments were $176.0 million in 2004, $170.7 million in 2003, and $130.6 million in 2002. The increase in common dividends paid in 2004 was due to the issuance of 14,950,000 shares of common stock in September 2004 and issuances of 1,471,936 shares of common stock by the Companys Dividend Reinvestment Plan. The increase in 2003 was due to the August 1, 2002 acquisition of Conectiv by Pepco. In 2004, Pepco redeemed its remaining 900,000 shares of $3.40 series mandatorily redeemable preferred stock for $45 million, and 165,902 shares of $2.28 series preferred stock for $7.7 million. In 2003, redemptions of mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities included $125 million for Pepco, $70 million for DPL, and $95 million for ACE. In 2004, Pepco issued $275 million of secured senior notes with maturities of 10 and 30 years; proceeds were used to redeem higher interest rate securities and to repay short term debt. Pepco borrowed $100 million under a bank loan due in 2006, and proceeds were used to redeem mandatorily redeemable preferred stock and repay short term debt. DPL issued $100 million of unsecured notes that mature in 2014, and proceeds were used to redeem trust preferred securities and repay short term debt. ACE issued $54.7 million of insured auction rate tax exempt securities and $120 million 54 of secured senior notes which mature in 2029 and 2034 respectively; proceeds were used to redeem higher interest rate securities. In 2003, Pepco Holdings issued $700 million of unsecured long term debt with maturities ranging from 1 year to 7 years; proceeds were used to repay short term debt. Pepco issued $200 million of secured senior notes, and proceeds were used to refinance $125 million trust preferred securities and repay short term debt. DPL issued $33.2 million of tax exempt bonds having maturities ranging from 5 to 35 years, and proceeds were used to refinance higher interest debt. ACE Funding issued $152 million of Transition Bonds with maturities ranging from 8 to 17 years, and proceeds will be used to recover the stranded costs associated with an ACE generation asset and transaction costs. In December 2002, Pepco Holdings sold 5,750,000 shares of common stock at $19.13 per share. In September 2004, Pepco Holdings sold 14,950,000 shares of common stock at $19.25 per share. 3,808,135 shares of common stock have also been issued during the three year period pursuant to the Companys Dividend Reinvestment Program. In 2002, Pepco Holdings issued $1.35 billion of unsecured notes: $350 million of 5.50% notes due in 2007, $750 million of 6.45% notes due in 2012, and $250 million of 7.45% notes due 2032. The proceeds from the sale of these notes were used to repay approximately $1.1 billion of indebtedness outstanding in connection with the Merger, and to repay approximately $240 million of outstanding commercial paper, including $106.1 million of commercial paper issued to fund the settlement of treasury lock transactions. Also, Pepco Holdings issued an additional $150 million of 5.5% notes due 2007, the proceeds of which were used to repay outstanding commercial paper. In addition, pursuant to a Stranded Cost Rate Order issued by the NJBPU, ACE Funding issued $440 million Transition Bonds, the proceeds of which will be used to recover stranded costs. Capital Requirements Construction Expenditures Pepco Holdings construction expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2004 totaled $517.4 million of which $479.5 million was related to its power delivery businesses and the remainder related to Conectiv Energy and Pepco Energy Services. For the five year period 2005 through 2009, total construction expenditures are projected to be approximately $2.1 billion, of which approximately $2.0 billion is related to the Power Delivery business. This amount includes estimated costs for environmental compliance by PHIs subsidiaries. See Item 1 "Business Environmental Matters." Pepco Holdings expects to fund these expenditures through internally generated cash from the power delivery businesses. Dividends Pepco Holdings annual dividend rate on its common stock is determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration, among other factors, current and possible future developments that may affect PHIs income and cash flows. PHIs Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of 25 cents per share of common stock payable on March 31, 2004, June 30, 2004, September 30, 2004 and December 31, 2004. 55 On January 25, 2005, Pepco Holdings declared a dividend on common stock of 25 cents per share payable March 31, 2005, to shareholders of record March 10, 2005. Under PUHCA, PHI is prohibited, without SEC approval, from paying dividends on its common stock from capital or unearned surplus. PHI generates no operating income of its own. Accordingly, its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders depends on dividends received from its subsidiaries. In addition to their future financial performance, the ability of PHIs direct and indirect subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to limits imposed by: (i) state corporate and regulatory laws, which impose limitations on the funds that can be used to pay dividends and, in the case of regulatory laws, as applicable, may require the prior approval of the relevant utility regulatory commissions before dividends can be paid; (ii) PUHCA, which prohibits a subsidiary of a registered public utility holding company from paying a dividend out of capital or unearned surplus without the prior approval of the SEC; (iii) the prior rights of holders of existing and futu re preferred stock, mortgage bonds and other long term debt issued by the subsidiaries, and any other restrictions imposed in connection with the incurrence of liabilities, and (iv) certain provisions of the charters of Pepco, DPL and ACE, which impose restrictions on payment of common stock dividends for the benefit of preferred stockholders. Pepcos articles of incorporation and DPLs certificate and articles of incorporation each contains provisions restricting the amount of dividends that can be paid on common stock when preferred stock is outstanding if the applicable companys capitalization ratio is less than 25%. For this purpose, the capitalization ratio is equal to (i) common stock capital plus surplus, divided by (ii) total capital (including long term debt) plus surplus. In addition, DPLs certificate and articles of incorporation and ACEs certificate of incorporation each provides that if preferred stock is outstanding, no dividends may be paid on common stock if, after payment, the applicable companys common stock capital plus surplus would be less than the involuntary liquidation value of the outstanding preferred stock. Currently, none of these charter restrictions limits the ability of Pepco, DPL or ACE to pay dividends. Pension Funding Pepco Holdings has a noncontributory retirement plan (the Retirement Plan) that covers substantially all employees of Pepco, Conectiv and certain employees of other Pepco Holdings subsidiaries. Following the consummation of the acquisition of Conectiv by Pepco on August 1, 2002, the Pepco General Retirement Plan and the Conectiv Retirement Plan were merged into the Retirement Plan on December 31, 2002. The provisions and benefits of the merged Retirement Plan applicable to Pepco employees are identical to those in the original Pepco plan and the provisions and benefits applicable to Conectiv employees are identical to those in the original Conectiv plan. As of the 2004 valuation, the Retirement Plan satisfied the minimum funding requirements of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) without requiring any additional funding. However, PHIs funding policy with regard to the Retirement Plan is to maintain a funding level in excess of 100% of its accumulated benefit obligation (ABO). In 2004 and 2003, PHI made discretionary tax deductible cash contributions to the Retirement Plan in accordance with its funding policy. In 2004, the accumulated benefit obligation for the Retirement Plan increased over 2003, due to the accrual of an additional year of service for 56 participants and a decrease in the discount rate used to value the accumulated benefit obligation. The change in the discount rate reflected the continued decline in interest rates in 2004. The Retirement Plan assets achieved returns in 2004 in excess of the levels assumed in the valuation. As a result of the combination of these factors, in December 2004 PHI contributed $10 million (all of which was funded by Pepco) to the Retirement Plan. The contribution was made to ensure that under reasonable assumptions, the funding level at year end would be in excess of 100% of the accrued benefit obligation. In 2003, PHI contributed a total of $50 million (of which $30 million was funded by Pepco and $20 million was funded by ACE) to the Retirement Plan. Assuming no changes to the current pension plan assumptions, PHI projects no funding will be required under ERISA in 2005; however, PHI may elect to make a discretionary tax deductible contribution, if required to main tain its assets in excess of its ABO. Contractual Obligations And Commercial Commitments Summary information about Pepco Holdings consolidated contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2004, is as follows: Contractual Maturity Obligation Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years (Dollars in Millions) Short term debt $ 161.3 $161.3 $ $ $ Variable rate demand bonds 158.4 158.4 Long term debt 5,466.9 516.2 1,403.8 400.3 3,146.6 Interest payments on debt 2,898.7 294.8 511.0 378.4 1,714.5 Capital leases 230.1 15.9 31.3 30.6 152.3 Operating leases 578.5 38.2 76.4 78.0 385.9 Fuel and purchase power contracts (a) 7,220.8 1,343.9 1,761.1 725.4 3,390.4 Payments under interest rate swap agreements 25.4 6.0 13.1 6.3 Total $16,740.1 $2,534.7 $3,796.7 $1,619.0 $8,789.7 (a) Excludes the PPA Related Obligations that are part of the back to back agreement that was entered into with Mirant. Refer to the "Relationship with Mirant" section herein for additional information. Third Party Guarantees, Indemnifications and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Pepco Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries have various financial and performance guarantees and indemnification obligations which are entered into in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties as discussed below. As of December 31, 2004, Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries were parties to a variety of agreements pursuant to which they were guarantors for standby letters of credit, performance residual value, and other commitments and obligations. The fair value of these commitments and obligations was not required to be recorded in Pepco Holdings Consolidated Balance Sheets; however, certain energy marketing obligations of Conectiv Energy were recorded. The commitments and obligations, in millions of dollars, were as follows: 57 Guarantor PHI Conectiv PCI Total Energy marketing obligations of Conectiv Energy (1) $141.9 $ 1.6 $ $143.5 Energy procurement obligations of Pepco Energy Services (1) 7.8 7.8 Standby letters of credit of Pepco Holdings (2) 4.2 4.2 Guaranteed lease residual values (3) 0.6 6.2 6.8 Loan agreement (4) 13.1 13.1 Construction performance guarantees (5) 1.7 1.7 Other (6) 14.9 3.9 3.0 21.8 Total $182.5 $13.4 $3.0 $198.9 1. Pepco Holdings and Conectiv have contractual commitments for performance and related payments of Conectiv Energy and Pepco Energy Services to counterparties related to routine energy sales and procurement obligations, including requirements under BGS contracts for ACE. 2. Pepco Holdings has issued standby letters of credit of $4.2 million on behalf of subsidiary operations related to Conectiv Energys competitive energy activities and third party construction performance. These standby letters of credit were put into place in order to allow the subsidiaries the flexibility needed to conduct business with counterparties without having to post substantial cash collateral. While the exposure under these standby letters of credit is $4.2 million, Pepco Holdings does not expect to fund the full amount. 3. Subsidiaries of Pepco Holdings and Conectiv have guaranteed residual values in excess of fair value related to certain equipment and fleet vehicles held through lease agreements. As of December 31, 2004, obligations under the guarantees were approximately $6.8 million. Assets leased under agreements subject to residual value guarantees are typically for periods ranging from 2 years to 10 years. Historically, payments under the guarantee have not been made by the guarantor as, under normal conditions, the contract runs to full term at which time the residual value is minimal. As such, Pepco Holdings believes the likelihood of requiring payment under the guarantee is remote. 4. Pepco Holdings has issued a guarantee on behalf of a subsidiarys 50% unconsolidated investment in a limited liability company for repayment of borrowings under a loan agreement of approximately $13.1 million. 5. Conectiv has performance obligations of $1.7 million relating to obligations to third party suppliers of equipment. 6. Other guarantees comprise: Pepco Holdings has guaranteed payment of a bond issued by a subsidiary of $14.9 million. Pepco Holdings does not expect to fund the full amount of the exposure under the guarantee. Conectiv has guaranteed a subsidiary building lease of $3.9 million. PHI does not expect to fund the full amount of the exposure under the guarantee. PCI has guaranteed facility rental obligations related to contracts entered into by Starpower. As of December 31, 2004, the guarantees cover the remaining $3.0 million in rental obligations. 58 Pepco Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries have entered into various indemnification agreements related to purchase and sale agreements and other types of contractual agreements with vendors and other third parties. These indemnification agreements typically cover environmental, tax, litigation and other matters, as well as breaches of representations, warranties and covenants set forth in the agreements. Typically, claims may be made by third parties under these indemnification agreements over various periods of time depending on the nature of the claim. The maximum potential exposure under these indemnification agreements can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount depending on the nature of the claim and the particular transaction. The total maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements is not estimable due to several factors, including uncertainty as to whether or when claims may be made under these indemnities. Energy Contract Net Asset Activity The following table provides detail on changes in the competitive energy segments net asset or liability position with respect to energy commodity contracts from one period to the next: Roll forward of Mark to Market Energy Contract Net Assets For the Year Ended December 31, 2004 (Dollars are Pre Tax and in Millions) Proprietary Trading (1) Other Energy Commodity (2) Total Total Marked to market (MTM) Energy Contract Net Assets at December 31, 2003 $ 11.0 $60.6 $ 71.6 Total change in unrealized fair value excluding reclassification to realized at settlement of contracts (0.4) 32.4 32.0 Reclassification to realized at settlement of contracts (9.7) (45.5) (55.2) Effective portion of changes in fair value recorded in OCI (15.8) (15.8) Ineffective portion of changes in fair value recorded in earnings (6.0) (6.0) Changes in valuation techniques and assumptions Purchase/sale of existing contracts or portfolios subject to MTM Total MTM Energy Contract Net Assets at December 31, 2004 (a) $ 0.9 (3) $25.7 $ 26.6 (a) Detail of MTM Energy Contract Net Assets at December 31, 2004 (above) Total Current Assets (other current assets) $ 88.7 Noncurrent Assets (other assets) 15.1 Total MTM Energy Assets 103.8 Current Liabilities (other current liabilities) (54.6) Noncurrent Liabilities (other liabilities) (22.6) Total MTM Energy Contract Liabilities (77.2) Total MTM Energy Contract Net Assets $ 26.6 Notes: (1) Includes all remaining contracts held for proprietary trading.

Pricing is derived from the broker market. 60 Contractual Arrangements with Credit Rating Triggers or Margining Rights Under certain contractual arrangements entered into by PHIs subsidiaries in connection with competitive energy and other transactions, the affected company may be required to provide cash collateral or letters of credit as security for its contractual obligations if the credit ratings of the applicable company are downgraded one or more levels. In the event of a downgrade, the amount required to be posted would depend on the amount of the underlying contractual obligation existing at the time of the downgrade. As of December 31, 2004, a one level downgrade in the credit rating of PHI and all of its affected subsidiaries would have required PHI and such subsidiaries to provide aggregate cash collateral or letters of credit of approximately up to $135 million. An additional approximately $237 million of aggregate cash collateral or letters of credit would have been required in the event of subsequent downgrades to below investment grad e. PHI and its utility subsidiaries maintain adequate short term funding sources in the event the additional collateral or letters of credit are required. See "Sources of Capital Short Term Funding Sources." Many of the contractual arrangements entered into by PHIs subsidiaries in connection with competitive energy activities include margining rights pursuant to which the PHI subsidiary or a counterparty may request collateral if the market value of the contractual obligations reaches levels that are in excess of the credit thresholds established in the applicable arrangements. Pursuant to these margining rights, the affected PHI subsidiary may receive, or be required to post, collateral due to energy price movements. As of December 31, 2004, Pepco Holdings subsidiaries engaged in competitive energy activities were in receipt of (a net holder of) cash collateral in the amount of $22.6 million in connection with their competitive energy activities. Environmental Remediation Obligations PHIs accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2004 include approximately $25.7 million, of which $6.0 million is expected to be incurred in 2005, for potential cleanup and other costs related to sites at which an operating subsidiary is a PRP, is alleged to be a third party contributor, or has made a decision to clean up contamination on its own property. For information regarding projected expenditures for environmental control facilities, see "Business Environmental Matters." The principal environmental remediation obligations as of December 31, 2004, were: $7.6 million, of which $1.2 million is expected to be incurred in 2005, payable by DPL in accordance with a consent agreement reached with DNREC during 2001,for remediation, site restoration, natural resource damage compensatory projects and other costs associated with environmental contamination that resulted from an oil release at the Indian River power plant. That plant was sold on June 22, 2001. ACEs planned sale of the B.L. England and Deepwater generating facilities triggered the applicability of the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act requiring remediation at these facilities. When the prospective purchaser of these generating facilities terminated the agreement of sale in accordance with the agreements termination provisions, ACE decided to continue the environmental investigation process at these facilities. ACE and Conectiv Energy (to which ACE transferred the Deepwater generating facility on February 29, 2004) are continuing the investigation with oversight from NJDEP. ACE anticipates that it will incur costs of approximately $2.6 million in environmental remediation costs, of which $780,000 is expected to be 61 incurred in 2005, associated with the B.L. England generating facility. Conectiv Energy anticipates that it will incur approximately $6.5 million in environmental remediation costs, of which $810,000 is expected to be incurred in 2005, associated with the Deepwater generating facility. As a result of a December 7, 2003 oil spill at the B.L. England generating facility, $811,000 was accrued in December 2003 for estimated clean up, remediation, restoration, and potential NJDEP natural resources damage assessments. As of December 31, 2004, ACE has spent $582,000 for clean up, remediation, and restoration. The remaining liability of $229,000 is anticipated to cover future restoration efforts to be monitored for three years beginning in May 2004. The NJDEP natural resource damage assessments, if any, have not been determined at this time. DPL expects to incur costs of approximately $3.6 million in connection with the Wilmington Coal Gas Site to remediate residual material from the historical operation of a manufactured gas plant. Approximately $2.5 million is expected to be incurred in 2005. Pepco expects to incur approximately $2.1 million for long term monitoring in connection with Pepcos Swanson Creek oil release, of which $218,000 is expected to be incurred in 2005. Sources Of Capital Pepco Holdings sources to meet its long term funding needs, such as capital expenditures, dividends, and new investments, and its short term funding needs, such as working capital and the temporary funding of long term funding needs, include internally generated funds, securities issuances and bank financing under new or existing facilities. PHIs ability to generate funds from its operations and to access capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties. See "Risk Factors" for a discussion of important factors that may impact these sources of capital. Internally Generated Cash The primary source of Pepco Holdings internally generated funds is the cash flow generated by its regulated utility subsidiaries in the power delivery business. Additional sources of funds include cash flow generated from its non regulated subsidiaries and the sale of non core assets. Short Term Funding Sources Pepco Holdings and its regulated utility subsidiaries have traditionally used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs, such as commercial paper, short term notes and bank lines of credit. Proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs but may also be used to temporarily fund long term capital requirements. Pepco Holdings maintains an ongoing commercial paper program of up to $700 million. Pepco, DPL, and ACE have ongoing commercial paper programs of up to $300 million, up to $275 million, and up to $250 million, respectively. The commercial paper notes can be issued with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issue. 62 In July 2004, Pepco Holdings, Pepco, DPL and ACE entered into a five year credit agreement with an aggregate borrowing limit of $650 million. This agreement replaced a $550 million 364 day credit agreement that was entered into on July 29, 2003. The respective companies also are parties to a three year credit agreement that was entered into in July 2003 and terminates in July 2006 with an aggregate borrowing limit of $550 million. Pepco Holdings credit limit under these facilities is $700 million, and the credit limit of each of Pepco, DPL and ACE under these facilities is the lower of $300 million and the maximum amount of short term debt authorized by the appropriate state commission, except that the aggregate amount of credit utilized by Pepco, DPL and ACE at any given time under these facilities may not exceed $500 million. Funds borrowed under these facilities are available for general corporate purposes. Either credit facility also can be used as credit support for the commercial paper programs of the respective companies. The three year and five year credit agreements contain customary financial and other covenants that, if not satisfied, could result in the acceleration of repayment obligations under the agreements or restrict the ability of the companies to borrow under the agreements. Among these covenants is the requirement that each borrowing company maintain a ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization of 65% or less, computed in accordance with the terms of the credit agreements. As of December 31, 2004, the applicable ratios for Pepco Holdings, Pepco, DPL and ACE were 59.0%, 58.5%, 52.1% and 50.2%, respectively. The credit agreements also contain a number of customary events of default that could result in the acceleration of repayment obligations under the agreements, including (i) the failure of any borrowing company or any of its significant subsidiaries to pay when due, or the acceleration of, certain indebtedness under other borrowing arrangements, (ii) certain bankruptcy events, judgments or decrees against any borrowing company or its significant subsidiaries, and (iii) a change in control (as defined in the credit agreements) of Pepco Holdings or the failure of Pepco Holdings to own all of the voting stock of Pepco, DPL and ACE. In December 2004, PHI entered into a $50 million term loan due December 13, 2005 with a bank. The loan is variable rate, based on LIBOR. PHI has the option to select interest periods based on one, two, three or six month LIBOR rates. The covenants in the agreement are substantially consistent with those found in the three year and five year credit agreements. Proceeds from the loan were used to pay down commercial paper. Long Term Funding Sources The sources of long term funding for PHI and its subsidiaries are the issuance of debt and equity securities and borrowing under long term credit agreements. Proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements, such as capital expenditures and new investments, and to refund or refinance existing securities. PUHCA Restrictions Because Pepco Holdings is a public utility holding company registered under the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA), it must obtain SEC approval to issue securities. PUHCA also prohibits Pepco Holdings from borrowing from its subsidiaries. Under an SEC Financing Order dated July 31, 2002 (the Financing Order), Pepco Holdings is authorized to issue equity, preferred securities and debt securities in an aggregate amount not to exceed $3.5 billion through an authorization period ending June 30, 2005, subject to a ceiling on the effective cost of these funds. Pepco Holdings is also authorized to enter into guarantees to third parties or otherwise provide credit support with respect to obligations of its subsidiaries for up to $3.5 63 billion. Of this amount, only $1.75 billion may be on behalf of subsidiaries engaged in energy marketing activities. Pepco Holdings may issue common stock to satisfy its obligations under its Shareholder Dividend Reinvestment Plan and various employee benefit plans. Under the Financing Order, Pepco Holdings is limited to issuing no more than an aggregate of 20 million shares of common stock under its Shareholder Dividend Reinvestment Plan and employee benefit plans during the period ending June 30, 2005. The Financing Order requires that, in order to issue debt or equity securities, including commercial paper, Pepco Holdings must maintain a ratio of common stock equity to total capitalization (consisting of common stock, preferred stock, if any, long term debt and short term debt) of at least 30 percent. At December 31, 2004, Pepco Holdings common equity ratio for purposes of the Financing Order was 36.6 percent. The Financing Order also requires that all rated securities issued by Pepco Holdings be rated "investment grade" by at least one nationally recognized rating agency. Accordingly, if Pepco Holdings common equity ratio were less than 30 percent or if no nationally recognized rating agency rated a security investment grade, Pepco Holdings could not issue the security without first obtaining an amendment to the Financing Order from the SEC. If an amendment to the Financing Order is required to enable Pepco Holdings or any of its subsidiaries to effect a financing, there is no certainty that such an amendment could be obtained or as to the timing of SEC action. The failure to obtain timely relief from the SEC, in such circumstances, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries. The foregoing financing limitations also generally apply to Pepco, DPL, ACE and certain other Pepco Holdings subsidiaries. On February 15, 2005, PHI and its subsidiaries filed an application with the SEC for authorization to engage in various financing activities described therein for an authorization period through June 30, 2008. Money Pool Under the July 31, 2002 Financing Order, Pepco Holdings has received SEC authorization under PUHCA to establish the Pepco Holdings system money pool. The money pool is a cash management mechanism used by Pepco Holdings to manage the short term investment and borrowing requirements of the PHI subsidiaries that participate in the money pool. Pepco Holdings may invest in but not borrow from the money pool. Eligible subsidiaries with surplus cash may deposit those funds in the money pool. Deposits in the money pool are guaranteed by Pepco Holdings. Eligible subsidiaries with cash requirements may borrow from the money pool. Borrowings from the money pool are unsecured. Depositors in the money pool receive, and borrowers from the money pool pay, an interest rate based primarily on Pepco Holdings short term borrowing rate. Pepco Holdings deposits funds in the money pool to the extent that the pool has insufficient funds to meet the borrowin g needs of its participants, which may require Pepco Holdings to borrow funds for deposit from external sources. Consequently, Pepco Holdings external borrowing requirements fluctuate based on the amount of funds required to be deposited in the money pool. 64 REGULATORY AND OTHER MATTERS Relationship with Mirant Corporation In 2000, Pepco sold substantially all of its electricity generation assets to Mirant Corporation, formerly Southern Energy, Inc., pursuant to an Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement. As part of the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, Pepco entered into several ongoing contractual arrangements with Mirant and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, Mirant). On July 14, 2003, Mirant Corporation and most of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas (the Bankruptcy Court). Depending on the outcome of the matters discussed below, the Mirant bankruptcy could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of Pepco Holdings and Pepco. However, management currently believes that Pepco Holdings and Pepco currently have sufficient cash, cash flow and borrowing capacity under their credit facilities and in the capital markets to be able to satisfy any additional cash requirements that have arisen or may arise due to the Mirant bankruptcy. Accordingly, management does not anticipate that the Mirant bankruptcy will impair the ability of Pepco Holdings or Pepco to fulfill their contractual obligations or to fund projected capital expenditures. On this basis, management currently does not believe that the Mirant bankruptcy will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of either company. Transition Power Agreements As part of the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, Pepco and Mirant entered into Transition Power Agreements for Maryland and the District of Columbia, respectively (collectively, the TPAs). Under these agreements, Mirant was obligated to supply Pepco with all of the capacity and energy needed to fulfill its standard offer service obligations in Maryland through June 2004 and its standard offer service obligations in the District of Columbia through January 22, 2005. To avoid the potential rejection of the TPAs, Pepco and Mirant entered into an Amended Settlement Agreement and Release dated as of October 24, 2003 (the Settlement Agreement) pursuant to which Mirant assumed both of the TPAs and the terms of the TPAs were modified. The Settlement Agreement also provided that Pepco has an allowed, pre petition general unsecured claim against Mirant Corporation in the amount of $105 million (the Pepco TPA Claim). Pepco has also asserted the Pepco TPA Claim against other Mirant entities that Pepco believes are liable to Pepco under the terms of the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreements Assignment and Assumption Agreement (the Assignment Agreement). Under the Assignment Agreement, Pepco believes that each of the Mirant entities assumed and agreed to discharge certain liabilities and obligations of Pepco as defined in the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement. Mirant has filed objections to these claims. Under the current plan of reorganization filed by the Mirant entities with the Bankruptcy Court, certain Mirant entities other than Mirant Corporation would pay significantly higher portions of the claims of their creditors than would Mirant Corporation. The amount that Pepco will be able to recover from the Mirant bankruptcy estate with respect to the Pepco TPA Claim will depend on 65 the amount of assets available for distribution to creditors of the Mirant entities that are found to be liable for the Pepco TPA Claim. Power Purchase Agreements Under agreements with FirstEnergy Corp., formerly Ohio Edison (FirstEnergy), and Allegheny Energy, Inc., both entered into in 1987, Pepco is obligated to purchase from FirstEnergy 450 megawatts of capacity and energy annually through December 2005 (the FirstEnergy PPA). Under an agreement with Panda, entered into in 1991, Pepco is obligated to purchase from Panda 230 megawatts of capacity and energy annually through 2021 (the Panda PPA). In each case, the purchase price is substantially in excess of current market price. As a part of the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, Pepco entered into a "back to back" arrangement with Mirant. Under this arrangement, Mirant is obligated, among other things, to purchase from Pepco the capacity and energy that Pepco is obligated to purchase under the FirstEnergy PPA and the Panda PPA at a price equal to the price Pepco is obligated to pay under the FirstEnergy PPA and the Panda PPA (the PPA Related Oblig ations). Pepco Pre Petition Claims When Mirant filed its bankruptcy petition on July 14, 2003, Mirant had unpaid obligations to Pepco of approximately $29 million, consisting primarily of payments due to Pepco in respect of the PPA Related Obligations (the Mirant Pre Petition Obligations). The Mirant Pre Petition Obligations constitute part of the indebtedness for which Mirant is seeking relief in its bankruptcy proceeding. Pepco has filed Proofs of Claim in the Mirant bankruptcy proceeding in the amount of approximately $26 million to recover this indebtedness; however, the amount of Pepcos recovery, if any, is uncertain. The $3 million difference between Mirants unpaid obligation to Pepco and the $26 million Proofs of Claim primarily represents a TPA settlement adjustment which is included in the $105 million Proofs of Claim filed by Pepco against the Mirant debtors in respect of the Pepco TPA Claim. In view of this uncertainty, Pepco, in the third quarter of 2003, expen sed $14.5 million to establish a reserve against the $29 million receivable from Mirant. In January 2004, Pepco paid approximately $2.5 million to Panda in settlement of certain billing disputes under the Panda PPA that related to periods after the sale of Pepcos generation assets to Mirant. Pepco believes that under the terms of the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, Mirant is obligated to reimburse Pepco for the settlement payment. Accordingly, in the first quarter of 2004, Pepco increased the amount of the receivable due from Mirant by approximately $2.5 million and amended its Proofs of Claim to include this amount. Pepco currently estimates that the $14.5 million expensed in the third quarter of 2003 represents the portion of the entire $31.5 million receivable unlikely to be recovered in bankruptcy, and no additional reserve has been established for the $2.5 million increase in the receivable. The amount expensed represents Pepcos estimate of the possible outcome in bankruptcy, although the amou nt ultimately recovered could be higher or lower. Mirants Attempt to Reject the PPA Related Obligations On August 28, 2003, Mirant filed with the Bankruptcy Court a motion seeking authorization to reject its PPA Related Obligations. Upon motions filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas (the District Court) by Pepco and FERC, in October 2003, the District Court withdrew jurisdiction over the rejection proceedings from the Bankruptcy Court. In December 2003, the District Court denied Mirants motion to reject 66 the PPA Related Obligations on jurisdictional grounds. The District Courts decision was appealed by Mirant and The Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Mirant Corporation (the Creditors Committee) to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (the Court of Appeals). On August 4, 2004, the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the District Court saying that the District Court has jurisdiction to rule on the merits of Mirants rejection motion, suggesting that in doing so the court apply a "more rigorous standard" than the business judgment rule usually applied by bankruptcy courts in ruling on rejection motions. On December 9, 2004, the District Court issued an order again denying Mirants motion to reject the PPA Related Obligations. The District Court found that the PPA Related Obligations are not severable from the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement and that the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement cannot be rejected in part, as Mirant was seeking to do. On December 16, the Creditors Committee appealed the District Courts order to the Court of Appeals, and on December 20, 2004, Mirant also appealed the District Courts order. As more fully discussed below, Mirant had been making regular periodic payments in respect of the PPA Related Obligations. On December 9, 2004, Mirant filed a notice with the Bankruptcy Court that it was suspending payments to Pepco in respect of the PPA Related Obligations. On December 13, 2004, Mirant failed to make a payment of approximately $17.9 million due to Pepco for the period November 1, 2004 to November 30, 2004. Mirant failed to make that payment. On December 23, 2004, Pepco received a payment of approximately $6.8 million from Mirant, which according to Mirant represented the market value of the power for which payment was due on December 13. Mirant has informed Pepco that it intends to continue to pay the market value, but not the above market portion, of the power purchased under the PPA Related Obligations. Pepco disagrees with Mirants assertion that it need only pay the market value and believes that the amount repr esenting the market value calculated by Mirant is insufficient. On January 21, 2005, Mirant made a approximately $21.1 million, which, according to Mirant, includes the payment for the FirstEnergy PPA for December 2004 and "includes the December 2004 TPA revenue in the amount of $29,093,173.43, the TPA costs in the amount of $37,865,924.10, and an allocated share of [FirstEnergys] PPA bill credits/charges in the amount of $5,490,164.79." Pepco disputes Mirants contention that the amount paid reflects the full amount due Pepco under these agreements for the applicable periods. As of March 1, 2005, Mirant has withheld payment of approximately $34.8 million due to Pepco under the PPA Related Obligations. On January 21, 2005, Mirant filed in the Bankruptcy Court a motion seeking to reject certain of its ongoing obligations under the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, including the PPA Related Obligations. On March 1, 2005 (as amended by order dated March 7, 2005), the District Court granted Pepcos motion to withdraw jurisdiction over the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement rejection proceedings from the Bankruptcy Court. In addition, the District Court ordered Mirant to pay on March 18, 2005, all past due unpaid amounts under the PPA Related Obligations. Mirant has filed a motion for reconsideration and a stay of the March 1, 2005 order. 67 Pepco is exercising all available legal remedies and vigorously opposing Mirants attempt to reject the PPA Related Obligations and other obligations under the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement in order to protect the interests of its customers and shareholders. While Pepco believes that it has substantial legal bases to oppose the attempt to reject the agreements, the outcome of Mirants efforts to reject the PPA Related Obligations is uncertain. If Mirant ultimately is successful in rejecting the PPA Related Obligations, Pepco could be required to repay to Mirant, for the period beginning on the effective date of the rejection (which date could be prior to the date of the courts order and possibly as early as September 18, 2003) and ending on the date Mirant is entitled to cease its purchases of energy and capacity from Pepco, all amounts paid by Mirant to Pepco in respect of the PPA Related Obligations, less an amount equal to the price at which Mirant resold the purchased energy and capacity. Pepco estimates that the amount it could be required to repay to Mirant in the unlikely event that September 18, 2003, is determined to be the effective date of rejection, is approximately $133.2 million as of March 1, 2005 (assuming Mirant continues to withhold unpaid amounts of approximately $34.8 million as of March 1, 2005. Mirant has also indicated to the Bankruptcy Court that it will move to require Pepco to disgorge all amounts paid by Mirant to Pepco in respect of the PPA Related Obligations, less an amount equal to the price at which Mirant resold the purchased energy and capacity, for the period July 14, 2003 (the date on which Mirant filed its bankruptcy petition) through rejection, if approved, on the theory that Mirant did not receive value for those payments. Pepco estimates that the amount it would be required to repay to Mirant on the disgorgement theory, in addition to the amounts described above, is approximately $22.5 million. Any repayment by Pepco of amounts paid by Mirant would entitle Pepco to file a claim against the bankruptcy estate in an amount equal to the amount repaid. Pepco believes that, to the extent such amounts were not recovered from the Mirant bankruptcy estate, they would be recoverable as stranded costs from customers through distribution rates as described below. The following are estimates prepared by Pepco of its potential future exposure if Mirants attempt to reject the PPA Related Obligations ultimately is successful. These estimates are based in part on current market prices and forward price estimates for energy and capacity, and do not include financing costs, all of which could be subject to significant fluctuation. The estimates assume no recovery from the Mirant bankruptcy estate and no regulatory recovery, either of which would mitigate the effect of the estimated loss. Pepco does not consider it realistic to assume that there will be no such recoveries. Based on these assumptions, Pepco estimates that its pre tax exposure as of March 1, 2005, representing the loss of the future benefit of the PPA Related Obligations to Pepco, is as follows: If Pepco were required to purchase capacity and energy from FirstEnergy commencing as of March 1, 2005, at the rates provided in the PPA (with an average price per kilowatt hour of approximately 6.0 cents) and resold the capacity and energy at market rates projected, given the characteristics of the FirstEnergy PPA, to be approximately 5.0 cents per kilowatt hour, Pepco estimates that it would cost approximately $31 million for the remainder of 2005, the final year of the FirstEnergy PPA. 68 If Pepco were required to purchase capacity and energy from Panda commencing as of March 1, 2005, at the rates provided in the PPA (with an average price per kilowatt hour of approximately 16.9 cents), and resold the capacity and energy at market rates projected, given the characteristics of the Panda PPA, to be approximately 7.4 cents per kilowatt hour, Pepco estimates that it would cost approximately $29 million for the remainder of 2005, approximately $34 million in 2006 and 2007, and approximately $34 million to $49 million annually thereafter through the 2021 contract termination date. The ability of Pepco to recover from the Mirant bankruptcy estate in respect to the Mirant Pre Petition Obligations and damages if the PPA Related Obligations are successfully rejected will depend on whether Pepcos claims are allowed, the amount of assets available for distribution to the creditors of the Mirant companies determined to be liable for those claims, and Pepcos priority relative to other creditors. At the current stage of the bankruptcy proceeding, there is insufficient information to determine the amount, if any, that Pepco might be able to recover from the Mirant bankruptcy estate, whether the recovery would be in cash or another form of payment, or the timing of any recovery. If Mirant ultimately is successful in rejecting the PPA Related Obligations and Pepcos full claim is not recovered from the Mirant bankruptcy estate, Pepco may seek authority from the MPSC and the DCPSC to recover its additional costs. Pepco is committed to working with its regulatory authorities to achieve a result that is appropriate for its shareholders and customers. Under the provisions of the settlement agreements approved by the MPSC and the DCPSC in the deregulation proceedings in which Pepco agreed to divest its generation assets under certain conditions, the PPAs were to become assets of Pepcos distribution business if they could not be sold. Pepco believes that, if Mirant ultimately is successful in rejecting the PPA Related Obligations, these provisions would allow the stranded costs of the PPAs that are not recovered from the Mirant bankruptcy estate to be recovered from Pepcos customers through its distribution rates. If Pe pcos interpretation of the settlement agreements is confirmed, Pepco expects to be able to establish the amount of its anticipated recovery as a regulatory asset. However, there is no assurance that Pepcos interpretation of the settlement agreements would be confirmed by the respective public service commissions. If the PPA Related Obligations are successfully rejected, and there is no regulatory recovery, Pepco will incur a loss. However, the accounting treatment of such a loss depends on a number of legal and regulatory factors, and is not determinable at this time. The SMECO Agreement As a term of the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, Pepco assigned to Mirant a facility and capacity agreement with Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative, Inc. (SMECO) under which Pepco was obligated to purchase the capacity of an 84 megawatt combustion turbine installed and owned by SMECO at a former Pepco generating facility (the SMECO Agreement). The SMECO Agreement expires in 2015 and contemplates a monthly payment to SMECO of approximately $.5 million. Pepco is responsible to SMECO for the performance of the SMECO Agreement if Mirant fails to perform its obligations thereunder. At this time, Mirant continues to make post petition payments due to SMECO. On March 15, 2004, Mirant filed a complaint with the Bankruptcy Court seeking a declaratory judgment that the facility and capacity credit 69 agreement is an unexpired lease of non residential real property rather than an executory contract and that if Mirant were to successfully reject the agreement, any claim against the bankruptcy estate for damages made by SMECO (or by Pepco as subrogee) would be subject to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code that limit the recovery of rejection damages by lessors. Pepco believes that there is no reasonable factual or legal basis to support Mirants contention that the SMECO Agreement is a lease of real property. Litigation continues and the outcome of this proceeding cannot be predicted. Federal Tax Treatment of cross border Leases PCI maintains a portfolio of cross border energy sale leaseback transactions, which as of December 31, 2004 had a book value of approximately $1.2 billion. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 imposed new passive loss limitation rules that apply prospectively to leases (including cross border leases) entered into after March 12, 2004 with tax indifferent parties (i.e., municipalities and tax exempt or governmental entities). All of PCIs cross border energy leases are with tax indifferent parties and were entered into prior to 2004. Although this legislation is prospective in nature and does not affect PCIs existing cross border energy leases, it does not prohibit the IRS from challenging prior leasing transactions. In this regard, on February 11, 2005, the Treasury Department and IRS issued Notice 2005 13 informing taxpayers that the IRS intends to challenge on various grounds the purported tax benefits claimed by taxpayers enteri ng into certain sale leaseback transactions with tax indifferent parties, including those entered into on or prior to March 12, 2004 (the Notice). PCIs cross border energy leases are similar to those sale leaseback transactions described in the Notice. PCIs leases are currently under examination by the IRS as part of the normal PHI tax audit. PHI believes there is a substantial likelihood that the IRS will challenge the tax benefits realized from interest and depreciation deductions claimed by PCI with respect to these leases, or the timing of these benefits, for the years 2001 through 2004. The tax benefits claimed by PCI for these years were approximately $175 million. The ultimate outcome of this issue is uncertain; however, if the IRS prevails, PHI would be subject to additional taxes, along with interest and possibly penalties on the additional taxes, which could have a material adverse effect on PHIs results of operations and cash flow. PHI believes that its tax position related to these transactions was proper based on applicable statutes, regulations and case law, and intends to contest any adjustments proposed by the IRS; however, there is no assurance that PHIs position will prevail. Under SFAS No. 13, as currently interpreted, a deferral of tax benefits that does not change the total estimated net income from PHIs leases does not require an adjustment to the book value of the leases. However, if the IRS were to disallow, rather than require the deferral of, certain tax deductions related to PHIs leases, PHI would be required to adjust the book value of the leases and record a charge to earnings equal to the repricing impact of the disallowed deductions. Such a charge to earnings, if required, is likely to have a material adverse effect on PHIs results of operations for the period in which the charge is recorded. 70 In recent deliberations, The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has determined that a change in the timing of tax benefits also should require a repricing of the lease and an adjustment to the book value of a lease. Under this interpretation, a material change in the timing of cash flows under PHIs cross border leases as the result of a settlement with the IRS also would require an adjustment to the book value. PHI understands that the FASB intends to publish this guidance for comment in the near future to become effective at the end of 2005. If adopted, the application of this guidance could result in a material adverse effect on PHIs results of operations even if the resolution is limited to a deferral of the tax benefits realized by PCI from its leases. Rate Proceedings In February 2003, ACE filed a petition with the NJBPU to increase its electric distribution rates and its Regulatory Asset Recovery Charge (RARC) in New Jersey. The petition was based on actual data for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, and forecasted data for the three months ended December 31, 2002 and sought an overall rate increase of approximately $68.4 million, consisting of an approximately $63.4 million increase in electricity distribution rates and $5 million for recovery of regulatory assets through the RARC. In October 2003, ACE filed an update supporting an overall rate increase of approximately $41.3 million, consisting of a $36.8 million increase in electricity distribution rates and a RARC of $4.5 million. This petition was ACEs first increase request for electric distribution rates since 1991. The requested increase would apply to all rate schedules in ACEs tariff. The Ratepayer Advocate filed testimony on January 3, 2004, proposing an annual rate decrease of $11.7 million. Intervenor groups representing industrial users and local generators filed testimony that did not take a position with respect to an overall rate change but their proposals, if implemented, would affect the way in which an overall rate increase or decrease would be applied to the particular rates under which they receive service. ACEs rebuttal testimony, filed in February 2004, made some changes to its October filing and proposed an overall rate increase of approximately $35.1 million, consisting of a $30.6 million increase in distribution rates and a $4.5 million increase in the RARC. Hearings were held before an Administrative Law Judge in late March, early April and May 2004. At the hearing held in April 2004, the Ratepayer Advocate proposed an annual rate decrease of $4.5 million, modifying its earlier proposal that rates be decreased by $11.7 million annually. The Ratepayer Advocate and Staff of the NJBPU filed their briefs in this proceeding in August 2004. The Ratepayer Advocates brief supported its earlier proposal of an annual rate decrease of $4.5 million. The Staffs brief, however, stated for the first time its position calling for an overall decrease of $10.8 million. Reply briefs were filed on August 23, 2004. Settlement discussions between ACE, the NJBPU Staff and the Ratepayer Advocate have been ongoing. On December 12, 2003, the NJBPU issued an order also consolidating outstanding issues from several other proceedings into the base rate case proceeding. On December 22, 2003, ACE filed a Motion for Reconsideration in which it suggested that these issues be dealt with in a Phase II to the base rate case to address the outstanding issues identified in the December 12, 2003 Order. After discussion with the parties to the base rate case, it was agreed that a Phase II to the base rate case to address these issues, along with the $25.4 million of deferred restructuring costs previously transferred into the base rate case, would be initiated in April 2004. On April 15, 2004, ACE filed testimony with the NJBPU initiating a Phase II to the base rate proceeding described above. The parties to this case have 71 been actively engaged in settlement discussions in conjunction with settlement of Phase I issues. On August 31, 2004, ACE filed requests with the NJBPU proposing changes to its Transition Bond Charge, its Market Transition Charge Tax rate, and its BGS Reconciliation charges. The net impact of these rate changes is to decrease ACEs annual revenues by approximately 1.5%. All of these rate changes were implemented on October 1, 2004. On October 1, 2004, DPL submitted its annual Gas Cost Rate (GCR) filing to the DPSC. In its filing, DPL sought to increase its GCR by approximately 16.8% in anticipation of increasing natural gas commodity costs. The GCR, which permits DPL to recover its procurement gas costs through customer rates, became effective November 1, 2004 and is subject to refund pending evidentiary hearings. In addition, on November 29, 2004, DPL filed a supplemental filing seeking approval to further increase GCR rates by an additional 6.5% effective December 29, 2004. The additional GCR increase became effective December 29, 2004 and is subject to refund pending evidentiary hearings. The DPSC Staff and the Division of Public Advocate filed their testimony on March 7, 2005 recommending full approval of the GCR changes being sought by DPL, including the revisions to the tariff in the original and supplemental filings. A final order addressing both the Nov ember 1 and December 29 increases is expected in the spring of 2005. On February 13, 2004, DPL filed with the DPSC for a change in electric ancillary service rates that would have an aggregate effect of increasing annual Delaware electric revenues by $13.1 million or 2.4%. This filing was prompted by the increasing ancillary service costs charged to DPL by PJM. The proposed rates went into effect on March 15, 2004, subject to refund. On June 22, 2004, the DPSC approved a settlement agreement that provided for an increase having an aggregate effect of increasing annual Delaware electric revenues by $12.4 million, or 2.3%, with rates effective June 23, 2004. The approved increase was slightly less than the proposed increase that went into effect on March 15, 2004. As part of the settlement, the resulting estimated over collection of $75,000 was given by DPL to the State of Delaware Low Income Fund administered by the Delaware Department of Human Services on July 15, 2004. In compliance with the settlement approved by the MPSC in connection with the merger of Pepco and Conectiv, on December 4, 2003, DPL and Pepco submitted testimony and supporting schedules to review and reset if necessary its electricity distribution rates in Maryland to be effective July 1, 2004, when the then current distribution rate freeze/caps ended. DPLs filing demonstrated that it was in an under earning situation and, as allowed in the merger settlement, DPL requested that a temporary rate reduction implemented on July 1, 2003 for non residential customers be terminated effective July 1, 2004. DPL estimated that the termination of the rate reduction would increase its annual revenues by approximately $1.1 million. A settlement reached between the parties allowing for this $1.1 million increase to be effective July 1, 2004 was approved by the MPSC in Order No. 79186. With limited exceptions, DPL cannot increase its distribution rates until January 1, 2007. Pepcos filing demonstrated that it also was in an under earning situation. However the merger settlement provided that Pepcos distribution rates after July 1, 2004 could only remain the same or be decreased. With limited exceptions, Pepco cannot increase its distribution rates until January 1, 2007. In an order dated July 6, 2004 the MPSC affirmed the 72 Hearing Examiners recommendation that no rate decrease was warranted at that time. On July 3, 2004, Pepco filed a distribution rate review case with the DCPSC as required by the terms of the Pepco Conectiv merger settlement approved by the DCPSC. This case will determine whether Pepcos distribution rates will be decreased. In accordance with the terms of the merger settlement, Pepcos distribution rates cannot be increased as a result of the case. On November 24, 2004, the DCPSC issued an order that designated the issues to be considered in the case and set the hearing schedule. On December 17, 2004, Pepco filed supplemental direct testimony addressing the DCPSC designated issues. Pepcos filings indicate that no rate decrease is warranted. On March 4, 2005, the DCPSC issued an order granting a joint motion filed on March 3, 2005, on behalf of Pepco and several other parties in the case to suspend the procedural schedule to allow the parties to focus on completing settlement discussions. In the joint motion, the movin g parties informed the DCPSC that they had agreed in principle to settlement provisions that would resolve all issues in the proceeding and that a settlement agreement could be filed in the near future. Restructuring Deferral Pursuant to a July 1999 summary order issued by the NJBPU under the New Jersey Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act (EDECA) (which was subsequently affirmed by a final decision and order issued in March 2001), ACE was obligated to provide basic generation service (BGS) from August 1, 1999 to at least July 31, 2002 to retail electricity customers in ACEs service territory who did not choose a competitive energy supplier. The order allowed ACE to recover through customer rates certain costs incurred in providing BGS. ACEs obligation to provide BGS was subsequently extended to July 31, 2003. At the allowed rates, for the period August 1, 1999 through July 31, 2003, ACEs aggregate allowed costs exceeded its aggregate revenues from supplying BGS. These under recovered costs were partially offset by a $59.3 million deferred energy cost liability existing as of July 31, 1999 (LEAC Liability) that was related to ACEs Levelized Ener gy Adjustment Clause and ACEs Demand Side Management Programs. ACE established a regulatory asset in an amount equal to the balance. In August 2002, ACE filed a petition with the NJBPU for the recovery of approximately $176.4 million in actual and projected deferred costs relating to the provision of BGS and other restructuring related costs incurred by ACE over the four year period August 1, 1999 through July 31, 2003. The deferred balance was net of the $59.3 million offset for the LEAC Liability. The petition also requested that ACEs rates be reset as of August 1, 2003 so that there would be no under recovery of costs embedded in the rates on or after that date. The increase sought represented an overall 8.4% annual increase in electric rates and was in addition to the base rate increase discussed above. ACEs recovery of the deferred costs is subject to review and approval by the NJBPU in accordance with EDECA. In July 2003, the NJBPU issued a summary order, which (i) permitted ACE to begin collecting a portion of the deferred costs and reset rates to recover on going costs incurred as a result of EDECA, (ii) approved the recovery of $125 million of the deferred balance over a ten year amortization period beginning August 1, 2003, (iii) transferred to ACEs pending base rate case for further consideration approximately $25.4 million of the deferred balance, and (iv) estimated the overall deferral balance as of July 31, 2003 at $195 million, of which $44.6 million was disallowed recovery by ACE. In July 2004, the NJBPU issued its final order in the restructuring deferral 73 proceeding. The final order did not modify the amount of the disallowances set forth in the July 2003 summary order, but did provide a much more detailed analysis of evidence and other information relied on by the NJBPU as justification for the disallowances. ACE believes the record does not justify the level of disallowance imposed by the NJBPU. In August 2004, ACE filed with the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey, which hears appeals of New Jersey administrative agencies, including the NJBPU, a Notice of Appeal related to the July 2004 final order. ACE cannot predict the outcome of this appeal. Divestiture Cases District of Columbia Final briefs on Pepcos District of Columbia divestiture proceeds sharing application were filed on July 31, 2002 following an evidentiary hearing in June 2002. That application was filed to implement a provision of Pepcos DCPSC approved divestiture settlement that provided for a sharing of any net proceeds from the sale of Pepcos generation related assets. One of the principal issues in the case is whether Pepco should be required to share with customers the excess deferred income taxes (EDIT) and accumulated deferred investment tax credits (ADITC) associated with the sold assets and, if so, whether such sharing would violate the normalization provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and its implementing regulations. The District of Columbia allocated portions of EDIT and ADITC associated with the divested generation assets were approximately $6.5 million and $5.8 million, respectively. On March 4, 2003, the Internal Revenue S ervice (IRS) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) that is relevant to that principal issue. Comments on the NOPR were filed by several parties on June 2, 2003, and the IRS held a public hearing on June 25, 2003. As a result of the NOPR, three of the parties in the divestiture case filed comments with the DCPSC urging the DCPSC to decide the tax issues now on the basis of the proposed rule. Pepco filed comments with the DCPSC in reply to those comments, in which Pepco stated that the courts have held and the IRS has stated that proposed rules are not authoritative and that no decision should be issued on the basis of proposed rules. Instead, Pepco argued that the only prudent course of action is for the DCPSC to await the issuance of final regulations relating to the tax issues and then allow the parties to file supplemental briefs on the tax issues. Pepco cannot predict whether the IRS will adopt the regulations as proposed, make changes before issuing final regulations or decide not to adopt regulations. Other issues in the proceeding deal with the treatment of internal costs and cost allocations as deductions from the gross proceeds of the divestiture. Pepco believes that a sharing of EDIT and ADITC would violate the normalization rules. If Pepco were required to share EDIT and ADITC and, as a result, the normalization rules were violated, Pepco would be unable to use accelerated depreciation on District of Columbia allocated or assigned property. Pepco, in addition to sharing with customers the generation related ADITC balance, would have to pay to the IRS an amount equal to Pepcos $5.8 million District of Columbia jurisdictional generation related ADITC balance as well as its District of Columbia jurisdictional transmission and distribution related ADITC balance as of the later of the date a DCPSC order is issued and all rights to appeal have been exhausted or lapsed, or the date the DCPSC order becomes operative. As of December 31, 2004, the District of Columbia jurisdictional transmission and distribution related ADITC balance was approximately $6.0 million. 74 Pepco believes that its calculation of the District of Columbia customers share of divestiture proceeds is correct. However, depending on the ultimate outcome of this proceeding, Pepco could be required to make additional gain sharing payments to D.C. customers, including the payments described above related to EDIT and ADITC. Such additional payments (which, other than the EDIT and ADITC related payments, cannot be estimated) would be charged to expense in the quarter and year in which a final decision is rendered and could have a material adverse effect on Pepcos and PHIs results of operations for those periods. However, neither PHI nor Pepco believes that additional gain sharing payments, if any, or the ADITC related payments to the IRS, if required, would have a material adverse impact on its financial condition. It is uncertain when the DCPSC will issue a decision. Maryland Pepco filed its divestiture proceeds plan application in Maryland in April 2001. Reply briefs were filed in May 2002. The principal issue in the Maryland case is the same EDIT and ADITC sharing issue that was raised in the D.C. case. As of December 31, 2004, the Maryland allocated portions of EDIT and ADITC associated with the divested generation assets were approximately $9.1 million and $10.4 million, respectively. Other issues deal with the treatment of certain costs as deductions from the gross proceeds of the divestiture. In November 2003, the Hearing Examiner in the Maryland proceeding issued a proposed order that concluded that Pepcos Maryland divestiture settlement agreement provided for a sharing between Pepco and customers of the EDIT and ADITC associated with the sold assets. Pepco believes that such a sharing would violate the normalization rules and would result in Pepcos inability to use accelerated depreciation on Maryland allocated or assigned property. If the proposed order is affirmed, Pepco would have to share with its Maryland customers, on an approximately 50/50 basis, the Maryland allocated portion of the generation related EDIT, i.e., $9.1 million, and the generation related ADITC. If such sharing were to violate the normalization rules, Pepco, in addition to sharing with customers an amount equal to approximately 50 percent of the generation related ADITC balance, would be unable to use accelerated depreciation on Maryland allocated or assigned property. Furthermore, Pepco would have to pay to the IRS an amount equal to Pepcos $10.4 million Maryland jurisdictional generation related ADITC balance, as well as its Maryland retail jurisdictional ADITC transmission and distribution related balance as of the later of the date a MPSC order is issued and all rights to appeal have been exhausted or lapsed, or the date the MPSC order becomes operative. As of December 31, 2004, the Maryland retail jurisdiction al transmission and distribution related ADITC balance was approximately $10.7 million. The Hearing Examiner decided all other issues in favor of Pepco, except that only one half of the severance payments that Pepco included in its calculation of corporate reorganization costs should be deducted from the sales proceeds before sharing of the net gain between Pepco and customers. See also the disclosure above under "Divestiture Cases District of Columbia" regarding the March 4, 2003 IRS NOPR. Under Maryland law, if the proposed order is appealed to the MPSC, the proposed order is not a final, binding order of the MPSC and further action by the MPSC is required with respect to this matter. Pepco has appealed the Hearing Examiners decision on the treatment of EDIT and ADITC and corporate reorganization costs to the MPSC. Pepco cannot predict what the outcome of the appeal will be or when the appeal might be decided. Pepco believes that its calculation of the Maryland customers share of divestiture proceeds is correct. However, depending on the ultimate outcome of this proceeding, Pepco could be required to share with its customers approximately 50 percent 75 of the EDIT and ADITC balances described above and make additional gain sharing payments related to the disallowed severance payments. Such additional payments would be charged to expense in the quarter and year in which a final decision is rendered and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for those periods. However, neither PHI nor Pepco believes that additional gain sharing payments, if any, or the ADITC related payments to the IRS, if required, would have a material adverse impact on its financial condition. SOS and Default Service Proceedings District of Columbia In February 2003, the DCPSC opened a new proceeding to consider issues relating to (a) the establishment of terms and conditions for providing SOS in the District of Columbia after Pepcos obligation to provide SOS terminated on February 7, 2005, and (b) the selection of a new SOS provider. In December 2003, the DCPSC issued an order that set forth the terms and conditions for the selection of a new SOS provider(s) and the provision of SOS by Pepco on a contingency basis. In December 2003, the DCPSC also issued an order adopting terms and conditions that would apply if Pepco continued as the SOS provider after February 7, 2005. In March 2004, the DCPSC issued an order adopting the wholesale SOS model, i.e., Pepco would continue to be the SOS provider in the District of Columbia after February 7, 2005. This March 2004 order, as amended by a DCPSC order issued in July 2004, extends Pepcos obligation to provide default electricity supply at market rates for up to an additional 76 months for small commercial and residential customers, and for an additional 28 months for large commercial customers. In August 2004, the DCPSC issued an order adopting administrative charges for residential, small and large commercial DC SOS customers that are intended to allow Pepco to recover the administrative costs incurred to provide the SOS supply. The approved administrative charges include an average margin for Pepco of approximately $0.00248 per kilowatt hour, calculated based on total sales to residential, small and large commercial DC SOS customers over the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. Because margins vary by customer class, the actual average margin over any given time period will depend on the number of DC SOS customers from each customer class and the load taken by such customers over the time period. The administrative charges went into effect for Pepcos DC SOS sales on February 8, 2005. Pepco completed the first competitive procurement process for DC SOS at the end of October and filed the proposed new SOS rates with the DC PSC on November 3, 2004. The TPA with Mirant under which Pepco obtained the fixed rate DC SOS supply ended on January 22, 2005, while the new SOS supply contracts with the winning bidders in the competitive procurement process began on February 1, 2005. Pepco procured power separately on the market for next day deliveries to cover the period from January 23 through January 31, 2005, before the new DC SOS contracts began. Consequently, Pepco had to pay the difference between the procurement cost of power on the market for next day deliveries and the current DC SOS rates charged to customers during the period from January 23 through January 31, 2005. In addition, because the new DC SOS rates did not go into effect until February 8, 2005, Pepco had to pay the difference between the procurement cost of power under the new DC SOS contracts and the DC SOS rates charged to customers for the period from February 1 to February 7, 2005. The total amount of the diff erence is estimated to be approximately $8.7 million. This difference, however, will 76 be included in the calculation of the Generation Procurement Credit (GPC) for DC for the period February 8, 2004 through February 7, 2005. The GPC provides for a sharing between Pepcos customers and shareholders, on an annual basis, of any margins, but not losses, that Pepco earned providing SOS in the District of Columbia during the four year period from February 8, 2001 through February 7, 2005. Currently, based on the rates paid by Pepco to Mirant under the TPA Settlement, there is no customer sharing. However, in the event that Pepco were to ultimately realize a significant recovery from the Mirant bankruptcy estate associated with the TPA Settlement, the GPC would be recalculated, and the amount of customer sharing with respect to such recovery would be reduced because of the $8.7 million loss being included in the GPC calculation. Maryland Under a settlement approved by the MPSC in April 2003 addressing SOS service in Maryland following the expiration of Pepcos fixed rate default supply obligations in July 2004, Pepco is required to provide default electricity supply at market rates to residential and small commercial customers through May 2008, to medium sized commercial customers through May 2006, and to large commercial customers through May 2005. In accordance with the settlement, Pepco purchases the power supply required to satisfy its market rate default supply obligations from wholesale suppliers under contracts entered into pursuant to a competitive bid procedure approved by the MPSC. Pepco is entitled to recover from its default supply customers the cost of the default supply plus an average margin of $0.002 per kilowatt hour, calculated based on total sales to residential, small and large commercial Maryland SOS customers over the twelve months ended December 31, 200 3. Because margins vary by customer class, the actual average margin over any given time period will depend on the number of Maryland SOS customers from each customer class and the load taken by such customers over the time period. Under a settlement approved by the MPSC in April 2003 addressing SOS service in Maryland following the expiration of DPLs fixed rate default supply obligations to non residential customers in June 2004 and to residential customers through June 2004, DPL is required to provide default electricity supply at market rates to residential and small commercial customers through May 2008, to medium sized commercial customers through May 2006, and to large commercial customers through May 2005. In accordance with the settlement, DPL purchases the power supply required to satisfy its market rate default supply obligations from wholesale suppliers under contracts entered into pursuant to a competitive bid procedure approved and supervised by the MPSC. DPL is entitled to recover from its default supply customers the costs of the default supply plus an average margin of $0.002 per kilowatt hour, calculated based on total sales to residential, small, and large commercial Maryland SOS customers over the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. Because margins vary by customer class, the actual average margin over any given time period will depend on the number of Maryland SOS customers from each customer class and the load taken by such customers over the time period. Virginia Under amendments to the Virginia Electric Utility Restructuring Act implemented in March 2004, DPL is obligated to offer default service to customers in Virginia for an indefinite period until relieved of that obligation by the VSCC. DPL currently obtains all of the energy and capacity needed to fulfill its default service obligations in Virginia under a supply 77 agreement with Conectiv Energy. A prior agreement, also with Conectiv Energy, terminated effective December 31, 2004. The current contract was entered into after conducting a competitive bid procedure identical to the Maryland SOS process in most respects and Conectiv Energy was the lowest bidder to provide wholesale power supply for DPLs Virginia default service customers. The new supply agreement commenced January 1, 2005 and expires in May 2006. On October 26, 2004, DPL filed an application with the VSCC for approval to increase the rates that DPL charges its Virginia default service customers to allow it to recover its costs for power under the new supply agreement plus an administrative charge and a margin. A VSCC order dated November 17, 2004 allowed DPL to put interim rates into effect on January 1, 2005, subject to refund if the VSCC subsequently determined the rate is excessive. The interim rates reflected an increase of 1.0247 cents per kwh to the fuel rate, which provide for recovery of the entire amount being paid by DPL to Conectiv Energy, but did not include an administrative charge or margin, pending further consideration of this issue. Therefore, the November 17 order also directed the parties to file memoranda concerning whether administrative costs and a margin are properly recovered through a fuel clause mechanism. Memoranda were filed by DPL, the VSCC Staff and Virginias Office of Attorney General. The VSCC ruled on January 18, 2005, that the administrative charge and margin are base rate items not recoverable through a fuel clause. No appeal is planned regarding this filing. A settlement resolving all other issues and m aking the interim rates final was filed on March 4, 2005, contingent only on possible future adjustment depending on the result of a related proceeding at FERC. A hearing is scheduled for March 16, 2005, and the VSCC is expected to approve the settlement. Also in October, DPL and Conectiv Energy jointly filed an application with the VSCC under Virginias Affiliates Act requesting authorization for DPL to enter into a contract to purchase power from an affiliate. This authorization permits the contract to be executed with an affiliate, but is not a ruling on the merits of the contract. A VSCC order dated December 17, 2004 granted approval for DPL to purchase power from Conectiv Energy under the new contract according to its terms beginning January 1, 2005. On October 29, 2004, Conectiv Energy made a filing with FERC requesting authorization to enter into a contract to supply power to an affiliate. On December 30, 2004, FERC granted the requested authorization effective January 1, 2005, subject to refund and hearings on the narrow question whether, in the absence of direct VSCC oversight over the DPL competitive bid process, DPL unduly preferred its own affiliate, Conectiv Energy, in the design and implementation of the DPL competitive bid process, or unduly favored Conectiv Energy in the credit criteria and analysis applied. DPL cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. Delaware Under a settlement approved by the DPSC, DPL is required to provide default electricity supply to customers in Delaware until May 1, 2006. On October 19, 2004, the DPSC initiated a proceeding to investigate and determine which entity should act as the standard offer supplier in DPLs Delaware service territory after May 1, 2006, and what prices should be charged for SOS after May 1, 2006. Similar to the process used in Maryland, the process used in Delaware consists of three separate stages. The stage 1 process was constructed to allow the DPSC to determine by February 28, 2005 the fundamental issues related to the selection of an SOS supplier. Stage 2 will resolve issues relating to the process under which supply will be 78 acquired by the SOS provider and way in which SOS prices will be set and monitored. In the last stage, these selection and pricing mechanisms would be implemented to determine the post May 2006 SOS supplier and the post May 2006 SOS price. On January 26, 2005, the DPSC Staff issued a report recommending to the DPSC that DPL be selected as the SOS supplier, subject to further discussions as to how to establish SOS prices. On February 22, 2005, the DPSC voted to approve an SOS process that will allow a Wholesale Standard Offer Service Model with DPL as the SOS Provider. Issues including the length of this extension and any profit margin that DPL may be able to earn and retain in conjunction with this service have been deferred for further discussion and will be decided by the DPSC at a later date. A written DPSC order documenting this decision is expected sometime in March or April 2005. Proposed Shut Down of B.L. England Generating Facility; Construction of Transmission Facilities Pursuant to a September 25, 2003 NJBPU order, ACE filed a report on April 30, 2004 with the NJBPU recommending that the B.L. England generating facility be shut down in accordance with the terms of an April 26, 2004 preliminary settlement agreement among PHI, Conectiv and ACE, NJDEP and the Attorney General of New Jersey. The report stated that the operation of the B.L. England facility is necessary at the present time to satisfy reliability standards, but that those reliability standards could also be satisfied in other ways. The report concludes that, based on B.L. Englands current and projected operating costs resulting from compliance with more restrictive environmental requirements, the most cost effective way in which to meet reliability standards is to shut down the B.L. England facility and construct additional transmission lines into southern New Jersey. ACE cannot predict whether the NJBPU will approve the construction of the additional transmission lines. In letters dated May and September 2004 to PJM, ACE informed PJM of its intent, as owner of the B.L. England generating plant, to retire the entire plant (447 MW) on December 15, 2007. PJM completed its independent analysis to determine the upgrades required to eliminate any identified reliability problems resulting from the retirement of B.L. England and recommended that certain transmission upgrades be installed prior to the summer of 2008. ACEs independent assessment confirmed that the transmission upgrades identified by PJM are the transmission upgrades necessary to maintain reliability in the Atlantic zone after the retirement of B.L. England. The amount of the costs incurred by ACE to construct the recommended transmission upgrades that ACE would be permitted to recover from load serving entities that use ACEs transmission system would be subject to approval by FERC. The amount of construction costs that ACE would be permitted to re cover from retail ratepayers would be determined in accordance with the treatment of transmission related revenue requirements in retail rates under the jurisdiction of the appropriate state regulatory commission. ACE cannot predict how the recovery of such costs will ultimately be treated by FERC and the state regulatory commissions and, therefore, cannot predict the financial impact to ACE of installing the recommended transmission upgrades. However, in the event that the NJBPU makes satisfactory findings and grants other requested approvals concerning the retirement of B.L. England and approves the construction of the transmission upgrades required to maintain reliability in the Atlantic zone after such retirement, ACE expects to begin construction of the appropriate transmission upgrades while final decisions by FERC and state regulatory commissions concerning the methodology for recovery of the costs of such construction are still pending. 79 On November 1, 2004, ACE made a filing with the NJBPU requesting approval of the transmission upgrades required to maintain reliability in the Atlantic zone after the retirement of B.L. England. On December 22, 2004, ACE filed a petition with the NJBPU requesting that the NJBPU establish a proceeding that will consist of a Phase I and Phase II and that the procedural process for the Phase I proceeding require intervention and participation by all persons interested in the prudence of the decision to shut down B.L. England generating facility and the categories of stranded costs associated with shutting down and dismantling the facility and remediation of the site. ACE contemplates that Phase II of this proceeding, which would be initiated by an ACE filing in 2008 or 2009, would establish the actual level of prudently incurred stranded costs to be recovered from customers in rates. ACE cannot predict the outcome of these two proceedings. On November 12, 2004, ACE made a filing with the NJBPU requesting approval of year 2005 capital projects with respect to B.L. England. This filing was made pursuant the September 25, 2003 B.L. England rate order, which established a requirement that ACE file for approval of capital expenditures in excess of $1 million. For 2005, four projects, totaling $3.2 million in capital expenditures, have been identified as necessary to allow continued operation of B.L. England until its retirement. Two of these projects are well below the $1 million threshold set forth in the September 25, 2003 NJBPU order and two are above that threshold. ACE cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. General Litigation Asbestos During 1993, Pepco was served with Amended Complaints filed in the state Circuit Courts of Prince Georges County, Baltimore City and Baltimore County, Maryland in separate ongoing, consolidated proceedings known as "In re: Personal Injury Asbestos Case." Pepco and other corporate entities were brought into these cases on a theory of premises liability. Under this theory, plaintiffs argue that Pepco was negligent in not providing a safe work environment for employees or its contractors, who allegedly were exposed to asbestos while working on Pepcos property. Initially, a total of approximately 448 individual plaintiffs added Pepco to their complaints. While the pleadings are not entirely clear, it appears that each plaintiff sought $2 million in compensatory damages and $4 million in punitive damages from each defendant. Since the initial filings in 1993, additional individual suits have been filed against Pepco, and significant numbers of cases have been dismissed. As a result of two motions to dismiss, numerous hearings and meetings and one motion for summary judgment, Pepco has had approximately 400 of these cases successfully dismissed with prejudice, either voluntarily by the plaintiff or by the court. Of the approximately 250 remaining asbestos cases pending against Pepco, approximately 85 cases were filed after December 19, 2000, and have been tendered to Mirant for defense and indemnification pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement. While the aggregate amount of monetary damages sought in the remaining suits (excluding those tendered to Mirant) exceeds $400 million, Pepco believes the amounts claimed by current plaintiffs are greatly exaggerated. The amount of total liability, if any, and any related insurance recovery cannot be determined at this time; however, based on information and relevant circumstances known at this time, Pepco does not believe these suits will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition. However, if an 80 unfavorable decision were rendered against Pepco, it could have a material adverse effect on Pepcos and PHIs results of operations. Enron On December 2, 2001, Enron North America Corp. and several of its affiliates (collectively, Enron) filed for protection under the United States Bankruptcy Code. In December 2001, DPL and Conectiv Energy terminated all energy trading transactions under various agreements with Enron. In late January 2003, after several months of discussions between the parties concerning the amount owed by DPL and Conectiv Energy, Enron filed an adversary complaint against Conectiv Energy in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint sought, among other things, damages in the amount of approximately $11.7 million. On June 3, 2004, the Bankruptcy Court approved a settlement among Enron, Conectiv Energy and DPL pursuant to which Conectiv Energy paid Enron an agreed settlement amount that was less than the $11.7 million damages Enron sought and the parties released all claims against each other. Conectiv Energy had previously established a reserve in an amount equal to the agreed settlement payment. Accordingly, the settlement did not have an effect on earnings. Environmental Litigation PHI, through its subsidiaries, is subject to regulation by various federal, regional, state, and local authorities with respect to the environmental effects of its operations, including air and water quality control, solid and hazardous waste disposal, and limitations on land use. In addition, federal and state statutes authorize governmental agencies to compel responsible parties to clean up certain abandoned or unremediated hazardous waste sites. PHIs subsidiaries may incur costs to clean up currently or formerly owned facilities or sites found to be contaminated, as well as other facilities or sites that may have been contaminated due to past disposal practices. In May 2004, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) invited DPL to enter into pre filing negotiations in connection with DPLs alleged liability under CERCLA at the Diamond State Salvage site in Wilmington, Delaware. In the context of the negotiations, DOJ informed DPL that DPL is a de minimis party at the site. In February 2005, DPL entered into a de minimis consent decree with the United States which, if approved by the U.S. District Court, would require DPL to pay $144,000 as reimbursement of the governments response costs, resolve DPLs alleged liability, and provide DPL a covenant not to sue from the United States and protection from third party claims for contribution. In July 2004, DPL entered into an Administrative Consent Order with the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) to perform a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) to further identify the extent of soil, sediment and ground and surface water contamination related to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) operations at the Cambridge, Maryland site on DPL owned property and to investigate the extent of MGP contamination on adjacent property. The costs for completing the RI/FS for this site are approximately $300,000, approximately $50,000 of which will be expended in 2005. The costs of cleanup resulting from the RI/FS will not be determinable until the RI/FS is completed and an agreement with respect to cleanup is 81 reached with the MDE. DPL expects to complete the RI/FS in the first quarter of 2005. In October 1995, each of Pepco and DPL received notice from EPA that it, along with several hundred other companies, might be a PRP in connection with the Spectron Superfund Site in Elkton, Maryland. The site was operated as a hazardous waste disposal, recycling and processing facility from 1961 to 1988. In August 2001, Pepco entered into a consent decree for de minimis parties with EPA to resolve its liability at this site. Under the terms of the consent decree, which was approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland on March 31, 2003, Pepco made de minimis payments to the United States and a group of PRPs. In return, those parties agreed not to sue Pepco for past and future costs of remediation at the site and the United States will also provide protection against third party claims for contributions related to response actions at the site. The consent decree does not cover any damages to natural resources. However, Pepco believes that any liability that it might incur due to natural resource damage at this site would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. In February 2003, the EPA informed DPL that it will have no future liability for contribution to the remediation of the site. In the early 1970s, both Pepco and DPL sold scrap transformers, some of which may have contained some level of PCBs, to a metal reclaimer operating at the Metal Bank/Cottman Avenue site in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, owned by a nonaffiliated company. In December 1987, Pepco and DPL were notified by EPA that they, along with a number of other utilities and non utilities, were PRPs in connection with the PCB contamination at the site. In October 1994, an RI/FS including a number of possible remedies was submitted to the EPA. In December 1997, the EPA issued a Record of Decision that set forth a selected remedial action plan with estimated implementation costs of approximately $17 million. In June 1998, the EPA issued a unilateral administrative order to Pepco and 12 other PRPs to conduct the design and actions called for in its decision. On May 12, 2003, two of the potentially liable owner/operator entities filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On October 2, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed a Reorganization Plan that incorporates the terms of a settlement among the debtors, the United States and a group of utility PRPs including Pepco. Under the settlement, the reorganized entity/site owner will pay a total of $13.25 million to remediate the site. As of December 31, 2004, Pepco had accrued $1.7 million to meet its liability for a site remedy. At the present time, it is not possible to estimate the total extent of EPAs administrative and oversight costs or the expense associated with a site remedy ultimately implemented. However, Pepco believes that its liability at this site will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. In 1999, DPL entered into a de minimis settlement with EPA and paid approximately $107,000 to resolve its liability for cleanup costs at the site. The de minimis settlement did not resolve DPLs responsibility for natural resource damages, if any, at the site. DPL believes that any liability for natural resource damages at this site will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. In June 1992, EPA identified ACE as a PRP at the Bridgeport Rental and Oil Services Superfund Site in Logan Township, New Jersey. In September 82 1996, ACE along with other PRPs signed a consent decree with EPA and NJDEP to address remediation of the site. ACEs liability is limited to 0.232 percent of the aggregate remediation liability and thus far ACE has made contributions of approximately $105,000. Based on information currently available, ACE may be required to contribute approximately an additional $100,000. ACE believes that its liability at this site will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. In November 1991, NJDEP identified ACE as a PRP at the Delilah Road Landfill site in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey. In 1993, ACE, along with other PRPs, signed an administrative consent order with NJDEP to remediate the site. The soil cap remedy for the site has been completed and the NJDEP conditionally approved the report submitted by the parties on the implementation of the remedy in January 2003. In March 2004, NJDEP approved a Ground Water Sampling and Analysis Plan. The results of groundwater monitoring over the first year of this ground water sampling plan will help to determine the extent of post remedy operation and maintenance costs. In March 2003, EPA demanded from the PRP group reimbursement for EPAs past costs at the site, totaling $168,789. The PRP group objected to the demand for certain costs, but agreed to reimburse EPA approximately $19,000. Based on information currently available, ACE may be required to contribute approximately an additional $626,000. ACE believes that its liability for post remedy operation and maintenance costs will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. On April 7, 2000, approximately 139,000 gallons of oil leaked from a pipeline at a generation station that was owned by Pepco at Chalk Point Generating Station in Aquasco, Maryland. The pipeline was operated by Support Terminals Services Operating Partnership LP (ST Services), an unaffiliated pipeline management company. The oil spread from Swanson Creek to the Patuxent River and several of its tributaries. The area affected covers portions of 17 miles of shoreline along the Patuxent River and approximately 45 acres of marshland adjacent to the Chalk Point property. In December 2000, the Department of Transportation, Office of Pipeline Safety, Research and Special Programs Administration (OPS) issued a Notice of Probable Violation, Proposed Civil Penalty and Proposed Compliance Order (NOPV). The NOPV alleged various deficiencies in compliance with regulations related to spill reporting, operations and maintenance of the pipeline and record keeping, none of which relate to the cause of the spill. The NOPV was issued to both Pepco and ST Services and proposed a civil penalty in the amount of $674,000. On June 2, 2004, the OPS issued a Final Order regarding the NOPV in this matter. The Final Order assessed a total fine of $330,250, with $256,250 of that amount assessed jointly against Pepco and ST Services and the remaining $74,000 assessed solely against ST Services. ST Services subsequently filed a Petition for Reconsideration. All penalties were stayed pending the outcome of the Petition for Rec onsideration. On February 9, 2005, OPS issued a Decision on the Petition for Reconsideration that affirmed the Final Order. Pepcos share of the $330,250 penalty assessed pursuant to the Final Order amounts to $128,125. Preliminary Settlement Agreement with the NJDEP In an effort to address NJDEPs concerns regarding ACEs compliance with New Source Review (NSR) requirements at B.L. England, on April 26, 2004, PHI, Conectiv and ACE entered into a preliminary settlement agreement with NJDEP and the Attorney General of New Jersey. The preliminary settlement agreement outlines the basic parameters for a definitive agreement to resolve ACEs NSR liability at B.L. England and various other environmental issues at ACE and 83 Conectiv Energy facilities in New Jersey. Among other things, the preliminary settlement agreement provides that: contingent upon the receipt of necessary approvals from the NJBPU, PJM, NERC, FERC, and other regulatory authorities and the receipt of permits to construct certain transmission facilities in southern New Jersey ACE will permanently cease operation of the B.L. England generating facility by December 15, 2007. In the event that ACE is unable to shut down the B.L. England facility by December 15, 2007 through no fault of its own (e.g., because of failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals), B.L. England Unit 1 would be required to comply with stringent SO2, NOx and particulate matter emissions limits set forth in the preliminary settlement agreement by October 1, 2008, and B.L. England Unit 2 would be required to comply with these emissions limits by May 1, 2009. If ACE does not either shut down the B.L. England facility by December 15, 2007 or satisfy the emissions limits applicable in the event shut down is not so completed, ACE would be re quired to pay significant monetary penalties. to address ACEs appeal of NJDEP actions relating to NJDEPs July 2001 denial of ACEs request to renew a permit variance from sulfur in fuel requirements under New Jersey regulations, effective through July 30, 2001, that authorized Unit 1 at B.L. England generating station to burn bituminous coal containing greater than 1% sulfur, ACE will be permitted to combust coal with a sulfur content of greater than 1% at the B.L. England facility in accordance with the terms of B.L. Englands current permit until December 15, 2007 and NJDEP will not impose new, more stringent short term SO2 emissions limits on the B.L. England facility during this period. to resolve any possible civil liability (and without admitting liability) for violations of the permit provisions of the New Jersey APCA and the PSD provisions of the CAA relating to modifications that may have been undertaken at the B.L. England facility, ACE paid a $750,000 civil penalty to NJDEP on June 1, 2004, to compensate New Jersey for other alleged violations of the APCA and or the CAA, ACE will undertake environmental projects valued at $2 million, which are beneficial to the state of New Jersey and approved by the NJDEP in a consent order or other final settlement document. ACE will submit all federally required studies and complete construction of facilities necessary to satisfy the EPAs new cooling water intake structure regulations in accordance with a schedule that NJDEP will establish in the renewal NJPDES permit for the B.L. England facility. The schedule will take into account ACEs agreement, provided that all regulatory approvals are obtained, to shut down the B.L. England facility by December 15, 2007. to resolve any possible civil liability (and without admitting liability) for natural resource damages resulting from groundwater contamination at the B.L. England facility, Conectiv Energys Deepwater generating facility and ACEs operations center near Pleasantville, New Jersey, ACE and Conectiv will pay NJDEP $674,162 or property of equivalent value and will remediate the groundwater contamination at all three sites. If subsequent data indicate that groundwater contamination is more extensive than indicated in NJDEPs preliminary analysis, NJDEP may seek additional compensation for natural resource damages. 84 The preliminary settlement agreement also provides that the parties will work toward a consent order or other final settlement document that reflects the terms of the preliminary settlement agreement. ACE, Conectiv and PHI continue to negotiate with the NJDEP the terms of a consent order or other final settlement document. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES General The SEC has defined a companys most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates represent those estimates and assumptions that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and that have a material impact on financial condition or operating performance. Accounting Policy Choices Pepco Holdings management believes that based on the nature of the businesses in which its subsidiaries are primarily engaged, Pepco Holdings has very little choice regarding many of the accounting policies it utilizes. In that regard, the most significant portion of Pepco Holdings business consists of its regulated utility operations, which are subject to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71 "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." SFAS No. 71 does allow regulated entities, in appropriate circumstances, to establish regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities and to defer the income statement impact of certain costs that are expected to be recovered in future rates. However, management believes that in the areas that Pepco Holdings is afforded accounting policy choices, its selection from among the alternatives available generally would not have a material impact on the Compan ys financial condition or results of operations. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, such as Statement of Position 94 6 "Disclosure of Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties," requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Examples of significant estimates used by Pepco Holdings include the assessment of contingencies and the need/amount for reserves of future receipts from Mirant (refer to the "Relationship with Mirant" section, herein), the calculation of future cash flows and fair value amounts for use in goodwill and asset impairment evaluations, fair value calculations (based on estimating market pricing) associated with derivative instruments, pension and other post retirement benefits assumptions, unbilled revenue calculations, and judgment involved with assessing the probability of recovery of regulatory assets. Additionally, PHI is subject to legal, regulatory, and other proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. We record an estimated liability for these proceedings and claims based upon the probable and reasonably estimatable 85 criteria contained in SFAS No. 5 "Accounting for Contingencies." Although Pepco Holdings believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Goodwill Impairment Evaluation Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in its goodwill impairment evaluation process represent "Critical Accounting Estimates" because they (i) may be susceptible to change from period to period because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about the discounting of future cash flows, which are inherently uncertain, (ii) actual results could vary from those used in Pepco Holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material, and (iii) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on Pepco Holdings assets and the net loss related to an impairment charge could be material. The provisions of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," require the evaluation of goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. SFAS No. 142 indicates that if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill, an impairment charge may be necessary. Pepco Holdings goodwill that was generated in the transaction by which Pepco acquired Conectiv in 2002 was allocated to Pepco Holdings Power Delivery segment. In order to estimate the fair value of its Power Delivery segment, Pepco Holdings discounts the estimated future cash flows associated with the segment using a discounted cash flow model with a single interest rate that is commensurate with the risk involved with such an investment. The estimation of fair value is dependent on a number of factors, including but not limited to interest rates, future growth assumptions, operating and capital expenditure requirements and other factors, changes in which could materially impact the results of impairment testing. Pepco Holdings tested its goodwill for impairment as of July 1, 2004. This testing concluded that Pepco Holdings goodwill balance was not impaired. A hypothetical decrease in PHI Power Delivery segments forecasted cash flows of 10 percent would not have resulted in an impairment charge. Long Lived Assets Impairment Evaluation Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in its long lived asset impairment evaluation process represent "Critical Accounting Estimates" because they (i) are highly susceptible to change from period to period because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about undiscounted and discounted future cash flows and fair values, which are inherently uncertain, (ii) actual results could vary from those used in Pepco Holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material, and (iii) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on Pepco Holdings assets as well as the net loss related to an impairment charge could be material. SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" requires that certain long lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss shall only be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. The asset is deemed to not be recoverable when its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. In order to estimate an assets future cash flows, Pepco Holdings considers 86 historical cash flows. Pepco Holdings uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel costs, legislative initiatives, and operating costs. The process of determining fair value is done consistent with the process described in assessing the fair value of goodwill, discussed above. Derivative Instruments Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in accounting for its derivative instruments represent "Critical Accounting Estimates" because (i) the fair value of the instruments are highly susceptible to changes in market value and interest rate fluctuations, (ii) there are significant uncertainties in modeling techniques used to measure fair value in certain circumstances, (iii) actual results could vary from those used in Pepco Holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material, and (iv) changes in fair values and market prices could result in material impacts to Pepco Holdings assets, liabilities, other comprehensive income (loss), and results of operations. Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting for Derivatives, herein, for information on PHIs accounting for derivatives. Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments primarily to manage risk associated with commodity prices and interest rates. SFAS No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended, governs the accounting treatment for derivatives and requires that derivative instruments be measured at fair value. The fair value of derivatives is determined using quoted exchange prices where available. For instruments that are not traded on an exchange, external broker quotes are used to determine fair value. For some custom and complex instruments, an internal model is used to interpolate broker quality price information. Models are also used to estimate volumes for certain transactions. The same valuation methods are used to determine the value of non derivative, commodity exposure for risk management purposes. Pension and Other Post retirement Benefit Plans Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in reporting the costs of providing pension and other post retirement benefits represent "Critical Accounting Estimates" because (i) they are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of assumptions which are subjective in nature, (ii) they are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience, and (iii)changes in assumptions could impact Pepco Holdings expected future cash funding requirements for the plans and would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations, the reported pension and other post retirement benefit liability on the balance sheet, and the reported annual net periodic pension and other post retirement benefit cost on the income statement. In terms of quantifying the anticipated impact of a change in assumptions, Pepco Holdings estimates that a .25% change in the discount rate used to value the benef it obligations could result in a $5 million impact on its consolidated balance sheets and income statements. Additionally, Pepco Holdings estimates that a .25% change in the expected return on plan assets could result in a $4 million impact on the consolidated balance sheets and income statements and a .25% change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate could result in a $.5 million impact on its consolidated balance sheets and income statements. Pepco Holdings management consults with its actuaries and investment consultants when selecting its plan assumptions. 87 Pepco Holdings follows the guidance of SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Post retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," when accounting for these benefits. Under these accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. In accordance with these standards, the impact of changes in these assumptions and the difference between actual and expected or estimated results on pension and post retirement obligations is generally recognized over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans rather than immediately recognized in the income statement. Plan assets are stated at their market value as of the measurement date, December 31. Regulation of Power Delivery Operations The requirements of SFAS No. 71 apply to the Power Delivery businesses of Pepco, DPL, and ACE. Pepco Holdings believes that the judgment involved in accounting for its regulated activities represent "Critical Accounting Estimates" because (i) a significant amount of judgment is required (including but not limited to the interpretation of laws and regulatory commission orders) to assess the probability of the recovery of regulatory assets, (ii) actual results and interpretations could vary from those used in Pepco Holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material, and (iii) the impact that writing off a regulatory asset would have on Pepco Holdings assets and the net loss related to the charge could be material. New Accounting Policies Issued SFAS 123R In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share Based Payment" which establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments primarily for employee services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. In most cases, FAS 123R requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize that cost over the service period, normally the vesting period. FAS 123R will be effective for Pepco Holdings as of the July 1, 2005. Pepco Holdings is in the process of evaluating the impact of FAS 123R and does not anticipate that its implementation will hav e a material effect on its overall financial position or net results of operations. RISK FACTORS The business of PHI and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the events or conditions identified below. The occurrence of one or more of these events or conditions could have an adverse effect on the business of PHI and its subsidiaries, including, depending on the circumstances, their results of operations and financial condition. PHI and its subsidiaries are subject to substantial governmental regulation. If PHI or any of its subsidiaries receives unfavorable regulatory treatment, PHIs business could be negatively affected. PHI is a registered public utility holding company that is subject to regulation by the SEC under PUHCA. As a registered public utility holding 88 company, PHI requires SEC approval to, among other things, issue securities, acquire or dispose of utility assets or securities of utility companies and acquire other businesses. In addition, under PUHCA transactions among PHI and its subsidiaries generally must be performed at cost and subsidiaries are prohibited from paying dividends out of capital or unearned surplus without SEC approval. The utility businesses conducted by PHIs power delivery subsidiaries are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local regulatory agencies that significantly affects their operations. Each of Pepco, DPL and ACE is regulated by public service commissions in its service territories, with respect to, among other things, the rates it can charge retail customers for the delivery of electricity. In addition, the rates that the companies can charge for electricity transmission are regulated by FERC. The companies cannot change delivery or transmission rates without approval by the applicable regulatory authority. While the approved delivery and transmission rates are intended to permit the companies to recover their costs of service and earn a reasonable rate of return, the profitability of the companies is affected by the rates they are able to charge. In addition, if the costs incurred by any of the companies in operating it s transmission and distribution facilities exceed the allowed amounts for costs included in the approved rates, the financial results of that company, and correspondingly, PHI, will be adversely affected. PHIs subsidiaries also are required to have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from governmental agencies that regulate their businesses. PHI believes that its subsidiaries have obtained or sought renewal of the material permits, approvals and certificates necessary for their existing operations and that their businesses are conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, PHI is unable to predict the impact of future regulatory activities of any of these agencies on its business. Changes in or reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations, or the imposition of new laws or regulations, may require PHIs subsidiaries to incur additional expenses or to change the way they conduct their operations. PHIs business could be adversely affected by the Mirant bankruptcy. In 2000, Pepco sold substantially all of its electricity generation assets to Mirant. As part of the sale, Pepco entered into several ongoing contractual arrangements with Mirant and certain of its subsidiaries. On July 14, 2003, Mirant and most of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas. Depending on the outcome of the proceedings, the Mirant bankruptcy could adversely affect PHIs business. See "Relationship with Mirant Corporation," herein. Pepco may be required to make additional divestiture proceeds gain sharing payments to customers in the District of Columbia and Maryland. Pepco currently is involved in regulatory proceedings in Maryland and the District of Columbia related to the sharing of the net proceeds from the sale of its generation related assets. The principal issue in the proceedings is whether Pepco should be required to share with customers the excess deferred income taxes and accumulated deferred investment tax credits associated with the sold assets and, if so, whether such sharing would violate the normalization provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and its implementing regulations. Depending on the outcome of the proceedings, Pepco could be required to make additional gain sharing payments to customers and payments to the IRS in the amount of the associated 89 accumulated deferred investment tax credits, and Pepco might be unable to use accelerated depreciation on District of Columbia and Maryland allocated or assigned property. See Item 7 "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Regulatory and Other Matters." The operating results of PHIs power delivery and competitive energy subsidiaries fluctuate on a seasonal basis and can be adversely affected by changes in weather. The businesses of PHIs power delivery and competitive energy subsidiaries are seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on their operating performance. Demand for electricity is generally greater in the summer months associated with cooling and demand for electricity and gas is generally greater in the winter months associated with heating as compared to other times of the year. Accordingly, PHIs power delivery and competitive energy subsidiaries historically have generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer. The facilities of PHIs subsidiaries may not operate as planned or may require significant maintenance expenditures, which could decrease their revenues or increase their expenses. Operation of generation, transmission and distribution facilities involves many risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment, accidents, labor disputes and performance below expected levels. Older facilities and equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures for additions or upgrades to keep them operating at peak efficiency, to comply with changing environmental requirements, or to provide reliable operations. Natural disasters and weather related incidents, including tornadoes, hurricanes and snow and ice storms, also can disrupt generation, transmission and distribution delivery systems. Operation of generation, transmission and distribution facilities below expected capacity levels can reduce revenues and result in the incurrence of additional expenses that may not be recoverable from customers or through insurance. Furthermore, if PHIs operatin g subsidiaries are unable to perform their contractual obligations for any of these reasons, they may incur penalties or damages. The transmission facilities of PHIs power delivery subsidiaries are interconnected with the facilities of other transmission facility owners whose actions could have a negative impact on the operations of PHIs subsidiaries. The transmission facilities of Pepco, DPL and ACE are directly interconnected with the transmission facilities of contiguous utilities and as such are part of an interstate power transmission grid. FERC has designated a number of regional transmission operators to coordinate the operation of portions of the interstate transmission grid. Each of Pepco, DPL and ACE is a member of PJM, which is the regional transmission operator that coordinates the movement of electricity in all or parts of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Pepco, DPL and ACE operate their transmission facilities under the direction and control of PJM. PJM and the other regional transmission operators have established sophisticated systems that are designed to ensure the reliability of the operation of transmission facilities and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impact o n the operations of the other utilities. However, the systems put in 90 place by PJM and the other regional transmission operators may not always be adequate to prevent problems at other utilities from causing service interruptions in the transmission facilities of Pepco, DPL or ACE. If any of Pepco, DPL or ACE were to suffer such a service interruption, it could have a negative impact on its and PHIs business. The cost of compliance with environmental laws is significant and new environmental laws may increase the expenses of PHI and its subsidiaries. The operations of PHIs subsidiaries, both regulated and unregulated, are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations, relating to air quality, water quality, spill prevention, waste management, natural resources, site remediation, and health and safety. These laws and regulations require PHIs subsidiaries to make capital expenditures and to incur other expenditures to, among other things, meet emissions standards, conduct site remediation and perform environmental monitoring. PHIs subsidiaries also may be required to pay significant remediation costs with respect to third party sites. If PHIs subsidiaries fail to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond their control, such failure could result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities and the need to expend significant sums to come into compliance. In addition, PHIs subsidiaries incur costs to obtain and comply with a variety of environmental permits, licenses, inspections and other approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if PHIs subsidiaries fail to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, operations at affected facilities could be halted or subjected to additional costs. New environmental laws and regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, could impose more stringent limitations on the operations of PHIs subsidiaries or require them to incur significant additional costs. PHIs current compliance strategy may not successfully address the relevant standards and interpretations of the future. PHIs competitive energy business is highly competitive. The unregulated energy generation, supply and marketing businesses in the mid Atlantic region are characterized by intense competition at both the wholesale and retail levels. PHIs competitive energy businesses compete with numerous non utility generators, independent power producers, wholesale power marketers and brokers, and traditional utilities that continue to operate generation assets. This competition generally has the effect of reducing margins and requires a continual focus on controlling costs. PHIs competitive energy businesses rely on some transmission and distribution assets that they do not own or control to deliver wholesale electricity and to obtain fuel for their generation facilities. PHIs competitive energy businesses depend upon transmission facilities owned and operated by others for delivery to customers. The operation of their generation facilities also depends upon coal, natural gas or diesel fuel supplied by others. If electric transmission is disrupted or capacity is inadequate or unavailable, the competitive energy businesses ability to sell and deliver wholesale power, and therefore to fulfill their contractual obligations, could be adversely affected. Similarly, if the fuel supply to one or more of their generation plants is disrupted and storage or other alternative sources of supply are not available the competitive energy 91 businesses ability to operate their generating facilities could be adversely affected. Changes in technology may adversely affect PHIs power delivery and competitive energy businesses. Research and development activities are ongoing to improve alternative technologies to produce electricity, including fuel cells, microturbines and photovoltaic (solar) cells. It is possible that advances in these or other alternative technologies will reduce the costs of electricity production from these technologies, thereby making the generating facilities of PHIs competitive energy businesses less competitive. In addition, increased conservation efforts and advances in technology could reduce demand for electricity supply and distribution, which could adversely affect PHIs power delivery and competitive energy businesses. Changes in technology also could alter the channels through which retail electric customers buy electricity, which could adversely affect PHIs power delivery businesses. PHIs risk management procedures may not prevent losses in the operation of its competitive energy businesses. The operations of PHIs competitive energy businesses are conducted in accordance with sophisticated risk management systems that are designed to quantify risk. However, actual results sometimes deviate from modeled expectations. In particular, risks in PHIs energy activities are measured and monitored utilizing value at risk models to determine the effects of the potential one day favorable or unfavorable price movement. These estimates are based on historical price volatility and assume a normal distribution of price changes. Consequently, if prices significantly deviate from historical prices, PHIs risk management systems, including assumptions supporting risk limits, may not protect PHI from significant losses. In addition, adverse changes in energy prices may result in economic losses in PHIs earnings and cash flows and reductions in the value of assets on its balance sheet under applicable accounting rules. The commodity hedging procedures used by PHIs competitive energy businesses may not protect them from significant losses caused by volatile commodity prices. To lower the financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, PHIs competitive energy businesses routinely enter into contracts to hedge the value of their assets and operations. As part of this strategy, PHIs competitive energy businesses utilize fixed price, forward, physical purchase and sales contracts, tolling agreements, futures, financial swaps and option contracts traded in the over the counter markets or on exchanges. Conectiv Energys goal is to hedge 75% of both the expected power output of its generation facilities and the costs of fuel used to operate those facilities. However, the actual level of hedging coverage may vary from these goals. The economic hedge goals are approved by PHIs Corporate Risk Management Committee and may change from time to time based on market conditions. Due to the high heat rate of the Pepco Energy Services power plant generation, Pepco Energy Services infrequently locks in the f orward value of these plants with wholesale contracts. To the extent that PHIs competitive energy businesses have unhedged positions or their hedging procedures do not work as planned, fluctuating commodity prices could result in significant losses. The expiration of certain hedging arrangements could result in exposure of Conectiv Energy to a higher level of commodity price risk. 92 In order to lower its financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, Conectiv Energy entered into an agreement consisting of a series of energy contracts with an international investment banking firm. This agreement is designed to hedge approximately 50% of Conectiv Energys generation output and approximately 50% of its supply obligations, with the intention of providing Conectiv Energy with a more predictable earnings stream during the term of the agreement. This 35 month agreement consists of two major components: (i) a fixed price energy supply hedge that will be used to reduce Conectiv Energys financial exposure under its current POLR and SOS supply commitment to DPL which extends through May 2006 and (ii) a generation off take agreement under which Conectiv Energy will receive a fixed monthly payment from the counterparty, and the counterparty will receive the profit realized from the sale of approximately 50% of the elect ricity generated by Conectiv Energys plants (excluding the Edge Moor facility). This series of energy contracts will terminate in May 2006. As a result, Conectiv Energy will be exposed to a higher level of commodity price risk, unless it were to replace the expiring contracts with new or similar contracts to hedge plant output and any future supply obligations that Conectiv Energy might enter into. Conectiv Energy cannot at this time predict whether or to what extent it will, or will be able to, enter into new hedging contracts that provide commodity price risk protection. Acts of terrorism could adversely affect PHIs businesses. The threat of or actual acts of terrorism may affect the operations of PHI and its subsidiaries in unpredictable ways and may cause changes in the insurance markets, force PHI and its subsidiaries to increase security measures and cause disruptions of fuel supplies and markets. If any of PHIs infrastructure facilities, such as its electric generation, fuel storage, transmission or distribution facilities, were to be a direct target, or an indirect casualty, of an act of terrorism, its operations could be adversely affected. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism also could affect the ability of PHI and its subsidiaries to raise needed capital. The insurance coverage of PHI and its subsidiaries may not be sufficient to cover all casualty losses that they might incur. PHI and its subsidiaries currently have insurance coverage for their facilities and operations in amounts and with deductibles that they consider appropriate. However, there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, some risks, such as weather related casualties, may not be insurable. In the case of loss or damage to property, plant or equipment, there is no assurance that the insurance proceeds, if any, received will be sufficient to cover the entire cost of replacement or repair. PHI and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected by economic conditions. Periods of slowed economic activity generally result in decreased demand for power, particularly by industrial and large commercial customers. As a consequence, recessions or other downturns in the economy may result in decreased revenues and cash flows for PHIs power delivery and competitive energy businesses. The IRS challenge to cross border energy sale and lease back transactions entered into by a PHI subsidiary could result in loss of prior and future tax benefits. 93 PCI maintains a portfolio of cross border energy sale leaseback transactions, which as of December 31, 2004 had a book value of approximately $1.2 billion. All of PCIs cross border energy leases are with tax indifferent parties and were entered into prior to 2004. On February 11, 2005, the Treasury Department and IRS issued a notice informing taxpayers that the IRS intends to challenge the tax benefits claimed by taxpayers with respect to certain of these transactions. PHI believes there is a substantial likelihood that the IRS will challenge the tax benefits realized from the interest and depreciation deductions claimed by PCI with respect to these transactions, or the timing of these benefits, for the years 2001 through 2004. The tax benefits claimed by PCI for these years were approximately $175 million. If the IRS prevails, PHI would be subject to additional taxes, along with interest and possibly penalties on the additional taxes, which could have a material adverse effect on PHIs results of operations and cash flow. In addition, a disallowance, rather than a deferral, of tax benefits to be realized by PHI from these leases will require PHI to adjust the book value of its leases and record a charge to earnings equal to the repricing impact of the disallowed deductions. Such a change would likely have a material adverse effect on PHIs results of operations for the period in which the charge is recorded. See "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations "Regulatory and Other Matters." PHI and its subsidiaries are dependent on their ability to successfully access capital markets. An inability to access capital may adversely affect their business. PHI and its subsidiaries rely on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity and to satisfy their capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from their operations. Capital market disruptions, or a downgrade in credit ratings of PHI or its subsidiaries, would increase the cost of borrowing or could adversely affect their ability to access one or more financial markets. Disruptions to the capital markets could include, but are not limited to: recession or an economic slowdown; the bankruptcy of one or more energy companies; significant increases in the prices for oil or other fuel; a terrorist attack or threatened attacks; or a significant transmission failure. PHI may be required to, or may elect to, make significant cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plan. PHI follows the guidance of SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" in accounting for pension benefits under the Retirement Plan, a non contributory defined benefit plan. In accordance with these accounting standards, PHI makes assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. Changes in assumptions such as the use of a different discount rate or expected return on plan assets, affects the calculation of projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit obligation, reported pension liability on PHIs balance sheet, and reported annual net periodic pension benefit cost on PHIs income statement. 94 Furthermore, as a result of actual pension plan experience being different from expected, the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) could be greater than the fair value of pension plan assets. If this were to occur, PHI could be required to recognize an additional minimum liability as prescribed by SFAS No. 87. The liability would be recorded as a reduction to common equity through a charge to Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), and would not affect net income for the year. The charge to OCI would be restored through common equity in future periods when the fair value of plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation. PHIs funding policy is to make cash contributions to the pension plan sufficient for plan assets to exceed the ABO, and avoid the recognition of an additional minimum liability. Use of alternative assumptions could also impact the expected future cash funding requirements for the pension plan if PHIs defined benefit plan did not meet the minimum funding requirements of ERISA. PHIs cash flow, ability to pay dividends and ability to satisfy debt obligations depend on the performance of its operating subsidiaries. PHIs unsecured obligations are effectively subordinated to the liabilities and the outstanding preferred stock of its subsidiaries. PHI is a holding company that conducts its operations entirely through its subsidiaries, and all of PHIs consolidated operating assets are held by its subsidiaries. Accordingly, PHIs cash flow, its ability to satisfy its obligations to creditors and its ability to pay dividends on its common stock are dependent upon the earnings of the subsidiaries and the distribution of such earnings to PHI in the form of dividends. The subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts due on any debt or equity securities issued by PHI or to make any funds available for such payment. Because the claims of the creditors and preferred stockholders of PHIs subsidiaries are superior to PHIs entitlement to dividends, the unsecured debt and obligations of PHI are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of its subsidiaries and to the rights of the holders of preferred stock to receive dividend payments. Energy companies are subject to adverse publicity, which may render PHI and its subsidiaries vulnerable to negative regulatory and litigation outcomes. The energy sector has been among the sectors of the economy that have been the subject of highly publicized allegations of misconduct in recent years. In addition, many utility companies have been publicly criticized for their performance during recent natural disasters and weather related incidents. Adverse publicity of this nature may render legislatures, regulatory authorities, and tribunals less likely to view energy companies such as PHI and its subsidiaries in a favorable light and may cause them to be susceptible to adverse outcomes with respect to decisions by such bodies. Provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and PHIs organizational documents may discourage an acquisition of PHI. PHIs organizational documents and the Delaware General Corporation Law both contain provisions that could impede the removal of PHIs directors and discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire PHI. For example, PHI has a staggered board of directors that is divided into three classes of equal size, with one class elected each year for a term of three years. In addition, as a Delaware corporation, PHI is subject to the business combination law set forth in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could have the effect of delaying, discouraging or preventing an acquisition of PHI. 95 FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Some of the statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act and are subject to the safe harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

All dollar amounts are in millions. Operating Revenue 2004 2003 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 845.4 $ 786.8 $ 58.6 Default Supply Revenue 924.5 739.2 185.3 Other Electric Revenue 36.0 22.0 14.0 Total Operating Revenue $1,805.9 $1,548.0 $257.9 The table above shows the amount of Operating Revenue earned that is subject to price regulation (Regulated T&D Electric Revenue and Default Supply Revenue) and that which is not subject to price regulation (Other Electric Revenue). Regulated T&D (Transmission & Distribution) Electric Revenue consists of the revenue Pepco receives for delivery of electricity to its customers for which service Pepco is paid regulated rates. Default Supply Revenue (DSR) also known as Standard Offer Service (SOS) consists of revenue Pepco receives from the supply of electricity at regulated rates. The costs related to the supply of electricity are included in Fuel and Purchased Energy. Other Electric Revenue includes work and services performed on behalf of customers including other utilities, which is not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rents, late payments, and col lection fees. Regulated T&D Electric Revenue Regulated T&D Electric Revenue increased by $58.6 million primarily due to the following: (i) $12.4 million increase due to sales growth of 2.4%, (ii) $10.4 million increase due to favorable weather, and (iii) $39.9 million increase in tax pass throughs, primarily a county surcharge (offset in Other Taxes) reduced by (iv) $3.3 million decrease related to PJM network transmission revenue. Delivery sales were approximately 26,902,000 MwH, compared to approximately 25,994,000 MwH for the comparable period in 2003. Cooling degree days increased by 19.5% and heating degree days decreased by 6.5% for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to the same period in 2003. Default Supply Revenue Default Supply Revenue increased by $185.3 million primarily due to higher retail energy rates, the result of an effective rate increase in Maryland beginning in July 2004 and lower customer migration, principally in DC. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, Pepcos Maryland customers served by an alternate supplier represented 29% of Pepcos total 99 Maryland load, and Pepcos DC customers served by an alternate supplier represented 32% of Pepcos total DC load. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, Pepcos Maryland customers served by an alternate supplier represented 30% of Pepcos total Maryland load, and Pepcos DC customers served by an alternate supplier represented 48% of Pepcos total DC load. Default Supply sales were approximately 18,819,000 MwH for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, compared to approximately 16,199,000 MwH for the comparable period in 2003. Other Electric Revenue Other Electric Revenue increased by $14.0 million primarily due to increased customer requested work for the year ended December 31, 2004 (offset in Other Operation and Maintenance). Operating Expenses Fuel and Purchased Energy Fuel and Purchased Energy increased by $215.2 million to $899.3 million in 2004, from $684.1 million in 2003. The increase was primarily due to the following: (i) $180.6 million higher energy costs, the result of the new Default Supply rates for Maryland beginning in July 2004, and less customer migration, principally in DC, (ii) $74.6 million higher costs due to an increased rate change from the TPA Settlement with Mirant, effective October 2003, and (iii) $4.0 million higher PJM network transmission costs. These increases were partially offset by (i) $29.5 million reduction in the General Procurement Credit (GPC) which resulted from the lower Default Supply margin, and (ii) $14.5 million reserve recorded in September 2003 to reflect a potential exposure related to a pre petition receivable from Mirant Corp. for which Pepco filed a creditors claim in the bankruptcy proceedings. See the Regulatory and Other Matters Relationship with Mirant section herein for additional information related to Mirant. Other Operation and Maintenance Other Operation and Maintenance increased by $33.8 million to $272.3 million in 2004, from $238.5 million in 2003. The increase was primarily due to (i) $12.1 million of customer requested work (offset in Other Electric Revenue), (ii) $9.7 million higher electric system operation and maintenance costs, (iii) $4.8 million for severance costs, (iv) $2.8 million for right of way maintenance, (v)$2.7 million for the uncollectible and claims reserve, (vi) $3.3 million for Sarbanes Oxley external compliance costs, (vii) $2.5 million for legal and commission fees, (viii) $2.5 million for deferred costs and inventory adjustments, (ix) $2.5 million bad debt expense, offset by (x) $7.1 million for storm costs primarily related to one time charges related to Hurricane Isabel in September 2003 and (xi) $2.0 million decrease in other costs. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and Amortization expenses decreased by $3.5 million to $166.3 million in 2004 from $169.8 million in 2003. The decrease is primarily due to a $4.1 million decrease in energy use management (EUM) amortization. 100 Other Taxes Other Taxes increased by $42.2 million to $248.7 million in 2004, from $206.5 million in 2003. The increase was primarily due to (i) pass throughs of $33.9 million higher county surcharge and $3.6 million higher gross receipts/delivery taxes (offset in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue), (ii) $1.4 million higher Public Service Commission fees, (iii) $1.1 million county Right of Way fee adjustment in 2003, and (iv) $.8 million higher use tax. Gain on Sale of Assets Gain on Sale of Assets increased by $6.9 million primarily resulting from $6.6 million for the sale of land in the first quarter of 2004. Other Income (Expenses) Other Expenses increased by $2.1 million to a net expense of $72.9 million in 2004 from a net expense of $70.8 million in 2003. This was primarily due to $2.5 million lower interest income. Preferred Stock Dividend Requirements Preferred Stock Dividend Requirements decreased by $6.9 million from 2003. Of this decrease $4.6 million resulted from lower dividends in 2004 due to the redemption of the Trust Originated Preferred Securities in 2003 and $1.6 million was attributable to SFAS No. 150, which requires that dividends on Mandatorily Redeemable Serial Preferred Stock declared subsequent to July 1, 2003, be recorded as interest expense. Income Tax Expense Pepcos effective tax rate for 2004 was 37% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference were state income taxes (net of federal benefit) and the flow through of certain book tax depreciation differences, partially offset by the flow through of tax credits and changes in estimates related to tax liabilities of prior tax years subject to audit (which was the primary reason for the lower effective tax rate as compared to 2003). Pepcos effective tax rate for 2003 was 40% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference were state income taxes (net of federal benefit) and the flow through of certain book tax depreciation differences. The results of operations discussion below is for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. Lack Of Comparability Of Operating Results With Prior Years Pepcos results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 include only its operations. However, Pepcos results of operations for the year ended 2002, as previously reported by Pepco, include Pepcos operations consolidated with its pre merger subsidiaries (Potomac Capital Investment Corporation (PCI) and Pepco Energy Services) operations through July 2002. Accordingly, the results of operations for 2003 and 2002 are not comparable. In connection with Pepcos acquisition of Conectiv in August 2002, PCI and Pepco Energy Services were transferred to PHI. 101 Operating Revenue Pepcos consolidated operating revenue decreased by $440.0 million to $1,548.0 million in 2003 from $1,988.0 million in 2002. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in operating revenue recognized of $401.0 million at Pepco Energy Services and a decrease of $53.1 million at PCI. These decreases were due to the fact that Pepco Energy Services and PCIs operating results were not recorded by Pepco in 2003 because subsequent to July 2002 their ownership was transferred to PHI. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $14.1 million in Pepcos operating revenue due to the following: Regulated T&D Electric Revenue increased by $18.5 million in 2003. This increase results from a $19.2 million increase from a fuel tax pass through, partially offset by a $.7 million decrease in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue. The $.7 million decrease resulted from a .6% decrease in delivered kilowatt hour sales. DSR increased by $4.2 million in 2003 due to colder winter weather as heating degree days increased by 12.2% offset by a 30.2% decrease in cooling degree days. Pepcos retail access to a competitive market for generation services was made available to all Maryland customers on July 1, 2000 and to D.C. customers on January 1, 2001. At December 31, 2003, 14% of Pepcos Maryland customers and 11% of its D.C. customers have chosen alternate suppliers. These customers accounted for 912 megawatts of load in Maryland (of Pepcos total load of 3,439) and 970 megawatts of load in D.C. (of Pepcos total load of 2,269). At December 31, 2002, 16% of Pepcos Maryland customers and 13% of its D.C. customers have chosen alternate suppliers. These customers accounted for 1,175 megawatts of load in Maryland (of Pepcos total load of 3,369) and 1,140 megawatts of load in D.C. (of Pepcos total load of 2,326). Other Electric Revenue decreased $8.6 million primarily due to lower capacity (megawatts) available to sell, lower capacity market rates and restructuring in the PJM market. Operating Expenses Fuel and Purchased Energy Pepcos consolidated fuel and purchased energy decreased by $310.6 million to $684.1 million in 2003 from $994.7 million in 2002. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in fuel and purchases energy recognized of $340.3 million at Pepco Energy Services due to the fact that Pepco Energy Services operating results were not recorded by Pepco in 2003 because subsequent to July 2002 its ownership was transferred to PHI. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $29.7 million at Pepco primarily due to the recording of a $14.5 million reserve to reflect a potential exposure related to a pre petition receivable from Mirant Corp., for which Pepco filed a creditors claim in bankruptcy proceedings and from $15.3 million higher SOS costs. Other Operation and Maintenance Pepcos consolidated other operation and maintenance decreased by $78.4 million to $238.5 million in 2003 from $316.9 million in 2002. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in other operation and maintenance expense recognized of $57.9 million at Pepco Energy Services and a decrease of $24.6 million at PCI. These decreases were due to the fact that Pepco Energy 102 Services and PCIs operating results were not recorded by Pepco in 2003 because subsequent to July 2002 their ownership was transferred to PHI. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $4.1 million in Pepcos other operation and maintenance expense due to storm restoration expenses incurred. Depreciation and Amortization Pepcos consolidated depreciation and amortization increased by $16.5 million to $169.8 million in 2003 from $153.3 million in 2002. This increase was primarily due to an increase at Pepco of $11.6 related to software amortization during the year, partially offset by a decrease of $1.7 million at Pepco Energy Services and $3.2 million at PCI due to the fact that Pepco Energy Services and PCIs operating results were not recorded by Pepco in 2003 because subsequent to July 2002 their ownership was transferred to PHI. Other Taxes Pepcos consolidated other taxes increased by $8.3 million to $206.5 million in 2003, from $198.2 million for the corresponding period in 2002. This increase was due to higher fuel taxes over the period. Other Income (Expenses) Pepcos consolidated other expenses decreased by $25.5 million to $70.8 million in 2003 from $96.3 million for the corresponding period in 2002. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in operating revenue recognized of $19.8 at PCI, partially offset by a $3.1 million increase at Pepco. The decrease at PCI was due to the fact that its operating results were not recorded by Pepco in 2003 because subsequent to July 2002 its ownership was transferred to PHI. Income Tax Expense Pepcos effective tax rate in 2003 was 40% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference are state income taxes (net of federal benefit) and the flow through of certain book tax depreciation differences. In 2002, the effective rate was 37% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference are state income taxes (net of federal benefit) and the flow through of certain book tax depreciation differences, partially offset by the inclusion of the tax benefits of Pepcos pre merger subsidiaries through July 2002. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY General Financing Activities Pepco issued $275 million of secured senior notes with maturities of 10 and 30 years. Proceeds of $272.8 million were used to redeem higher interest rate securities of $210 million and to repay short term debt of $56.6 million. Pepco borrowed $100 million under a bank loan due in 2006. Proceeds were used to redeem Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock of $42.5 million and to repay short term debt. 103 Working Capital At December 31, 2004, Pepcos current assets on a consolidated basis totaled $354.4 million and its current liabilities totaled $416.1 million. At December 31, 2003, PHIs current assets totaled $347.2 million and its current liabilities totaled $418.6 million. Pepcos working capital deficit results in large part from the fact that, in the normal course of business, it acquires energy supplies for its customers before the supplies are delivered to, metered and then billed to customers. Short term financings are used to meet liquidity needs. Short term financings are also used, at times, to temporarily fund redemptions of long term debt, until long term replacement issues are completed. Summary of Cash Flows Pepcos cash flows for 2004, 2003, and 2002 are summarized below. Cash Provided / (Used) 2004 2003 2002 (Dollars in Millions) Operating Activities $ 274.5 $ 325.9 $ 471.8 Investing Activities (181.7) (197.5) (324.3) Financing Activities (98.1) (139.8) (644.8) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (5.3) $ (11.4) $(497.3) Operating Activities Cash flows from operating activities are summarized below for 2004, 2003, and 2002. Cash Provided / (Used) 2004 2003 2002 (Dollars in Millions) Net Income $ 96.6 $104.6 $139.1 Non cash adjustments to net income 194.0 249.4 296.2 Changes in working capital (16.1) (28.1) 36.5 Net cash provided by operating activities $274.5 $325.9 $471.8 Net cash flows provided by operating activities decreased by $51.4 million to $274.5 million for 2004 from $325.9 million for 2003. The $51.4 million decrease was mainly due to proceeds received on a note receivable from PCI in 2003. In 2003 cash flows from operating activities decreased by $145.9 million to $325.9 million from $471.8 million for 2002. The $145.9 million decrease was primarily due to a federal income tax refund in 2002 and less activity in 2003 due to the transfer of PCI as a subsidiary of Pepco to a subsidiary of Pepco Holdings, Inc. following the acquisition of Conectiv by Pepco in 2002. Investing Activities A summary of the significant items included in cash flows from investing activities during 2004, 2003, and 2002 are summarized below. 104 Cash Provided / (Used) 2004 2003 2002 (Dollars in Millions) Capital expenditures $(204.1) $(197.5) $(194.7) Cash proceeds from (purchase of) other investments 22.4 (13.2) Purchase of leveraged leases (111.6) All other investing cash flows, net (4.8) Net cash used by investing activities $(181.7) $(197.5) $(324.3) The change in investing activities in 2004 from 2003 mainly results from $22.4 million in proceeds received from the sale of two substations. The $126.8 million decrease in investing cash flows in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily results from the acquisition of leveraged leases in 2002 by PCI. Financing Activities Cash flows from financing activities result from issuing, repurchasing, and redeeming debt and equity securities, and paying dividends, and are summarized below for 2004, 2003, and 2002. Cash Provided / (Used) 2004 2003 2002 (Dollars in Millions) Dividends on common and preferred stock $(103.4) $ (68.2) $(499.9) Preferred securities redemptions (53.3) (127.5) (2.0) Long term debt, net 165.0 (5.7) (95.3) Short term debt, net (93.5) 67.5 (43.2) All other financing cash flows, net (12.9) (5.9) (4.4) Net cash used by financing activities $ (98.1) $(139.8) $(644.8) In December 2004, Pepco issued $100 million in long term debt via a term loan due December 1, 2006. Proceeds were used to redeem all ($42.5 million) of Pepcos mandatorily redeemable $3.40 series preferred stock and to repay short term debt. Also in 2004, Pepco issued $275 million of secured senior notes. In 2003 Pepco redeemed its mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities totaling $125 million. Dividends on common and preferred stock were $103.4 million in 2004, $68.2 million in 2003, and $499.9 million in 2002. The 2002 dividend was due to the August 1, 2002 acquisition of Conectiv by Pepco. Capital Requirements Construction Expenditures Pepcos construction expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2004 totaled $204.1 million. For the five year period 2005 through 2009, Pepcos total construction expenditures are projected to be approximately $750.0 million. 105 Dividends Under PUHCA, PHI is prohibited, without SEC approval, from paying dividends on its common stock from capital or unearned surplus. PHI generates no operating income of its own. Accordingly, its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders depends on dividends received from its subsidiaries. Pepcos articles of incorporation contain provisions restricting the amount of dividends that can be paid on common stock when preferred stock is outstanding if the applicable companys capitalization ratio is less than 25%. For this purpose, the capitalization ratio is equal to (i) common stock capital plus surplus, divided by (ii) total capital (including long term debt) plus surplus. Pension Funding Pepco Holdings has a noncontributory retirement plan (the Retirement Plan) that covers substantially all employees of Pepco, Conectiv and certain employees of other Pepco Holdings subsidiaries. Following the consummation of the acquisition of Conectiv by Pepco on August 1, 2002, the Pepco General Retirement Plan and the Conectiv Retirement Plan were merged into the Retirement Plan on December 31, 2002. The provisions and benefits of the merged Retirement Plan applicable to Pepco employees are identical to those in the original Pepco plan and the provisions and benefits applicable to Conectiv employees are identical to those in the original Conectiv plan. As of the 2004 valuation, the Retirement Plan satisfied the minimum funding requirements of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) without requiring any additional funding. However, PHIs funding policy with regard to the Retirement Plan is to maintain a funding level in excess of 100% of its accumulated benefit obligation. In 2004 and 2003, PHI made discretionary tax deductible cash contributions to the Retirement Plan in accordance with its funding policy. In 2004, the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for the Retirement Plan increased over 2003, due to the accrual of an additional year of service for participants and a decrease in the discount rate used to value the accumulated benefit obligation. The change in the discount rate reflected the continued decline in interest rates in 2004. The Retirement Plan assets achieved returns in 2004 in excess of the levels assumed in the valuation. As a result of the combination of these factors, in December 2004 PHI contributed $10 million (all of which was funded by Pepco) to the Retirement Plan. The contribution was made to ensure that under reasonable assumptions, the funding level at year end would be in excess of 100% of the accrued benefit obligation. In 2003, PHI contributed a total of $50 million (of which $30 million was funded by Pepco and $20 million was funded by ACE) to the Retirement Plan. Assuming no changes to the current pension p lan assumptions, PHI projects no funding will be required under ERISA in 2005; however, PHI may elect to make a discretionary tax deductible contribution, if required to maintain its assets in excess of its ABO. 106 Contractual Obligations And Commercial Commitments Summary information about Pepcos consolidated contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2004, is as follows: Contractual Maturity Obligation Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years (Dollars in Millions) Short term debt $ 14.0 $ 14.0 $ $ $ Long term debt 1,301.8 100.0 310.0 178.0 713.8 Interest payments on debt 712.5 73.0 128.3 87.5 423.7 Capital leases 229.7 15.7 31.1 30.6 152.3 Purchase power contracts (a) 1,114.3 154.9 799.5 159.9 Total $3,372.3 $357.6 $1,268.9 $456.0 $1,289.8 (a) Excludes the PPA Related Obligations that are part of the back to back agreement that was entered into with Mirant. Refer to the "Relationship with Mirant" section herein for additional information. Sources Of Capital Pepcos sources to meet its long term funding needs, such as capital expenditures, and its short term funding needs, such as working capital and the temporary funding of long term funding needs, include internally generated funds, security issuances and bank financing under new or existing facilities. Pepcos ability to generate funds from its operations and to access capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties. See "Risk Factors" for a discussion of important factors that may impact these sources of capital. Short Term Funding Sources Pepco has traditionally used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs, such as commercial paper, short term notes and bank lines of credit. Proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs, but may also be used to temporarily fund long term capital requirements. Pepco maintains an ongoing commercial paper program of up to $300 million. The commercial paper notes can be issued with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issue. In July 2004, Pepco Holdings, Pepco, DPL and ACE entered into a five year credit agreement with an aggregate borrowing limit of $650 million. This agreement replaced a $550 million 364 day credit agreement that was entered into on July 29, 2003. The respective companies also are parties to a three year credit agreement that was entered into in July 2003 and terminates in July 2006 with an aggregate borrowing limit of $550 million. Pepco Holdings credit limit under these facilities is $700 million, and the credit limit of each of Pepco, DPL and ACE under these facilities is the lower of $300 million and the maximum amount of short term debt authorized by the appropriate state commission, except that the aggregate amount of credit utilized by Pepco, DPL and ACE at any given time under these facilities may not exceed $500 million. Funds borrowed under these facilities are available for general corporate purposes. Either credit facility also can be used as credit support for the commercial paper programs of the respective companies. 107 The three year and five year credit agreements contain customary financial and other covenants that, if not satisfied, could result in the acceleration of repayment obligations under the agreements or restrict the ability of the companies to borrow under the agreements. Among these covenants is the requirement that each borrowing company maintain a ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization of 65% or less, computed in accordance with the terms of the credit agreements. As of December 31, 2004, the applicable ratios for Pepco Holdings, Pepco, DPL and ACE were 59.0%, 58.5%, 52.1% and 50.2%, respectively. The credit agreements also contain a number of customary events of default that could result in the acceleration of repayment obligations under the agreements, including (i) the failure of any borrowing company or any of its significant subsidiaries to pay when due, or the acceleration of, certain indebtedness under other borrowing arrangements, (ii) certain bankruptcy events, judgments or decrees against any borrowing company or its significant subsidiaries, and (iii) a change in control (as defined in the credit agreements) of Pepco Holdings or the failure of Pepco Holdings to own all of the voting stock of Pepco, DPL and ACE. In December 2004, PHI entered into a $50 million term loan due December 13, 2005 with a bank. The loan is variable rate, based on LIBOR. PHI has the option to select interest periods based on one, two, three or six month LIBOR rates. The covenants in the agreement are substantially consistent with those found in the three year and five year credit agreements. Proceeds from the loan were used to pay down commercial paper. Long Term Funding Sources The sources of long term funding for Pepco are the issuance of debt and equity securities and borrowing under long term credit agreements. Proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements, such as capital expenditures and new investments, and to refund or refinance existing securities. PUHCA Restrictions An SEC Financing Order dated July 31, 2002 (the "Financing Order"), requires that, in order to issue debt or equity securities, including commercial paper, Pepco must maintain a ratio of common stock equity to total capitalization (consisting of common stock, preferred stock, if any, long term debt and short term debt) of at least 30 percent. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, Pepcos common equity ratio was 42.8 percent and 43.4 percent, respectively. The Financing Order also requires that all rated securities issued by Pepco be rated "investment grade" by at least one nationally recognized rating agency. Accordingly, if Pepcos common equity ratio were less than 30 percent or if no nationally recognized rating agency rated a security investment grade, Pepco could not issue the security without first obtaining from the SEC an amendment to the Financing Order. If an amendment to the Financing Order is required to enable Pepco to effect a financing, there is no certainty that such an amendment could be obtained, as to the terms and conditions on which an amendment could be obtained or as to the timing of SEC action. The failure to obtain timely relief from the SEC, in such circumstances, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of Pepco. 108 Other Liquidity Considerations For a discussion of the potential impact of the Mirant bankruptcy on liquidity, see "Relationship with Mirant Corporation" section that follows. REGULATORY AND OTHER MATTERS Relationship with Mirant Corporation In 2000, Pepco sold substantially all of its electricity generation assets to Mirant Corporation, formerly Southern Energy, Inc., pursuant to an Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement. As part of the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, Pepco entered into several ongoing contractual arrangements with Mirant and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, Mirant). On July 14, 2003, Mirant Corporation and most of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas (the Bankruptcy Court). Depending on the outcome of the matters discussed below, the Mirant bankruptcy could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of Pepco Holdings and Pepco. However, management currently believes that Pepco Holdings and Pepco currently have sufficient cash, cash flow and borrowing capacity under their credit facilities and in the capital markets to be able to satisfy any additional cash requirements that have arisen or may arise due to the Mirant bankruptcy. Accordingly, management does not anticipate that the Mirant bankruptcy will impair the ability of Pepco Holdings or Pepco to fulfill their contractual obligations or to fund projected capital expenditures. On this basis, management currently does not believe that the Mirant bankruptcy will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of either company. Transition Power Agreements As part of the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, Pepco and Mirant entered into Transition Power Agreements for Maryland and the District of Columbia, respectively (collectively, the TPAs). Under these agreements, Mirant was obligated to supply Pepco with all of the capacity and energy needed to fulfill its standard offer service obligations in Maryland through June 2004 and its standard offer service obligations in the District of Columbia through January 22, 2005. To avoid the potential rejection of the TPAs, Pepco and Mirant entered into an Amended Settlement Agreement and Release dated as of October 24, 2003 (the Settlement Agreement) pursuant to which Mirant assumed both of the TPAs and the terms of the TPAs were modified. The Settlement Agreement also provided that Pepco has an allowed, pre petition general unsecured claim against Mirant Corporation in the amount of $105 million (the Pepco TPA Claim). Pepco has also asserted the Pepco TPA Claim against other Mirant entities that Pepco believes are liable to Pepco under the terms of the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreements Assignment and Assumption Agreement (the Assignment Agreement). Under the Assignment Agreement, Pepco believes that each of the Mirant entities assumed and agreed to discharge certain liabilities and obligations of Pepco as defined in the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement. Mirant has filed objections to these claims. Under the current plan of reorganization filed by the Mirant entities with the Bankruptcy Court, certain Mirant entities other than Mirant Corporation would 109 pay significantly higher portions of the claims of their creditors than would Mirant Corporation. The amount that Pepco will be able to recover from the Mirant bankruptcy estate with respect to the Pepco TPA Claim will depend on the amount of assets available for distribution to creditors of the Mirant entities that are found to be liable for the Pepco TPA Claim. Power Purchase Agreements Under agreements with FirstEnergy Corp., formerly Ohio Edison (FirstEnergy), and Allegheny Energy, Inc., both entered into in 1987, Pepco is obligated to purchase from FirstEnergy 450 megawatts of capacity and energy annually through December 2005 (the FirstEnergy PPA). Under an agreement with Panda, entered into in 1991, Pepco is obligated to purchase from Panda 230 megawatts of capacity and energy annually through 2021 (the Panda PPA). In each case, the purchase price is substantially in excess of current market price. As a part of the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, Pepco entered into a "back to back" arrangement with Mirant. Under this arrangement, Mirant is obligated, among other things, to purchase from Pepco the capacity and energy that Pepco is obligated to purchase under the FirstEnergy PPA and the Panda PPA at a price equal to the price Pepco is obligated to pay under the FirstEnergy PPA and the Panda PPA (the PPA Related Oblig ations). Pepco Pre Petition Claims When Mirant filed its bankruptcy petition on July 14, 2003, Mirant had unpaid obligations to Pepco of approximately $29 million, consisting primarily of payments due to Pepco in respect of the PPA Related Obligations (the Mirant Pre Petition Obligations). The Mirant Pre Petition Obligations constitute part of the indebtedness for which Mirant is seeking relief in its bankruptcy proceeding. Pepco has filed Proofs of Claim in the Mirant bankruptcy proceeding in the amount of approximately $26 million to recover this indebtedness; however, the amount of Pepcos recovery, if any, is uncertain. The $3 million difference between Mirants unpaid obligation to Pepco and the $26 million Proofs of Claim primarily represents a TPA settlement adjustment which is included in the $105 million Proofs of Claim filed by Pepco against the Mirant debtors in respect of the Pepco TPA Claim. In view of this uncertainty, Pepco, in the third quarter of 2003, expen sed $14.5 million to establish a reserve against the $29 million receivable from Mirant. In January 2004, Pepco paid approximately $2.5 million to Panda in settlement of certain billing disputes under the Panda PPA that related to periods after the sale of Pepcos generation assets to Mirant. Pepco believes that under the terms of the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, Mirant is obligated to reimburse Pepco for the settlement payment. Accordingly, in the first quarter of 2004, Pepco increased the amount of the receivable due from Mirant by approximately $2.5 million and amended its Proofs of Claim to include this amount. Pepco currently estimates that the $14.5 million expensed in the third quarter of 2003 represents the portion of the entire $31.5 million receivable unlikely to be recovered in bankruptcy, and no additional reserve has been established for the $2.5 million increase in the receivable. The amount expensed represents Pepcos estimate of the possible outcome in bankruptcy, although the amou nt ultimately recovered could be higher or lower. Mirants Attempt to Reject the PPA Related Obligations On August 28, 2003, Mirant filed with the Bankruptcy Court a motion seeking authorization to reject its PPA Related Obligations. Upon motions filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas (the 110 District Court) by Pepco and FERC, in October 2003, the District Court withdrew jurisdiction over the rejection proceedings from the Bankruptcy Court. In December 2003, the District Court denied Mirants motion to reject the PPA Related Obligations on jurisdictional grounds. The District Courts decision was appealed by Mirant and The Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Mirant Corporation (the Creditors Committee) to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (the Court of Appeals). On August 4, 2004, the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the District Court saying that the District Court has jurisdiction to rule on the merits of Mirants rejection motion, suggesting that in doing so the court apply a "more rigorous standard" than the business judgment rule usually applied by bankruptcy courts in ruling on rejection motions. On December 9, 2004, the District Court issued an order again denying Mirants motion to reject the PPA Related Obligations. The District Court found that the PPA Related Obligations are not severable from the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement and that the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement cannot be rejected in part, as Mirant was seeking to do. On December 16, the Creditors Committee appealed the District Courts order to the Court of Appeals, and on December 20, 2004, Mirant also appealed the District Courts order. As more fully discussed below, Mirant had been making regular periodic payments in respect of the PPA Related Obligations. On December 9, 2004, Mirant filed a notice with the Bankruptcy Court that it was suspending payments to Pepco in respect of the PPA Related Obligations. On December 13, 2004, Mirant failed to make a payment of approximately $17.9 million due to Pepco for the period November 1, 2004 to November 30, 2004. Mirant failed to make that payment. On December 23, 2004, Pepco received a payment of approximately $6.8 million from Mirant, which according to Mirant represented the market value of the power for which payment was due on December 13. Mirant has informed Pepco that it intends to continue to pay the market value, but not the above market portion, of the power purchased under the PPA Related Obligations. Pepco disagrees with Mirants assertion that it need only pay the market value and believes that the amount repr esenting the market value calculated by Mirant is insufficient. On January 21, 2005, Mirant made a approximately $21.1 million, which, according to Mirant, includes the payment for the FirstEnergy PPA for December 2004 and "includes the December 2004 TPA revenue in the amount of $29,093,173.43, the TPA costs in the amount of $37,865,924.10, and an allocated share of [FirstEnergys] PPA bill credits/charges in the amount of $5,490,164.79." Pepco disputes Mirants contention that the amount paid reflects the full amount due Pepco under these agreements for the applicable periods. As of March 1, 2005, Mirant has withheld payment of approximately $34.8 million due to Pepco under the PPA Related Obligations. On January 21, 2005, Mirant filed in the Bankruptcy Court a motion seeking to reject certain of its ongoing obligations under the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, including the PPA Related Obligations. On March 1, 2005 (as amended by order dated March 7, 2005), the District Court granted Pepcos motion to withdraw jurisdiction over the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement rejection proceedings from the Bankruptcy Court. In addition, the District Court ordered Mirant to pay on March 18, 2005, all past due unpaid amounts under the PPA Related Obligations. Mirant has filed a motion for reconsideration and a stay of the March 1, 2005 order. 111 Pepco is exercising all available legal remedies and vigorously opposing Mirants attempt to reject the PPA Related Obligations and other obligations under the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement in order to protect the interests of its customers and shareholders. While Pepco believes that it has substantial legal bases to oppose the attempt to reject the agreements, the outcome of Mirants efforts to reject the PPA Related Obligations is uncertain. If Mirant ultimately is successful in rejecting the PPA Related Obligations, Pepco could be required to repay to Mirant, for the period beginning on the effective date of the rejection (which date could be prior to the date of the courts order and possibly as early as September 18, 2003) and ending on the date Mirant is entitled to cease its purchases of energy and capacity from Pepco, all amounts paid by Mirant to Pepco in respect of the PPA Related Obligations, less an amount equal to the price at which Mirant resold the purchased energy and capacity. Pepco estimates that the amount it could be required to repay to Mirant in the unlikely event that September 18, 2003, is determined to be the effective date of rejection, is approximately $133.2 million as of March 1, 2005 (assuming Mirant continues to withhold unpaid amounts of approximately $34.8 million as of March 1, 2005. Mirant has also indicated to the Bankruptcy Court that it will move to require Pepco to disgorge all amounts paid by Mirant to Pepco in respect of the PPA Related Obligations, less an amount equal to the price at which Mirant resold the purchased energy and capacity, for the period July 14, 2003 (the date on which Mirant filed its bankruptcy petition) through rejection, if approved, on the theory that Mirant did not receive value for those payments. Pepco estimates that the amount it would be required to repay to Mirant on the disgorgement theory, in addition to the amounts described above, is approximately $22.5 million. Any repayment by Pepco of amounts paid by Mirant would entitle Pepco to file a claim against the bankruptcy estate in an amount equal to the amount repaid. Pepco believes that, to the extent such amounts were not recovered from the Mirant bankruptcy estate, they would be recoverable as stranded costs from customers through distribution rates as described below. The following are estimates prepared by Pepco of its potential future exposure if Mirants attempt to reject the PPA Related Obligations ultimately is successful. These estimates are based in part on current market prices and forward price estimates for energy and capacity, and do not include financing costs, all of which could be subject to significant fluctuation. The estimates assume no recovery from the Mirant bankruptcy estate and no regulatory recovery, either of which would mitigate the effect of the estimated loss. Pepco does not consider it realistic to assume that there will be no such recoveries. Based on these assumptions, Pepco estimates that its pre tax exposure as of March 1, 2005, representing the loss of the future benefit of the PPA Related Obligations to Pepco, is as follows: If Pepco were required to purchase capacity and energy from FirstEnergy commencing as of March 1, 2005, at the rates provided in the PPA (with an average price per kilowatt hour of approximately 6.0 cents) and resold the capacity and energy at market rates projected, given the characteristics of the FirstEnergy PPA, to be approximately 5.0 cents per kilowatt hour, Pepco estimates that it would cost approximately $31 million for the remainder of 2005, the final year of the FirstEnergy PPA. 112 If Pepco were required to purchase capacity and energy from Panda commencing as of March 1, 2005, at the rates provided in the PPA (with an average price per kilowatt hour of approximately 16.9 cents), and resold the capacity and energy at market rates projected, given the characteristics of the Panda PPA, to be approximately 7.4 cents per kilowatt hour, Pepco estimates that it would cost approximately $29 million for the remainder of 2005, approximately $34 million in 2006 and 2007, and approximately $34 million to $49 million annually thereafter through the 2021 contract termination date. The ability of Pepco to recover from the Mirant bankruptcy estate in respect to the Mirant Pre Petition Obligations and damages if the PPA Related Obligations are successfully rejected will depend on whether Pepcos claims are allowed, the amount of assets available for distribution to the creditors of the Mirant companies determined to be liable for those claims, and Pepcos priority relative to other creditors. At the current stage of the bankruptcy proceeding, there is insufficient information to determine the amount, if any, that Pepco might be able to recover from the Mirant bankruptcy estate, whether the recovery would be in cash or another form of payment, or the timing of any recovery. If Mirant ultimately is successful in rejecting the PPA Related Obligations and Pepcos full claim is not recovered from the Mirant bankruptcy estate, Pepco may seek authority from the MPSC and the DCPSC to recover its additional costs. Pepco is committed to working with its regulatory authorities to achieve a result that is appropriate for its shareholders and customers. Under the provisions of the settlement agreements approved by the MPSC and the DCPSC in the deregulation proceedings in which Pepco agreed to divest its generation assets under certain conditions, the PPAs were to become assets of Pepcos distribution business if they could not be sold. Pepco believes that, if Mirant ultimately is successful in rejecting the PPA Related Obligations, these provisions would allow the stranded costs of the PPAs that are not recovered from the Mirant bankruptcy estate to be recovered from Pepcos customers through its distribution rates. If Pe pcos interpretation of the settlement agreements is confirmed, Pepco expects to be able to establish the amount of its anticipated recovery as a regulatory asset. However, there is no assurance that Pepcos interpretation of the settlement agreements would be confirmed by the respective public service commissions. If the PPA Related Obligations are successfully rejected, and there is no regulatory recovery, Pepco will incur a loss. However, the accounting treatment of such a loss depends on a number of legal and regulatory factors, and is not determinable at this time. The SMECO Agreement As a term of the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, Pepco assigned to Mirant a facility and capacity agreement with Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative, Inc. (SMECO) under which Pepco was obligated to purchase the capacity of an 84 megawatt combustion turbine installed and owned by SMECO at a former Pepco generating facility (the SMECO Agreement). The SMECO Agreement expires in 2015 and contemplates a monthly payment to SMECO of approximately $.5 million. Pepco is responsible to SMECO for the performance of the SMECO Agreement if Mirant fails to perform its obligations thereunder. At this time, Mirant continues to make post petition payments due to SMECO. On March 15, 2004, Mirant filed a complaint with the Bankruptcy Court seeking a declaratory judgment that the facility and capacity credit 113 agreement is an unexpired lease of non residential real property rather than an executory contract and that if Mirant were to successfully reject the agreement, any claim against the bankruptcy estate for damages made by SMECO (or by Pepco as subrogee) would be subject to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code that limit the recovery of rejection damages by lessors. Pepco believes that there is no reasonable factual or legal basis to support Mirants contention that the SMECO Agreement is a lease of real property. Litigation continues and the outcome of this proceeding cannot be predicted. Rate Proceedings In compliance with the settlement approved by the MPSC in connection with the merger of Pepco and Conectiv, on December 4, 2003, Pepco submitted testimony and supporting schedules to review and reset if necessary its electricity distribution rates in Maryland to be effective July 1, 2004, when the then current distribution rate freeze/caps ended. Pepcos filing demonstrated that it was in an under earning situation. However the merger settlement provided that Pepcos distribution rates after July 1, 2004 could only remain the same or be decreased. With limited exceptions, Pepco cannot increase its distribution rates until January 1, 2007. In an order dated July 6, 2004 the MPSC affirmed the Hearing Examiners recommendation that no rate decrease was warranted at that time. On July 3, 2004, Pepco filed a distribution rate review case with the DCPSC as required by the terms of the Pepco Conectiv merger settlement approved by the DCPSC. This case will determine whether Pepcos distribution rates will be decreased. In accordance with the terms of the merger settlement, Pepcos distribution rates cannot be increased as a result of the case. On November 24, 2004, the DCPSC issued an order that designated the issues to be considered in the case and set the hearing schedule. On December 17, 2004, Pepco filed supplemental direct testimony addressing the DCPSC designated issues. Pepcos filings indicate that no rate decrease is warranted. On March 4, 2005, the DCPSC issued an order granting a joint motion filed on March 3, 2005, on behalf of Pepco and several other parties in the case to suspend the procedural schedule to allow the parties to focus on completing settlement discussions. In the joint motion, the movin g parties informed the DCPSC that they had agreed in principle to settlement provisions that would resolve all issues in the proceeding and that a settlement agreement could be filed in the near future. Divestiture Cases District of Columbia Final briefs on Pepcos District of Columbia divestiture proceeds sharing application were filed on July 31, 2002 following an evidentiary hearing in June 2002. That application was filed to implement a provision of Pepcos DCPSC approved divestiture settlement that provided for a sharing of any net proceeds from the sale of Pepcos generation related assets. One of the principal issues in the case is whether Pepco should be required to share with customers the excess deferred income taxes (EDIT) and accumulated deferred investment tax credits (ADITC) associated with the sold assets and, if so, whether such sharing would violate the normalization provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and its implementing regulations. The District of Columbia allocated portions of EDIT and ADITC associated with the divested generation assets were approximately $6.5 million and $5.8 million, respectively. On March 4, 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) that is relevant to that principal issue. Comments on the NOPR were filed by several parties on June 2, 2003, and the IRS held a public hearing on June 25, 2003. As a result of the NOPR, 114 three of the parties in the divestiture case filed comments with the DCPSC urging the DCPSC to decide the tax issues now on the basis of the proposed rule. Pepco filed comments with the DCPSC in reply to those comments, in which Pepco stated that the courts have held and the IRS has stated that proposed rules are not authoritative and that no decision should be issued on the basis of proposed rules. Instead, Pepco argued that the only prudent course of action is for the DCPSC to await the issuance of final regulations relating to the tax issues and then allow the parties to file supplemental briefs on the tax issues. Pepco cannot predict whether the IRS will adopt the regulations as proposed, make changes before issuing final regulations or decide not to adopt regulations. Other issues in the proceeding deal with the treatment of internal costs and cost allocations as deductions from the gross proceeds of the divestiture. Pepco believes that a sharing of EDIT and ADITC would violate the normalization rules. If Pepco were required to share EDIT and ADITC and, as a result, the normalization rules were violated, Pepco would be unable to use accelerated depreciation on District of Columbia allocated or assigned property. Pepco, in addition to sharing with customers the generation related ADITC balance, would have to pay to the IRS an amount equal to Pepcos $5.8 million District of Columbia jurisdictional generation related ADITC balance as well as its District of Columbia jurisdictional transmission and distribution related ADITC balance as of the later of the date a DCPSC order is issued and all rights to appeal have been exhausted or lapsed, or the date the DCPSC order becomes operative. As of December 31, 2004, the District of Columbia jurisdictional transmission and distribution related ADITC balance was approximately $6.0 million. Pepco believes that its calculation of the District of Columbia customers share of divestiture proceeds is correct. However, depending on the ultimate outcome of this proceeding, Pepco could be required to make additional gain sharing payments to D.C. customers, including the payments described above related to EDIT and ADITC. Such additional payments (which, other than the EDIT and ADITC related payments, cannot be estimated) would be charged to expense in the quarter and year in which a final decision is rendered and could have a material adverse effect on Pepcos and PHIs results of operations for those periods. However, neither PHI nor Pepco believes that additional gain sharing payments, if any, or the ADITC related payments to the IRS, if required, would have a material adverse impact on its financial condition. It is uncertain when the DCPSC will issue a decision. Maryland Pepco filed its divestiture proceeds plan application in Maryland in April 2001. Reply briefs were filed in May 2002. The principal issue in the Maryland case is the same EDIT and ADITC sharing issue that was raised in the D.C. case. As of December 31, 2004, the Maryland allocated portions of EDIT and ADITC associated with the divested generation assets were approximately $9.1 million and $10.4 million, respectively. Other issues deal with the treatment of certain costs as deductions from the gross proceeds of the divestiture. In November 2003, the Hearing Examiner in the Maryland proceeding issued a proposed order that concluded that Pepcos Maryland divestiture settlement agreement provided for a sharing between Pepco and customers of the EDIT and ADITC associated with the sold assets. Pepco believes that such a sharing would violate the normalization rules and would result in Pepcos inability to use accelerated depreciation on Maryland allocated or assigned property. If the proposed order is affirmed, Pepco would have to share with its Maryland customers, on an approximately 50/50 basis, the Maryland allocated portion of the generation related EDIT, i.e., $9.1 million, and the generation related ADITC. If such sharing were to 115 violate the normalization rules, Pepco, in addition to sharing with customers an amount equal to approximately 50 percent of the generation related ADITC balance, would be unable to use accelerated depreciation on Maryland allocated or assigned property. Furthermore, Pepco would have to pay to the IRS an amount equal to Pepcos $10.4 million Maryland jurisdictional generation related ADITC balance, as well as its Maryland retail jurisdictional ADITC transmission and distribution related balance as of the later of the date a MPSC order is issued and all rights to appeal have been exhausted or lapsed, or the date the MPSC order becomes operative. As of December 31, 2004, the Maryland retail jurisdictional transmission and distribution related ADITC balance was approximately $10.7 million. The Hearing Examiner decided all other issues in favor of Pepco, except that only one half of the severance payments that Pepco included in its calculation of corporate reorga nization costs should be deducted from the sales proceeds before sharing of the net gain between Pepco and customers. See also the disclosure above under "Divestiture Cases District of Columbia" regarding the March 4, 2003 IRS NOPR. Under Maryland law, if the proposed order is appealed to the MPSC, the proposed order is not a final, binding order of the MPSC and further action by the MPSC is required with respect to this matter. Pepco has appealed the Hearing Examiners decision on the treatment of EDIT and ADITC and corporate reorganization costs to the MPSC. Pepco cannot predict what the outcome of the appeal will be or when the appeal might be decided. Pepco believes that its calculation of the Maryland customers share of divestiture proceeds is correct. However, depending on the ultimate outcome of this proceeding, Pepco could be required to share with its customers approximately 50 percent of the EDIT and ADITC balances described above and make additional gain sharing payments related to the disallowed severance payments. Such additional payments would be charged to expense in the quarter and year in which a final decision is rendered and could have a material a dverse effect on results of operations for those periods. However, neither PHI nor Pepco believes that additional gain sharing payments, if any, or the ADITC related payments to the IRS, if required, would have a material adverse impact on its financial condition. SOS and Default Service Proceedings District of Columbia In February 2003, the DCPSC opened a new proceeding to consider issues relating to (a) the establishment of terms and conditions for providing standard offer service (SOS) in the District of Columbia after Pepcos obligation to provide SOS terminated on February 7, 2005, and (b) the selection of a new SOS provider. In December 2003, the DCPSC issued an order that set forth the terms and conditions for the selection of a new SOS provider(s) and the provision of SOS by Pepco on a contingency basis. In December 2003, the DCPSC also issued an order adopting terms and conditions that would apply if Pepco continued as the SOS provider after February 7, 2005. In March 2004, the DCPSC issued an order adopting the wholesale SOS model, i.e., Pepco would continue to be the SOS provider in the District of Columbia after February 7, 2005. This March 2004 order, as amended by a DCPSC order issued in July 2004, extends Pepcos obligation to provide default electricity supply at market rates for up to an additional 76 months for small commercial and residential customers, and for an additional 28 months for large commercial customers. In August 2004, the DCPSC issued an order adopting administrative charges for residential, small and large commercial DC SOS customers that are 116 intended to allow Pepco to recover the administrative costs incurred to provide the SOS supply. The approved administrative charges include an average margin for Pepco of approximately $0.00248 per kilowatt hour, calculated based on total sales to residential, small and large commercial DC SOS customers over the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. Because margins vary by customer class, the actual average margin over any given time period will depend on the number of DC SOS customers from each customer class and the load taken by such customers over the time period. The administrative charges went into effect for Pepcos DC SOS sales on February 8, 2005. Pepco completed the first competitive procurement process for DC SOS at the end of October and filed the proposed new SOS rates with the DCPSC on November 3, 2004. The TPA with Mirant under which Pepco obtained the fixed rate DC SOS supply ended on January 22, 2005, while the new SOS supply contracts with the winning bidders in the competitive procurement process began on February 1, 2005. Pepco procured power separately on the market for next day deliveries to cover the period from January 23 through January 31, 2005, before the new DC SOS contracts began. Consequently, Pepco had to pay the difference between the procurement cost of power on the market for next day deliveries and the current DC SOS rates charged to customers during the period from January 23 through January 31, 2005. In addition, because the new DC SOS rates did not go into effect until February 8, 2005, Pepco had to pay the difference between the procurement cost of power under the new DC SOS contracts and the DC SOS rates charged to customers for the period from February 1 to February 7, 2005. The total amount of the diff erence is estimated to be approximately $8.7 million. This difference, however, will be included in the calculation of the Generation Procurement Credit (GPC) for DC for the period February 8, 2004 through February 7, 2005. The GPC provides for a sharing between Pepcos customers and shareholders, on an annual basis, of any margins, but not losses, that Pepco earned providing SOS in the District of Columbia during the four year period from February 8, 2001 through February 7, 2005. Currently, based on the rates paid by Pepco to Mirant under the TPA Settlement, there is no customer sharing. However, in the event that Pepco were to ultimately realize a significant recovery from the Mirant bankruptcy estate associated with the TPA Settlement, the GPC would be recalculated, and the amount of customer sharing with respect to such recovery would be reduced because of the $8.7 million loss being included in the GPC calculation. Maryland Under a settlement approved by the MPSC in April 2003 addressing SOS service in Maryland following the expiration of Pepcos fixed rate default supply obligations in July 2004, Pepco is required to provide default electricity supply at market rates to residential and small commercial customers through May 2008, to medium sized commercial customers through May 2006, and to large commercial customers through May 2005. In accordance with the settlement, Pepco purchases the power supply required to satisfy its market rate default supply obligations from wholesale suppliers under contracts entered into pursuant to a competitive bid procedure approved by the MPSC. Pepco is entitled to recover from its default supply customers the cost of the default supply plus an average margin of $0.002 per kilowatt hour, calculated based on total sales to residential, small and large commercial Maryland SOS customers over the twelve months ended December 31, 200 3. Because margins vary by customer class, the actual average margin over any given time period will depend on the number of Maryland SOS customers from each customer class and the load taken by such customers over the time period. 117 General Litigation Asbestos During 1993, Pepco was served with Amended Complaints filed in the state Circuit Courts of Prince Georges County, Baltimore City and Baltimore County, Maryland in separate ongoing, consolidated proceedings known as "In re: Personal Injury Asbestos Case." Pepco and other corporate entities were brought into these cases on a theory of premises liability. Under this theory, plaintiffs argue that Pepco was negligent in not providing a safe work environment for employees or its contractors, who allegedly were exposed to asbestos while working on Pepcos property. Initially, a total of approximately 448 individual plaintiffs added Pepco to their complaints. While the pleadings are not entirely clear, it appears that each plaintiff sought $2 million in compensatory damages and $4 million in punitive damages from each defendant. Since the initial filings in 1993, additional individual suits have been filed against Pepco, and significant numbers of cases have been dismissed. As a result of two motions to dismiss, numerous hearings and meetings and one motion for summary judgment, Pepco has had approximately 400 of these cases successfully dismissed with prejudice, either voluntarily by the plaintiff or by the court. Of the approximately 250 remaining asbestos cases pending against Pepco, approximately 85 cases were filed after December 19, 2000, and have been tendered to Mirant for defense and indemnification pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement. While the aggregate amount of monetary damages sought in the remaining suits (excluding those tendered to Mirant) exceeds $400 million, Pepco believes the amounts claimed by current plaintiffs are greatly exaggerated. The amount of total liability, if any, and any related insurance recovery cannot be determined at this time; however, based on information and relevant circumstances known at this time, Pepco does not believe these suits will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition. However, if an unfavorable decision were rendered against Pepco, it could have a material adverse effect on Pepcos and PHIs results of operations. Environmental Litigation Pepco is subject to regulation by various federal, regional, state, and local authorities with respect to the environmental effects of its operations, including air and water quality control, solid and hazardous waste disposal, and limitations on land use. In addition, federal and state statutes authorize governmental agencies to compel responsible parties to clean up certain abandoned or unremediated hazardous waste sites. Pepco may incur costs to clean up currently or formerly owned facilities or sites found to be contaminated, as well as other facilities or sites that may have been contaminated due to past disposal practices. In October 1995, Pepco received notice from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that it, along with several hundred other companies, might be a potentially responsible party (PRP) in connection with the Spectron Superfund Site in Elkton, Maryland. The site was operated as a hazardous waste disposal, recycling and processing facility from 1961 to 1988. In August 2001, Pepco entered into a consent decree for de minimis parties with EPA to resolve its liability at this site. Under the terms of the consent decree, which was approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland on March 31, 2003, Pepco made de minimis payments to the United States and a group of PRPs. In return, those parties agreed not to sue Pepco for past and future costs of remediation at the site and the United 118 States will also provide protection against third party claims for contributions related to response actions at the site. The consent decree does not cover any damages to natural resources. However, Pepco believes that any liability that it might incur due to natural resource damage at this site would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. In the early 1970s, Pepco sold scrap transformers, some of which may have contained some level of PCBs, to a metal reclaimer operating at the Metal Bank/Cottman Avenue site in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, owned by a nonaffiliated company. In December 1987, Pepco was notified by EPA that it, along with a number of other utilities and non utilities, was a PRP in connection with the PCB contamination at the site. In October 1994, Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study including a number of possible remedies was submitted to the EPA. In December 1997, the EPA issued a Record of Decision that set forth a selected remedial action plan with estimated implementation costs of approximately $17 million. In June 1998, the EPA issued a unilateral administrative order to Pepco and 12 other PRPs to conduct the design and actions called for in its decision. On May 12, 2003, two of the potentially liable owner/operator entities filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On October 2, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed a Reorganization Plan that incorporates the terms of a settlement among the debtors, the United States and a group of utility PRPs including Pepco. Under the settlement, the reorganized entity/site owner will pay a total of $13.25 million to remediate the site. As of December 31, 2004, Pepco had accrued $1.7 million to meet its liability for a site remedy. At the present time, it is not possible to estimate the total extent of EPAs administrative and oversight costs or the expense associated with a site remedy ultimately implemented. However, Pepco believes that its liability at this site will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. On April 7, 2000, approximately 139,000 gallons of oil leaked from a pipeline at a generating facility that was owned by Pepco at Chalk Point generating facility in Aquasco, Maryland. The pipeline was operated by Support Terminals Services Operating Partnership LP (ST Services), an unaffiliated pipeline management company. The oil spread from Swanson Creek to the Patuxent River and several of its tributaries. The area affected covers portions of 17 miles of shoreline along the Patuxent River and approximately 45 acres of marshland adjacent to the Chalk Point property. In December 2000, the Department of Transportation, Office of Pipeline Safety, Research and Special Programs Administration (OPS) issued a Notice of Probable Violation, Proposed Civil Penalty and Proposed Compliance Order (NOPV). The NOPV alleged various deficiencies in compliance with regulations related to spill reporting, operations and maintenance of the pipeline and record keeping, none of which relate to the cause of the spill. The NOPV was issued to both Pepco and ST Services and proposed a civil penalty in the amount of $674,000. On June 2, 2004, the OPS issued a Final Order regarding the NOPV in this matter. The Final Order assessed a total fine of $330,250, with $256,250 of that amount assessed jointly against Pepco and ST Services and the remaining $74,000 assessed solely against ST Services. ST Services subsequently filed a Petition for Reconsideration. All penalties were stayed pending the outcome of the Petition for Rec onsideration. On February 9, 2005, OPS issued a Decision on the Petition for Reconsideration that affirmed the Final Order. Pepcos share of the $330,250 penalty assessed pursuant to the Final Order amounts to $128,125. 119 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES General The SEC has defined a companys most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations, and which require the Company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates represent those estimates and assumptions that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and that have a material impact on financial condition or operating performance. Accounting Policy Choices Pepcos management believes that based on the nature of the businesses in which its subsidiaries are primarily engaged, Pepco Holdings has very little choice regarding many of the accounting policies it utilizes. In that regard, the most significant portion of Pepco Holdings business consists of its regulated utility operations, which are subject to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71 "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." SFAS No. 71 does allow regulated entities, in appropriate circumstances, to establish regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities and to defer the income statement impact of certain costs that are expected to be recovered in future rates. However, management believes that in the areas that Pepco is afforded accounting policy choices, its selection from among the alternatives available generally would not have a material impact on the Companys financial con dition or results of operations. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, such as Statement of Position 94 6 "Disclosure of Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties," requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Examples of significant estimates used by Pepco Holdings include the assessment of contingencies and the need/amount for reserves of future receipts from Mirant (refer to the "Relationship with Mirant" section, herein), the calculation of future cash flows and fair value amounts for use in goodwill and asset impairment evaluations, fair value calculations (based on estimating market pricing) associated with derivative instruments, pension and other post retirement benefits assumptions, unbilled revenue calculations, and judgment involved with assessing the probability of recovery of regulatory assets. Additionally, Pepco is subject to legal, regulatory, and other proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. We record an estimated liability for these proceedings and claims based upon the probable and reasonably estimatable criteria contained in SFAS No. 5 "Accounting for Contingencies." Although Pepco believes tha t its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. 120 Long Lived Assets Impairment Evaluation Pepco believes that the estimates involved in its long lived asset impairment evaluation process represent "Critical Accounting Estimates" because they (i) are highly susceptible to change from period to period because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about undiscounted and discounted future cash flows and fair values, which are inherently uncertain, (ii) actual results could vary from those used in Pepco estimates and the impact of such variations could be material, and (iii) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on Pepcos assets as well as the net loss related to an impairment charge could be material. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," an impairment loss shall only be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. The asset is deemed to not be recoverable when its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. In order to estimate an assets future cash flows, Pepco considers historical cash flows. Pepco uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel costs, legislative initiatives, and operating costs. Pension and Other Post retirement Benefit Plans Pepco believes that the estimates involved in reporting the costs of providing pension and other post retirement benefits represent "Critical Accounting Estimates" because (i) they are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of assumptions which are subjective in nature, (ii) they are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience, and (iii) changes in assumptions could impact Pepcos expected future cash funding requirements for the plans and would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations, the reported pension and other post retirement benefit liability on the balance sheet, and the reported annual net periodic pension and other post retirement benefit cost on the income statement. In terms of quantifying the anticipated impact of a change in assumptions, PHI estimates that a .25% change in the discount rate used to value the benefit obligations co uld result in a $5 million impact on its consolidated balance sheets and income statements. Additionally, PHI estimates that a .25% change in the expected return on plan assets could result in a $4 million impact on the consolidated balance sheets and income statements and a .25% change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate could result in a $.5 million impact on its consolidated balance sheets and income statements. Pepcos management consults with its actuaries and investment consultants when selecting its plan assumptions. Pepco follows the guidance of SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Post retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," when accounting for these benefits. Under these accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. In accordance with these standards, the impact of changes in these assumptions and the difference between actual and expected or estimated results on pension and post retirement obligations is generally recognized over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans rather than immediately recognized in the income statement. 121 Regulation of Power Delivery Operations The requirements of SFAS No. 71 apply to Pepcos business. Pepco believes that the judgment involved in accounting for its regulated activities represent "Critical Accounting Estimates" because (i) a significant amount of judgment is required (including but not limited to the interpretation of laws and regulatory commission orders) to assess the probability of the recovery of regulatory assets, (ii) actual results and interpretations could vary from those used in Pepcos estimates and the impact of such variations could be material, and (iii) the impact that writing off a regulatory asset would have on Pepcos assets and the net loss related to the charge could be material. RISK FACTORS The business of Pepco is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the events or conditions identified below. The occurrence of one or more of these events or conditions could have an adverse effect on the business of Pepco, including, depending on the circumstances, its results of operations and financial condition. Pepco is a public utility that is subject to substantial governmental regulation. If Pepco receives unfavorable regulatory treatment, Pepcos business could be negatively affected. Pepcos utility business is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local regulatory agencies that significantly affects its operations. Pepcos operations are regulated in Maryland by the MPSC and in Washington, D.C. by the DCPSC with respect to, among other things, the rates it can charge retail customers for the delivery of electricity. In addition, the rates that Pepco can charge for electricity transmission are regulated by FERC. Pepco cannot change delivery or transmission rates without approval by the applicable regulatory authority. While the approved delivery and transmission rates are intended to permit Pepco to recover its costs of service and earn a reasonable rate of return, Pepcos profitability is affected by the rates it is able to charge. In addition, if the costs incurred by Pepco in operating its transmission and distribution facilities exceed the allowed amounts for costs included in the approved rate s, Pepcos financial results will be adversely affected. Pepco also is required to have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from governmental agencies that regulate its business. Pepco believes that it has obtained or sought renewal of the material permits, approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations and that its business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, Pepco is unable to predict the impact of future regulatory activities of any of these agencies on its business. Changes in or reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations, or the imposition of new laws or regulations, may require Pepco to incur additional expenses or to change the way it conducts its operations. 122 Pepcos business could be adversely affected by the Mirant bankruptcy. In 2000, Pepco sold substantially all of its electricity generation assets to Mirant. As part of the sale, Pepco entered into several ongoing contractual arrangements with Mirant and certain of its subsidiaries. On July 14, 2003, Mirant and most of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas. Depending on the outcome of the proceedings, the Mirant bankruptcy could adversely affect Pepcos business. See "Relationship with Mirant Corporation." Pepco could be required to make additional divestiture proceeds gain sharing payments to customers in the District of Columbia and Maryland. Pepco currently is involved in regulatory proceedings in Maryland and the District of Columbia related to the sharing of the net proceeds from the sale of its generation related assets. The principal issue in the proceedings is whether Pepco should be required to share with customers the excess deferred income taxes and accumulated deferred investment tax credits associated with the sold assets and, if so, whether such sharing would violate the normalization provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and its implementing regulations. Depending on the outcome of the proceedings, Pepco could be required to make additional gain sharing payments to customers and payments to the IRS in the amount of the associated accumulated deferred investment tax credits, and Pepco might be unable to use accelerated depreciation on District of Columbia and Maryland allocated or assigned property. See "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition an d Results of Operations Regulatory and Other Matters." The operating results of Pepco fluctuate on a seasonal basis and can be adversely affected by changes in weather. Pepcos electric utility business is seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on its operating performance. Demand for electricity is generally greater in the summer months associated with cooling and the winter months associated with heating as compared to other times of the year. Accordingly, Pepco historically has generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer. Pepcos facilities may not operate as planned or may require significant maintenance expenditures, which could decrease its revenues or increase its expenses. Operation of transmission and distribution facilities involves many risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment, accidents, labor disputes and performance below expected levels. Older facilities and equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures for additions or upgrades to keep them operating at peak efficiency, to comply with changing environmental requirements, or to provide reliable operations. Natural disasters and weather related incidents, including tornadoes, hurricanes and snow and ice storms, also can disrupt transmission and distribution delivery systems. Operation of transmission and distribution facilities below expected capacity levels can reduce revenues and result in the incurrence of additional expenses that may not be recoverable from customers or through insurance. Furthermore, if Pepco is unable to perform its contractual obligat ions for any of these reasons, it may incur penalties or damages. 123 Pepcos transmission facilities are interconnected with the facilities of other transmission facility owners whose actions could have a negative impact on Pepcos operations. The transmission facilities of Pepco are directly interconnected with the transmission facilities of contiguous utilities and as such are part of an interstate power transmission grid. FERC has designated a number of regional transmission operators to coordinate the operation of portions of the interstate transmission grid. Pepco is a member of PJM, which is the regional transmission operator that coordinates the movement of electricity in all or parts of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Pepco operates its transmission facilities under the direction and control of PJM. PJM and the other regional transmission operators have established sophisticated systems that are designed to ensure the reliability of the operation of transmission facilities and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impact on the operations of the other utilities. Howeve r, the systems put in place by PJM and the other regional transmission operators may not always be adequate to prevent problems at other utilities from causing service interruptions in the transmission facilities of Pepco. If Pepco were to suffer such a service interruption, it could have a negative impact on its business. The cost of compliance with environmental laws is significant and new environmental laws may increase Pepcos expenses. Pepcos operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations, relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources, site remediation, and health and safety. These laws and regulations require Pepco to incur expenses to, among other things, conduct site remediation and perform environmental monitoring. Pepco also may be required to pay significant remediation costs with respect to third party sites. If Pepco fails to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond its control, such failure could result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities and the need to expend significant sums to come into compliance. In addition, Pepco incurs costs to obtain and comply with a variety of environmental permits, licenses, inspections and other approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if Pepco fails to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, operations at affected facilities could be halted or subjected to additional costs. New environmental laws and regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, could impose more stringent limitations on Pepcos operations or require it to incur significant additional costs. Pepcos current compliance strategy may not successfully address the relevant standards and interpretations of the future. Changes in technology may adversely affect Pepcos electricity delivery businesses. Increased conservation efforts and advances in technology could reduce demand for electricity supply and distribution, which could adversely affect Pepcos business. In addition, changes in technology also could alter the channels through which retail electric customers buy electricity, which could adversely affect Pepcos business. 124 Acts of terrorism could adversely affect Pepcos business. The threat of or actual acts of terrorism may affect Pepcos operations in unpredictable ways and may cause changes in the insurance markets, force Pepco to increase security measures and cause disruptions of power markets. If any of Pepcos transmission or distribution facilities were to be a direct target, or an indirect casualty, of an act of terrorism, its operations could be adversely affected. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism also could affect the ability of Pepco to raise needed capital. Pepcos insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all casualty losses that it might incur. Pepco currently has insurance coverage for its facilities and operations in amounts and with deductibles that it considers appropriate. However, there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, some risks, such as weather related casualties, may not be insurable. In the case of loss or damage to property, plant or equipment, there is no assurance that the insurance proceeds, if any, received will be sufficient to cover the entire cost of replacement or repair. Pepco may be adversely affected by economic conditions. Periods of slowed economic activity generally result in decreased demand for power, particularly by industrial and large commercial customers. As a consequence, recessions or other downturns in the economy may result in decreased revenues and cash flows for Pepco. Pepco is dependent on its ability to successfully access capital markets. An inability to access capital may adversely affect its business. Pepco relies on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity and to satisfy its capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from its operations. Capital market disruptions, or a downgrade in Pepcos credit ratings, would increase the cost of borrowing or could adversely affect its ability to access one or more financial markets. Disruptions to the capital markets could include, but are not limited to: recession or an economic slowdown; the bankruptcy of one or more energy companies; significant increases in the prices for oil or other fuel; a terrorist attack or threatened attacks; or a significant transmission failure. Pepco may be required to, or may elect to, make significant cash contributions to the Retirement Plan. Pepco follows the guidance of SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" in accounting for pension benefits under the Retirement Plan, a non contributory defined benefit plan in which Pepcos employees participate. In accordance with these accounting standards, Pepco makes assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. Changes in assumptions such as the use of a different discount rate or expected return on plan assets, affects the calculation of projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit obligation, reported pension liability on Pepcos balance sheet, and reported annual net periodic pension benefit cost on Pepcos income statement. 125 Furthermore, as a result of actual pension plan experience being different from expected, the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) could be greater than the fair value of pension plan assets. If this were to occur, Pepco could be required to recognize an additional minimum liability as prescribed by SFAS No. 87. The liability would be recorded as a reduction to common equity through a charge to Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), and would not affect net income for the year. The charge to OCI would be restored through common equity in future periods when the fair value of plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation. PHIs funding policy is to make cash contributions to the pension plan sufficient for plan assets to exceed the ABO, and avoid the recognition of an additional minimum liability. Use of alternative assumptions could also impact the expected future cash funding requirements for the Retirement Plan if it did not meet the minimum funding requirements of ERISA. Energy companies are subject to adverse publicity, which may render Pepco vulnerable to negative regulatory and litigation outcomes. The energy sector has been among the sectors of the economy that have been the subject of highly publicized allegations of misconduct in recent years. In addition, many utility companies have been publicly criticized for their performance during recent natural disasters and weather related incidents. Adverse publicity of this nature may render legislatures, regulatory authorities, and tribunals less likely to view energy companies such as Pepco in a favorable light and may cause them to be susceptible to adverse outcomes with respect to decisions by such bodies. Because Pepco is a wholly owned subsidiary of PHI, PHI can exercise substantial control over its dividend policy and business and operations. All of the members of Pepcos board of directors, as well as many of Pepcos executive officers, are officers of PHI. Among other decisions, Pepcos board is responsible for decisions regarding payment of dividends, financing and capital raising activities, and acquisition and disposition of assets. Within the limitations of applicable law, including limitations imposed by PUHCA, and subject to the financial covenants under Pepcos outstanding debt instruments, Pepcos board of directors will base its decisions concerning the amount and timing of dividends, and other business decisions, on Pepcos earnings, cash flow and capital structure, but may also take into account the business plans and financial requirements of PHI and its other subsidiaries.

All dollar amounts are in millions. Electric Operating Revenue 2004 2003 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 369.7 $ 383.7 $(14.0) Default Supply Revenue 628.2 610.6 17.6 Other Electric Revenue 19.7 68.4 (48.7) Total Electric Operating Revenue $1,017.6 $1,062.7 $(45.1) The table above shows the amounts of Electric Operating Revenue earned that is subject to price regulation (Regulated T&D Electric Revenue and Default Supply Revenue) and that which is not subject to price regulation (Other Electric Revenue). Regulated T&D (Transmission & Distribution) Electric Revenue includes revenue DPL receives for delivery of electricity to its customers. Default Supply Revenue (DSR), also known as Standard Offer Service (SOS) in Maryland and Provider of Last Resort (POLR) in Delaware, includes revenue DPL receives from the supply of electricity at regulated rates. The costs related to the supply of electricity are included in Fuel and Purchased Energy. Other Electric Revenue includes work and services performed on behalf of customers including other utilities, which is not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rents, late payments, a nd collection fees. Regulated T&D Electric Revenue Regulated T&D Electric Revenue decreased by $14.0 million primarily due to the following unfavorable variances: (i) $6.6 million lower PJM network transmission revenue (offset in Fuel and Purchased Energy), (ii) $6.1 million lower industrial sales and average customer usage, (iii) $2.1 million related to Delaware competitive transition charge that ended in 2003, offset by (iv) $.8 million favorable weather impact. Delivered sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 were approximately 13,902,000 MwH compared to approximately 14,032,000 MwH for the comparable period in 2003. Cooling degree days increased by 1.8% while heating degree days decreased by 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the same period in 2003. Default Supply Revenue Default Supply Revenue increased by $17.6 million primarily due to the following: (i) $32.9 million due to higher retail energy rates, the result of effective rate increases in Delaware beginning in October 2003 and in Maryland beginning in June and July 2004, offset by (ii) $12.2 million increased customer migration, and (iii) $2.7 million unfavorable weather impact. 129 For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, DPLs Delaware customers served by an alternate supplier represented 6% of DPLs total Delaware load and DPLs Maryland customers served by alternate suppliers represented 23% of DPLs total Maryland load. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, the DPLs Delaware customers served by an alternate supplier represented 6% of DPLs total Delaware load and DPLs Maryland customers served by alternate suppliers represented 10% of DPLs total Maryland load. Default Supply sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 were approximately 12,008,000 MwH compared to approximately 12,362,000 MwH for the comparable period in 2003. Other Electric Revenue Other Electric Revenue decreased by $48.7 million primarily due to $43.0 million decrease in sales (offset in Fuel and Purchased Energy) to the Delaware Municipal Electric Corporation (DMEC) due to contract expiration on December 31, 2003 and $5.7 million lower other non operating revenue. Natural Gas Operating Revenue 2004 2003 Change Regulated Gas Revenue $169.1 $150.2 $18.9 Other Gas Revenue 58.6 40.8 17.8 Total Natural Gas Operating Revenue $227.7 $191.0 $36.7 The table above shows the amounts of Natural Gas Operating Revenue from sources that were subject to price regulation (Regulated Gas Revenue) and that were generally not subject to price regulation (Other Gas Revenue). Regulated Gas Revenue includes on system natural gas sales and the transportation of natural gas for customers. Other Gas Revenue includes off system natural gas sales and the resale of excess gas or system capacity. Regulated Gas Revenue Regulated Gas Revenue increased by $18.9 million primarily due to the following: (i) $21.0 million increase in the Gas Cost Rate due to higher natural gas commodity costs; this was effective November 1, 2003; (ii) $8.2 million increase in Gas Base Rates due to higher operating expenses and costs of capital; this was effective December 9, 2003; (iii) $2.0 million adjustment to unbilled revenues in 2003; and partially offset by (iv) $9.4 million decrease due to 2003 being significantly colder than normal, and (v) $2.9 million reduction related to lower industrial sales. For the year ended December 31, 2004, gas sales were approximately 21,600,000 Mcf as compared to approximately 22,900,000 Mcf for the comparable period in 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, heating degree days decreased 7.1% for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to the same period in 2003. Other Gas Revenue Other Gas Revenue increased by $17.8 million largely related to an increase in off system sales revenues of $17.3 million. The gas sold off system was made available by warmer winter weather and, as a result, reduced customer demand. (offset in Gas Purchased) 130 Operating Expenses Fuel and Purchased Energy Fuel and Purchased Energy decreased by $42.7 million to $656.8 million in 2004 from $699.5 million in 2003 due primarily to: (i)$43.0 million from the expiration of the DMEC contract in December 2003 (offset in Other Electric Revenue), (ii) $4.3 million reduction in PJM network transmission costs (partial offset in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue) offset by (iii) $4.6 million higher average energy costs, the result of the new Default Supply rates for Maryland beginning in June and July 2004. Gas Purchased Gas Purchased increased by $30.2 million to $162.5 million in 2004 from $132.3 million in 2003. Regulated gas purchased primarily resulted from the following: (i) net $20.4 million increase (substantially offset in revenue) from the settlement of financial hedges (entered into as part of DPLs regulated Natural Gas Hedge program), (ii) offset by a $7.2 million decrease in on system purchases due to warmer weather. In addition, other gas purchased increased by $17.0 million due to the increase in off system sales (offset in Other Gas Revenue). Other Operation and Maintenance Other Operation and Maintenance decreased by $7.8 million to $179.1 million in 2004 from $186.9 million in 2003. The decrease primarily resulted from (i) $3.3 million lower billing system IT costs, (ii) $2.5 million incremental storm costs primarily related to one time charges as a result of Hurricane Isabel in September 2003, (iii) $2.5 million decrease in uncollectible reserve, (iv) $2.4 million lower pension costs in 2004,and (v) $1.1 million decrease other costs, offset by (vi) $2.4 million higher severance costs in 2004 and (vii) $2.0 million for Sarbanes Oxley external compliance costs. Other Taxes Other Taxes decreased by $8.3 million to $27.6 million in 2004 from $35.9 million in 2003. The decrease primarily resulted from property tax true ups. Other Income (Expenses) Other Expenses decreased by $3.6 million to a net expense of $29.4 million in 2004 from a net expense of $33.0 million in 2003. This decrease is primarily due to a $4.2 million decrease in interest charges due to a reduction in long term debt, partially offset by a $1.2 million increase in short term interest charges. Preferred Stock Dividend Requirements Preferred Stock Dividend Requirements decreased by $2.8 million from 2003. This is attributable to SFAS No. 150, which requires that dividends on Mandatorily Redeemable Serial Preferred Stock declared subsequent to July 1, 2003, be recorded as interest expense. 131 Income Tax Expense DPLs effective tax rate for 2004 was 43% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference were state income taxes (net of federal benefit), changes in estimates related to tax liabilities of prior tax years subject to audit and the flow through of certain book tax depreciation differences (which was the primary reason for the higher effective tax rate as compared to 2003) partially offset by the flow through of Deferred Investment Tax Credits. DPLs effective tax rate for 2003 was 41% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference were state income taxes (net of federal benefit), changes in estimates related to tax liabilities of prior tax years subject to audit, partially offset by the flow through of Deferred Investment Tax Credits. RISK FACTORS The business of DPL is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the events or conditions identified below. The occurrence of one or more of these events or conditions could have an adverse effect on the business of DPL, including, depending on the circumstances, its results of operations and financial condition. DPL is a public utility that is subject to substantial governmental regulation. If DPL receives unfavorable regulatory treatment, DPLs business could be negatively affected. DPLs utility business is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local regulatory agencies that significantly affects its operations. DPLs operations are regulated in Maryland by the MPSC, in Delaware by the DPSC and in Virginia by the VSCC with respect to, among other things, the rates it can charge retail customers for the delivery of electricity and gas. In addition, the rates that DPL can charge for electricity transmission are regulated by FERC. DPL cannot change delivery or transmission rates without approval by the applicable regulatory authority. While the approved delivery and transmission rates are intended to permit DPL to recover its costs of service and earn a reasonable rate of return, DPLs profitability is affected by the rates it is able to charge. In addition, if the costs incurred by DPL in operating its transmission and distribution facilities exceed the allowed amounts for costs included in the approved r ates, DPLs financial results will be adversely affected. DPL also is required to have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from governmental agencies that regulate its business. DPL believes that it has obtained or sought renewal of the material permits, approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations and that its business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, DPL is unable to predict the impact of future regulatory activities of any of these agencies on its business. Changes in or reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations, or the imposition of new laws or regulations, may require DPL to incur additional expenses or to change the way it conducts its operations. The operating results of DPL fluctuate on a seasonal basis and can be adversely affected by changes in weather. DPLs utility businesses are seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on its operating performance. Demand for electricity is 132 generally greater in the summer months associated with cooling and demand for electricity and gas is generally greater in the winter months associated with heating as compared to other times of the year. Accordingly, DPL historically has generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer. DPLs facilities may not operate as planned or may require significant maintenance expenditures, which could decrease its revenues or increase its expenses. Operation of transmission and distribution facilities involves many risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment, accidents, labor disputes and performance below expected levels. Older facilities and equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures for additions or upgrades to keep them operating at peak efficiency, to comply with changing environmental requirements, or to provide reliable operations. Natural disasters and weather related incidents, including tornadoes, hurricanes and snow and ice storms, also can disrupt transmission and distribution delivery systems. Operation of transmission and distribution facilities below expected capacity levels can reduce revenues and result in the incurrence of additional expenses that may not be recoverable from customers or through insurance. Furthermore, if DPL is unable to perform its contractual obligations for any of these reasons, it may incur penalties or damages. DPLs transmission facilities are interconnected with the facilities of other transmission facility owners whose actions could have a negative impact on DPLs operations. The electricity transmission facilities of DPL are directly interconnected with the transmission facilities of contiguous utilities and as such are part of an interstate power transmission grid. FERC has designated a number of regional transmission operators to coordinate the operation of portions of the interstate transmission grid. DPL is a member of PJM, which is the regional transmission operator that coordinates the movement of electricity in all or parts of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. DPL operates its transmission facilities under the direction and control of PJM. PJM and the other regional transmission operators have established sophisticated systems that are designed to ensure the reliability of the operation of transmission facilities and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impact on the operations of the other utilities. However , the systems put in place by PJM and the other regional transmission operators may not always be adequate to prevent problems at other utilities from causing service interruptions in the transmission facilities of DPL. If DPL were to suffer such a service interruption, it could have a negative impact on its business. The cost of compliance with environmental laws is significant and new environmental laws may increase DPLs expenses. DPLs operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations, relating to air quality, water quality, spill prevention, waste management, natural resources, site remediation, and health and safety. These laws and regulations require DPL to incur expenses to, among other things, conduct site remediation and obtain permits. DPL also may be required to pay significant remediation costs with respect to third party sites. If DPL fails to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors 133 beyond its control, such failure could result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities and the need to expend significant sums to come into compliance. In addition, DPL incurs costs to obtain and comply with a variety of environmental permits, licenses, inspections and other approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if DPL fails to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, operations at affected facilities could be halted or subjected to additional costs. New environmental laws and regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, could impose more stringent limitations on DPLs operations or require it to incur significant additional costs. DPLs current compliance strategy may not successfully address the relevant standards and interpretations of the future. Changes in technology may adversely affect DPLs electricity and gas delivery businesses. Increased conservation efforts and advances in technology could reduce demand for electricity and gas supply and distribution, which could adversely affect DPLs business. In addition, changes in technology also could alter the channels through which retail electric customers buy electricity, which could adversely affect DPLs business. Acts of terrorism could adversely affect DPLs business. The threat of or actual acts of terrorism may affect DPLs operations in unpredictable ways and may cause changes in the insurance markets, force DPL to increase security measures and cause disruptions of power markets. If any of DPLs transmission or distribution facilities were to be a direct target, or an indirect casualty, of an act of terrorism, its operations could be adversely affected. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism also could affect the ability of DPL to raise needed capital. DPLs insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all casualty losses that it might incur. DPL currently has insurance coverage for its facilities and operations in amounts and with deductibles that it considers appropriate. However, there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, some risks, such as weather related casualties, may not be insurable. In the case of loss or damage to property, plant or equipment, there is no assurance that the insurance proceeds, if any, received will be sufficient to cover the entire cost of replacement or repair. DPL may be adversely affected by economic conditions. Periods of slowed economic activity generally result in decreased demand for power, particularly by industrial and large commercial customers. As a consequence, recessions or other downturns in the economy may result in decreased revenues and cash flows for DPL. 134 DPL is dependent on its ability to successfully access capital markets. An inability to access capital may adversely affect its business. DPL relies on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity and to satisfy its capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from its operations. Capital market disruptions, or a downgrade in DPLs credit ratings, would increase the cost of borrowing or could adversely affect its ability to access one or more financial markets. Disruptions to the capital markets could include, but are not limited to: recession or an economic slowdown; the bankruptcy of one or more energy companies; significant increases in the prices for oil or other fuel; a terrorist attack or threatened attacks; or a significant transmission failure. DPL may be required to, or may elect to, make significant cash contributions to the Retirement Plan. DPL follows the guidance of SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" in accounting for pension benefits under the Retirement Plan, a non contributory defined benefit plan in which DPLs employees participate. In accordance with these accounting standards, DPL makes assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. Changes in assumptions such as the use of a different discount rate or expected return on plan assets, affects the calculation of projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit obligation, reported pension liability on DPLs balance sheet, and reported annual net periodic pension benefit cost on DPLs income statement. Furthermore, as a result of actual pension plan experience being different from expected, the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) could be greater than the fair value of pension plan assets. If this were to occur, DPL could be required to recognize an additional minimum liability as prescribed by SFAS No. 87. The liability would be recorded as a reduction to common equity through a charge to Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), and would not affect net income for the year. The charge to OCI would be restored through common equity in future periods when the fair value of plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation. PHIs funding policy is to make cash contributions to the pension plan sufficient for plan assets to exceed the ABO, and avoid the recognition of an additional minimum liability. Use of alternative assumptions could also impact the expected future cash funding requirements for the Retirement Plan if it did not meet the minimum funding requirements of ERISA. Energy companies are subject to adverse publicity, which may render DPL vulnerable to negative regulatory and litigation outcomes. The energy sector has been among the sectors of the economy that have been the subject of highly publicized allegations of misconduct in recent years. In addition, many utility companies have been publicly criticized for their performance during recent natural disasters and weather related incidents. Adverse publicity of this nature may render legislatures, regulatory authorities, and tribunals less likely to view energy companies 135 such as DPL in a favorable light and may cause them to be susceptible to adverse outcomes with respect to decisions by such bodies. Because DPL is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of PHI, PHI can exercise substantial control over its dividend policy and business and operations. All of the members of DPLs board of directors, as well as many of DPLs executive officers, are officers of PHI. Among other decisions, DPLs board is responsible for decisions regarding payment of dividends, financing and capital raising activities, and acquisition and disposition of assets. Within the limitations of applicable law, including limitations imposed by PUHCA, and subject to the financial covenants under DPLs outstanding debt instruments, DPLs board of directors will base its decisions concerning the amount and timing of dividends, and other business decisions, on DPLs earnings, cash flow and capital structure, but may also take into account the business plans and financial requirements of PHI and its other subsidiaries. 136 THIS PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK. 137 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ATLANTIC CITY ELECTRIC COMPANY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Results of Operations discussion for ACE is presented only for the year ended December 31, 2004, in accordance with General Instruction I(2)(a). All dollar amounts are in millions. Operating Revenue 2004 2003 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $351.6 $350.5 $ 1.1 Default Supply Revenue 962.0 856.3 105.7 Other Electric Revenue 19.6 29.2 (9.6) Total Operating Revenue $1,333.2 $1,236.0 $ 97.2 The table above shows the amounts of Operating Revenue earned that is subject to price regulation (Regulated T&D Electric Revenue and Default Supply Revenue) and that which is not subject to price regulation (Other Electric Revenue). Regulated T&D (Transmission & Distribution) Electric Revenue includes revenue ACE receives for delivery of electricity to its customers. Default Supply Revenue (DSR), also known as Basic Generation Service (BGS) includes revenue ACE receives from the supply of electricity at regulated rates. The costs related to the supply of electricity are included in Fuel and Purchased Energy. Also included in DSR is revenue from non utility generators (NUGs), transition bond charges (TBC), market transition charges (MTC) and other restructuring related revenues (see Deferred Electric Service Cost). Other Revenue includes work and services performed on behalf of customers including other utilities, which is not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rents, late payments, and collection fees. Regulated T&D Electric Revenue Regulated T&D Electric Revenue increased by $1.1 million primarily due to the following: (i) $9.0 million increased average customer usage, (ii) $4.8 million increase in higher average effective rates, offset by, (iii) $5.5 million lower PJM network transmission revenue (offset in Fuel and Purchased Energy), (iv) $5.1 million lower transmission revenue related to increased customer migration, and (v) $2.1 million unfavorable weather impact. Delivered sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 were approximately 9,874,000 MwH compared to approximately 9,643,000 MwH for the comparable period in 2003. Cooling degree days decreased by .5% and heating degree days decreased by 7.9% for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the same period in 2003. Default Supply Revenue Default Supply Revenue is offset in operating expenses and has minimal earnings impact due to deferral accounting as a result of electric restructuring in New Jersey. The $105.7 million increase in DSR resulted from the following: (i) $83.1 million of higher wholesale energy revenues due to higher market prices in 2004, (ii) $76.3 million due to higher 138 effective rates as the result of an increase in BGS retail energy rates beginning in June 2004 and an increase in net NUG and MTC rates beginning in August 2003, (iii) $24.4 million of higher average customer use, partially offset by (iv) $68.9 million decrease related to increased customer migration, and (v) $9.2 million unfavorable weather impact. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, ACEs New Jersey customers served by an alternate supplier represented 22% of ACEs total load. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, ACEs New Jersey customers served by an alternate supplier represented 11% of ACEs total load. Default Supply sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 were approximately 7,669,000 MwH compared to approximately 8,597,000 MwH for the comparable period in 2003. Other Electric Revenue Other Electric Revenue decreased by $9.6 million primarily due to the following: (i) $5.2 million decrease in inter company revenue related to Deepwater tolling transaction between ACE and CEH, (ii) $3.2 million fuel oil sale in the first quarter of 2003, and (iii) $.6 million lower customer requested work. Operating Expenses Fuel and Purchased Energy Fuel and Purchased Energy increased by $28.0 million to $806.7 million in 2004 from $778.7 million in 2003. This increase was primarily due to: (i) $36.4 million higher average costs, the result of the new Default Supply rates for New Jersey beginning in June 2004 and offset by (ii) $8.4 million reduced PJM network transmission costs (partial offset in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue). Other Operation and Maintenance Other Operation and Maintenance decreased by $15.3 million to $192.7 million in 2004 from $208.0 million in 2003. The decrease primarily resulted from: (i) $10.2 million for Deepwater, plant transferred to CE in 2004; (ii) $6.8 million for reduced pension costs in 2004; (iii) $3.5 million related to billing system IT costs; (iv) $2.0 million primarily for Default Supply and Demand Side Management related costs; (v) $1.0 million incremental storm costs primarily related to one time charges as a result of Hurricane Isabel in September 2003, partially offset by (vi) $4.6 million severance costs in 2004; (vii) $1.5 million for electric system maintenance; (viii) $2.0 million for Sarbanes Oxley external compliance costs; and (ix) $.7 million for bad debt expense. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and Amortization expenses increased by $20.3 million to $132.8 million in 2004 from $112.5 million in 2003 primarily due to: (i) $12.8 million increase for amortization of bondable transition property as a result of additional transition bonds issued in December 2003; (ii) $3.8 million for the amortization of the deferred service costs balance which began in August 2003, (iii) $2.4 million increase for amortization of a regulatory tax asset related to New Jersey stranded costs, and (iv) $1.3 million other various items. 139 Other Taxes Other Taxes decreased by $3.7 million to $20.1 million in 2004 from $23.8 million in 2003. The decrease primarily resulted from a $3.3 million New Jersey delivery tax expense true up in 2004. Deferred Electric Service Costs Deferred Electric Service Costs (DESC), which relates only to ACE, increased by $43.3 million to $36.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from a $7.0 million credit to operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2003. The $43.3 million increase represents a net over recovery associated with New Jersey NUGs, MTC and other restructuring items. Additionally, the 2003 period contained a $27.5 million charge related to the New Jersey deferral disallowance regarding the procurement of fuel and purchased energy. Customers in New Jersey who do not choose a competitive supplier receive default electricity supply from suppliers selected through auctions approved by the NJBPU. ACEs rates for the recovery of these costs are reset annually. On ACEs balance sheet a regulatory asset includes an under recovery of $99.4 million as of December 31, 2004. This amount is net of a $46.1 million reserve on previously disallowed items under appe al. Gain on Sale of Assets The Gain on Sale of Assets increase of $14.7 million in 2004 is due to a settlement with the City of Vineland, New Jersey. During the second quarter of 2004, ACE and the City of Vineland finalized condemnation settlement under which ACE transferred to the City of Vineland its distribution assets within the geographical limits of the City of Vineland and related customer accounts. The transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately $14.7 million, which is recorded as a reduction to operating expenses in the line item entitled "gain on sale of assets" on the consolidated statements of earnings. Other Income (Expenses) Other Expenses increased by $3.0 million to a net expense of $52.4 million in 2004 from a net expense of $49.4 million in 2003. This increase is primarily due to the following: (i) $5.5 million increase in interest expense on Transition Bonds issued by ACE Funding due to additional transition bonds issued in December, 2003, partially offset by; (ii) $2.1 million decrease in income from customers to recover income tax expense on contributions in aid of construction. Preferred Stock Dividend Requirements Preferred Stock Dividend Requirements decreased by $1.8 million from 2003. This was attributable to SFAS No. 150, which requires that dividends on Mandatorily Redeemable Serial Preferred Stock declared subsequent to July 1, 2003, be recorded as interest expense. 140 Income Tax Expense ACEs effective tax rate for 2004 was 40% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference were state income taxes (net of federal benefit), changes in estimates related to tax liabilities of prior tax years subject to audit, partially offset by the flow through of Deferred Investment Tax Credits. ACEs effective tax rate for 2003 was 40% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference were state income taxes (net of federal benefit), changes in estimates related to tax liabilities of prior tax years subject to audit, partially offset by the flow through of Deferred Investment Tax Credits. Extraordinary Item In July 2003, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) approved the determination of stranded costs related to ACEs January 31, 2003, petition relating to its B.L. England generating facility. The NJBPU approved recovery of $149.5 million. As a result of the order, ACE reversed $10.0 million of accruals for the possible disallowances related to these stranded costs. The credit to income of $5.9 million is classified as an extraordinary gain in ACEs financial statements, since the original accrual was part of an extraordinary charge in conjunction with the accounting for competitive restructuring in 1999. RISK FACTORS The business of ACE is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the events or conditions identified below. The occurrence of one or more these events or conditions could have an adverse effect on the business of ACE, including, depending on the circumstances, its results of operations and financial condition. ACE is a public utility that is subject to substantial governmental regulation. If ACE receives unfavorable regulatory treatment, ACEs business could be negatively affected. ACEs utility business is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local regulatory agencies that significantly affects its operations. ACEs operations are regulated by the NJBPU with respect to, among other things, the rates it can charge retail customers for the delivery of electricity. In addition, the rates that ACE can charge for electricity transmission are regulated by FERC. ACE cannot change delivery or transmission rates without approval by the applicable regulatory authority. While the approved delivery and transmission rates are intended to permit ACE to recover its costs of service and earn a reasonable rate of return, ACEs profitability is affected by the rates it is able to charge. In addition, if the costs incurred by ACE in operating its transmission and distribution facilities exceed the allowed amounts for costs included in the approved rates, ACEs financial results will be adversely affected. ACE also is required to have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from governmental agencies that regulate its business. ACE believes that it has obtained or sought renewal of the material permits, approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations and that its business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, ACE is unable to predict the impact of future regulatory activities of 141 any of these agencies on its business. Changes in or reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations, or the imposition of new laws or regulations, may require ACE to incur additional expenses or to change the way it conducts its operations. The operating results of ACE fluctuate on a seasonal basis and can be adversely affected by changes in weather. ACEs electric utility business is seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on its operating performance. Demand for electricity is generally greater in the summer months associated with cooling and the winter months associated with heating as compared to other times of the year. Accordingly, ACE historically has generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer. ACEs facilities may not operate as planned or may require significant maintenance expenditures, which could decrease its revenues or increase its expenses. Operation of generation, transmission and distribution facilities involves many risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment, accidents, labor disputes and performance below expected levels. Older facilities and equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures for additions or upgrades to keep them operating at peak efficiency, to comply with changing environmental requirements, or to provide reliable operations. Natural disasters and weather related incidents, including tornadoes, hurricanes and snow and ice storms, also can disrupt generation, transmission and distribution delivery systems. Operation of generation, transmission and distribution facilities below expected capacity levels can reduce revenues and result in the incurrence of additional expenses that may not be recoverable from customers or through insurance. Furthermore, if ACE is unable to perf orm its contractual obligations for any of these reasons, it may incur penalties or damages. ACEs transmission facilities are interconnected with the facilities of other transmission facility owners whose actions could have a negative impact on the ACEs operations. The transmission facilities of ACE are directly interconnected with the transmission facilities of contiguous utilities and as such are part of an interstate power transmission grid. FERC has designated a number of regional transmission operators to coordinate the operation of portions of the interstate transmission grid. ACE is a member of PJM, which is the regional transmission operator that coordinates the movement of electricity in all or parts of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. ACE operates its transmission facilities under the direction and control of PJM. PJM and the other regional transmission operators have established sophisticated systems that are designed to ensure the reliability of the operation of transmission facilities and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impact on the operations of the other utilities. However, the system s put in place by PJM and the other regional transmission operators may not always be adequate to prevent problems at other utilities from causing service interruptions in the transmission facilities of ACE. If ACE were to suffer such a service interruption, it could have a negative impact on its business. 142 The cost of compliance with environmental laws is significant and new environmental laws may increase ACEs expenses. ACEs operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations, relating to air quality, water quality, spill prevention, waste management, natural resources, site remediation, and health and safety. These laws and regulations require ACE to incur expenses to, among other things, conduct site remediation and obtain permits. ACE also may be required to pay significant remediation costs with respect to third party sites. If ACE fails to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond its control, such failure could result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities and the need to expend significant sums to come into compliance. In addition, ACE incurs costs to obtain and comply with a variety of environmental permits, licenses, inspections and other approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if ACE fails to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, operations at affected facilities could be halted or subjected to additional costs. New environmental laws and regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, could impose more stringent limitations on ACEs operations or require it to incur significant additional costs. ACEs current compliance strategy may not successfully address the relevant standards and interpretations of the future. Changes in technology may adversely affect ACEs electricity delivery businesses Increased conservation efforts and advances in technology could reduce demand for electricity supply and distribution, which could adversely affect ACEs business. In addition, changes in technology also could alter the channels through which retail electric customers buy electricity, which could adversely affect ACEs business. Acts of terrorism could adversely affect ACEs business. The threat of or actual acts of terrorism may affect ACEs operations in unpredictable ways and may cause changes in the insurance markets, force ACE to increase security measures and cause disruptions of power markets. If any of ACEs generation, transmission or distribution facilities were to be a direct target, or an indirect casualty, of an act of terrorism, its operations could be adversely affected. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism also could affect the ability of ACE to raise needed capital. ACEs insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all casualty losses that it might incur. ACE currently has insurance coverage for its facilities and operations in amounts and with deductibles that it considers appropriate. However, there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, some risks, such as weather related casualties, may not be insurable. In the case of loss or damage to property, plant or equipment, there is no assurance that the insurance proceeds, if any, received will be sufficient to cover the entire cost of replacement or repair. 143 ACE may be adversely affected by economic conditions. Periods of slowed economic activity generally result in decreased demand for power, particularly by industrial and large commercial customers. As a consequence, recessions or other downturns in the economy may result in decreased revenues and cash flows for ACE. ACE is dependent on its ability to successfully access capital markets. An inability to access capital may adversely affect its business. ACE relies on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity and to satisfy its capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from its operations. Capital market disruptions, or a downgrade in ACEs credit ratings, would increase the cost of borrowing or could adversely affect its ability to access one or more financial markets. Disruptions to the capital markets could include, but are not limited to: recession or an economic slowdown; the bankruptcy of one or more energy companies; significant increases in the prices for oil or other fuel; a terrorist attack or threatened attacks; or a significant transmission failure. ACE may be required to, or may elect to, make significant cash contributions to the Retirement Plan. ACE follows the guidance of SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" in accounting for pension benefits under the Retirement Plan, a non contributory defined benefit plan in which ACEs employees participate. In accordance with these accounting standards, ACE makes assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. Changes in assumptions such as the use of a different discount rate or expected return on plan assets, affects the calculation of projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit obligation, reported pension liability on ACEs balance sheet, and reported annual net periodic pension benefit cost on ACEs income statement. Furthermore, as a result of actual pension plan experience being different from expected, the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) could be greater than the fair value of pension plan assets. If this were to occur, ACE could be required to recognize an additional minimum liability as prescribed by SFAS No. 87. The liability would be recorded as a reduction to common equity through a charge to Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), and would not affect net income for the year. The charge to OCI would be restored through common equity in future periods when the fair value of plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation. PHIs funding policy is to make cash contributions to the pension plan sufficient for plan assets to exceed the ABO, and avoid the recognition of an additional minimum liability. Use of alternative assumptions could also impact the expected future cash funding requirements for the Retirement Plan if it did not meet the minimum funding requirements of ERISA. 144 Energy companies are subject to adverse publicity, which may render ACE vulnerable to negative regulatory and litigation outcomes. The energy sector has been among the sectors of the economy that have been the subject of highly publicized allegations of misconduct in recent years. In addition, many utility companies have been publicly criticized for their performance during recent natural disasters and weather related incidents. Adverse publicity of this nature may render legislatures, regulatory authorities, and tribunals less likely to view energy companies such as ACE in a favorable light and may cause them to be susceptible to adverse outcomes with respect to decisions by such bodies. Because ACE is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of PHI, PHI can exercise substantial control over its dividend policy and business and operations. All of the members of ACEs board of directors, as well as many of ACEs executive officers, are officers of PHI. Among other decisions, ACEs board is responsible for decisions regarding payment of dividends, financing and capital raising activities, and acquisition and disposition of assets. Within the limitations of applicable law, including limitations imposed by PUHCA, and subject to the financial covenants under ACEs outstanding debt instruments, ACEs board of directors will base its decisions concerning the amount and timing of dividends, and other business decisions, on ACEs earnings, cash flow and capital structure, but may also take into account the business plans and financial requirements of PHI and its other subsidiaries. 145 THIS PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK. 146 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Pepco Holdings As of March 2003, Conectiv Energy ceased all proprietary trading activities, which generally consist of the entry into contracts to take a view of market direction, capture market price change, and put capital at risk. PHIs competitive energy segments are no longer engaged in proprietary trading; however, the market exposure under certain contracts entered into prior to cessation of proprietary trading activities was not eliminated due to the illiquid market environment to execute such elimination. These contracts will remain in place until they are terminated and their values are realized as they mature in 2005. The competitive energy segments actively engage in commodity risk management activities to reduce their financial exposure to changes in the value of their assets and obligations due to commodity price fluctuations. Certain of these risk management activities are conducted using instruments classified as derivatives under SFAS 133. In addition, the competitive energy segments also manage commodity risk with contracts that are not classified as derivatives. The competitive energy segments primary risk management objectives are to manage the spread between the cost of fuel used to operate their electric generation plants and the revenue received from the sale of the power produced by those plants and manage the spread between retail sales commitments and the cost of supply used to service those commitments in order to ensure stable and known minimum cash flows and fix favorable prices and margins when they become available. To a lesser exten t, Conectiv Energy also engages in market activities in an effort to profit from short term geographical price differentials in electricity prices among markets. PHI collectively refers to these energy market activities, including its commodity risk management activities, as "other energy commodity" activities and identifies this activity separate from that of the discontinued proprietary trading activity. PHIs risk management policies place oversight at the senior management level through the Corporate Risk Management Committee which has the responsibility for establishing corporate compliance requirements for the competitive energy segments energy market participation. PHI uses a value at risk (VaR) model to assess the market risk of its competitive energy segments other energy commodity activities and its remaining proprietary trading contracts. PHI also uses other measures to limit and monitor risk in its commodity activities, including limits on the nominal size of positions and periodic loss limits. VaR represents the potential mark to market loss on energy contracts or portfolios due to changes in market prices for a specified time period and confidence level. PHI estimates VaR using a delta gamma variance/ covariance model with a 95 percent, one tailed confidence level and assuming a one day holding period. Since VaR is an estimate , it is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur. 147 Value at Risk Associated with Energy Contracts For the Year Ended December 31, 2004 (Dollars in Millions) Proprietary Trading VaR (1) VaR for Energy Derivative Contracts (2) VaR for Competitive Energy Activity (3) 95% confidence level, one day holding period, one tailed(4) Period end $ 0.0 $ 4.0 $ 4.3 Average for the period $ 0.0 $ 6.5 $ 4.6 High $ 0.1 $11.5 $ 8.9 Low $ 0.0 $ 2.3 $ 2.1 Notes: (1) Includes all remaining proprietary trading contracts entered into prior to cessation of this activity prior to March 2003. (2) Includes all derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133, including proprietary trading contracts and derivatives associated with other energy commodity activities. (3) This column represents all energy derivative contracts, normal purchase & sales contracts, modeled generation output and fuel requirements and modeled customer load obligations for both the discontinued proprietary trading activity and the ongoing other energy commodity activities. (4) As VaR calculations are shown in a standard delta or delta/gamma closed form 95% 1 day holding period 1 tail normal distribution form, traditional statistical and financial methods can be employed to reconcile prior 10 K and 10 Q VaRs to the above approach. In this case, 5 day VaRs divided by the square root of 5 equal 1 day VaRs; and 99% 1 tail VaRs divided by 2.326 times 1.645 equal 95% 1 tail VaRs. Note that these methods of conversion are not valid for converting from 5 day or less holding periods to over 1 month holding periods and should not be applied to "non standard closed form" VaR calculations in any case. For additional quantitative and qualitative information on the fair value of energy contracts refer to Note 13, Use of Derivatives in Energy and Interest Rate Hedging Activities in Pepco Holdings Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The competitive energy segments portfolio of electric generating plants includes "mid merit" assets and peaking assets. Mid merit electric generating plants are typically combined cycle units that can quickly change their megawatt output level on an economic basis. These plants are generally operated during times when demand for electricity rises and power prices are higher. The competitive energy segments dynamically (economically) hedge both the estimated plant output and fuel requirements as the estimated levels of output and fuel needs change. Dynamic (or economic) hedge percentages include the estimated electricity output of and fuel requirements for the competitive energy segments generation plants that have been economically hedged and any associated financial or physical commodity contracts (including derivative contracts that are classified as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133, other derivative instruments, wholesale normal purchas e and sales contracts, and load service obligations). As of December 31, 2004, based on economic availability projections, 86% of generation output is economically hedged over the next 36 months. Fuel inputs for the same 36 month period are 58% hedged. 148 This table provides information on the competitive energy segments credit exposure, net of collateral, to wholesale counterparties. Schedule of Credit Risk Exposure on Competitive Wholesale Energy Contracts (Dollars in Millions) December 31, 2004 Rating (1) Exposure Before Credit Collateral (2) Credit Collateral (3) Net Exposure Number of Counterparties Greater Than 10% * Net Exposure of Counterparties Greater Than 10% Investment Grade $260.9 $21.4 $239.5 2 $127.6 Non Investment Grade 4.3 3.0 1.3 Split rating No External Ratings 17.1 17.1 Credit reserves $ .6 (1) Investment Grade primarily determined using publicly available credit ratings of the counterparty. If the counterparty has provided a guarantee by a higher rated entity (e.g., its parent), it is determined based upon the rating of its guarantor. Included in "Investment Grade" are counterparties with a minimum Standard & Poors or Moodys rating of BBB or Baa3, respectively. If it has a split rating (i.e., rating not uniform between major rating agencies), it is presented separately. (2) Exposure before credit collateral includes the MTM energy contract net assets for open/unrealized transactions, the net receivable/payable for realized transactions and net open positions for contracts not subject to MTM. Amounts due from counterparties are offset by liabilities payable to those counterparties to the extent that legally enforceable netting arrangements are in place. Thus, this column presents the net credit exposure to counterparties after reflecting all allowable netting, but before considering collateral held. (3) Credit collateral the face amount of cash deposits, letters of credit and performance bonds received from counterparties, not adjusted for probability of default, and if applicable property interests (including oil and gas reserves). * Using a percentage of the total exposure QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES Pepco Holdings Market Risk Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. Certain of Pepco Holdings financial instruments are exposed to market risk in the form of interest rate risk, equity price risk, commodity risk, and credit and nonperformance risk. Pepco Holdings management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. Management reviews any open positions in accordance with strict policies in order to limit exposure to market risk. Interest Rate Risk Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries floating rate debt is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. Pepco Holdings manages interest rates through the use of fixed and, to a lesser extent, variable rate debt. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates on the annual interest costs for short term and variable rate debt was approximately $1.7 million as of December 31, 2004. 149 Commodity Price Risk Pepco Holdings is at risk for a decrease in market liquidity to levels that affect its capability to execute its commodity participation strategies. PHI believes the commodity markets to be sufficiently liquid to support its market participation. Conectivs participation in wholesale energy markets includes marketing, trading, and arbitrage activities, which expose Conectiv to commodity market risk. To the extent Conectiv has net open positions, controls are in place that are intended to keep risk exposures within management approved risk tolerance levels. Conectiv engages in commodity hedging activities to minimize the risk of market fluctuations associated with the purchase and sale of energy commodities (natural gas, petroleum, coal and electricity). The majority of these hedges relate to the procurement of fuel for its power plants, fixing the cash flows from the plant output, and securing power for electric load service. Conectivs hedging activities are conducted using derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, which are designed to reduce the volatility on future cash flows. Conectivs energy commodity hedging objectives, in accordance with its risk management pol icy, are primarily the assurance of stable and known cash flows and the fixing of favorable prices and margins when they become available. Conectiv manages to the objective of hedging the variability in future cash flows for forecasted energy output from its generation assets at 75% of such forecasted output over a period of 36 months. As of December 2004, Conectivs average forecasted hedge position for the forward 36 months was projected to meet that objective. Credit and Nonperformance Risk Certain of PHIs subsidiaries agreements may be subject to credit losses and nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, PHI anticipates that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the agreements. PHIs subsidiaries attempt to minimize credit risk exposure to wholesale energy counterparties through, among other things, formal credit policies, regular assessment of counterparty creditworthiness that results in the establishment of a credit limit for each counterparty, monitoring procedures that include stress testing, the use of standard agreements which allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty and collateral requirements under certain circumstances, and has established reserves for credit losses. As of December 31, 2004, credit exposure to wholesale energy counterparties was weighted 92% with investment grade counterparties, 6% with counterparties without external credit quality ratings, and 2% with non investment grade counterparties. Pepco Market Risk Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. Certain of Pepcos financial instruments are exposed to market risk in the form of interest rate risk, equity price risk, commodity risk, and credit and nonperformance risk. Pepcos management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. Management reviews any open positions in accordance with strict policies in order to limit exposure to market risk. 150 Interest Rate Risk Pepcos debt is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. Pepco manages interest rates through the use of fixed and, to a lesser extent, variable rate debt. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates on the annual interest costs for short term debt was approximately $.3 million as of December 31, 2004. DPL Market Risk Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. Certain of DPLs financial instruments are exposed to market risk in the form of interest rate risk, equity price risk, commodity risk, and credit and nonperformance risk. DPLs management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. Management reviews any open positions in accordance with strict policies in order to limit exposure to market risk. Interest Rate Risk DPLs debt is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. DPL manages interest rates through the use of fixed and, to a lesser extent, variable rate debt. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates on the annual interest costs for short term debt was approximately $.5 million as of December 31, 2004. ACE Market Risk Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. Certain of ACEs financial instruments are exposed to market risk in the form of interest rate risk, equity price risk, commodity risk, and credit and nonperformance risk. ACEs management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. Management reviews any open positions in accordance with strict policies in order to limit exposure to market risk. Interest Rate Risk ACEs debt is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. ACE manages interest rates through the use of fixed and, to a lesser extent, variable rate debt. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates on the annual interest costs for short term debt was approximately $.2 million as of December 31, 2004. 151
