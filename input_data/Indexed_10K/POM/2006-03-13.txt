RESTATEMENT Pepco Holdings restated its previously reported consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2004 and for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the quarterly financial information for the first three quarters in 2005, and all quarterly periods in 2004, to correct the accounting for certain deferred compensation arrangements. The restatement includes the correction of other errors for the same periods, primarily relating to unbilled revenue, taxes, and various accrual accounts, which were considered by management to be immaterial. These other errors would not themselves have required a restatement absent the restatement to correct the accounting for deferred compensation arrangements. This restatement was required solely because the cumulative impact of the correction, if recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005, would have been material to that periods reported net income. See Note 15 "Restatement" for further discussion. GENERAL OVERVIEW Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI or Pepco Holdings) is a public utility holding company that, through its operating subsidiaries, is engaged primarily in two principal business operations: electricity and natural gas delivery (Power Delivery), and competitive energy generation, marketing and supply (Competitive Energy). The Power Delivery business is the largest component of PHIs business. For each of the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, the operating revenues of the Power Delivery business (including intercompany amounts) were equal to 58%, 61%, and 55%, respectively, of PHIs consolidated operating revenues, and the operating income of the Power Delivery business (including income from intercompany transactions) was equal to 74%, 70%, and 82% of PHIs consolidated operating income, respectively. The Power Delivery business consists primarily of the transmission, distribution and default supply of electric power, which was responsible for 94%, 95%, and 95% of Power Deliverys operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, and the distribution of natural gas, which contributed 6%, 5%, and 5% of Power Deliverys operating revenues over the same periods, respectively. Power Delivery represents one operati ng segment for financial reporting purposes. The Power Delivery business is conducted by three regulated utility subsidiaries: Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco), Delmarva Power & Light Company (DPL) and Atlantic City Electric Company (ACE). Each of these companies is a regulated public utility in the jurisdictions that comprise its service territory. Each company is responsible for the distribution of electricity and, in the case of DPL, natural gas in its service territory, for which it is paid tariff rates established by the local public service commissions. Each company also supplies electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territory who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier. The regulatory term for this supply service varies by jurisdiction as follows: 32 Delaware Provider of Last Resort service (POLR) before May 1, 2006 Standard Offer Service (SOS) on and after May 1, 2006 District of Columbia SOS Maryland SOS New Jersey Basic Generation Service (BGS) Virginia Default Service PHI and its subsidiaries refer to this supply service in each of the jurisdictions generally as Default Electricity Supply. Pepco, DPL and ACE are also responsible for the transmission of wholesale electricity into and across their service territories. The rates each company is permitted to charge for the wholesale transmission of electricity are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The profitability of the Power Delivery business depends on its ability to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on its capital investments through the rates it is permitted to charge. Power Deliverys operating revenue and income are seasonal, and weather patterns may have a material impact on operating results. The Competitive Energy business provides competitive generation, marketing and supply of electricity and gas, and related energy management services primarily in the mid Atlantic region. These operations are conducted through subsidiaries of Conectiv Energy Holding Company (collectively, Conectiv Energy) and Pepco Energy Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, Pepco Energy Services), each of which is treated as a separate operating segment for financial reporting purposes. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, the operating revenues of the Competitive Energy business (including intercompany amounts) were equal to 51%, 50%, and 55%, respectively, of PHIs consolidated operating revenues, and the operating income of the Competitive Energy business (including operating income from intercompany transactions) was 16% and 19% of PHIs consolidated operating income for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2003, P HIs Competitive Energy operations incurred an operating loss equal to 20% of PHIs consolidated operating income. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, amounts equal to 14%, 16% and 16%, respectively, of the operating revenues of the Competitive Energy business were attributable to electric energy and capacity, and natural gas sold to the Power Delivery segment. 33 Conectiv Energy provides wholesale electric power, capacity and ancillary services in the wholesale markets administered by PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM) and also supplies electricity to other wholesale market participants under long and short term bilateral contracts. PHI refers to these wholesale supply operations as Merchant Generation. Conectiv Energy has a power supply agreement under which it provides DPL with all of the electric power needed for distribution to its Default Electricity Supply customers in Delaware and Virginia. Conectiv Energy also supplies electric power to satisfy a portion of ACEs Default Electricity Supply load and DPLs Maryland Default Electricity Supply load, as well as Default Electricity Supply load shares of other mid Atlantic utilities. PHI refers to the supply of energy by Conectiv Energy to utilities to fulfill their Default Electricity Supply obligations as Full Requirements Load Service. Conectiv Energy obtains the electricity required to meet its Mercha nt Generation and Full Requirements Load Service power supply obligations from its own generation plants, under bilateral contract purchases from other wholesale market participants and from purchases in the PJM wholesale market. Conectiv Energy also sells natural gas and fuel oil to very large end users and to wholesale market participants under bilateral agreements. PHI refers to these sales operations as Other Power, Oil & Gas Marketing. Pepco Energy Services sells retail electricity and natural gas and provides integrated energy management services, primarily in the mid Atlantic region, and its subsidiaries own and operate generation plants located in PJM. Pepco Energy Services also provides high voltage construction and maintenance services to utilities and other customers throughout the United States and low voltage electric and telecommunication construction and maintenance services primarily in the Washington, D.C. area. Conectiv Energys primary objective is to maximize the value of its generation fleet by leveraging its operational and fuel flexibilities. Pepco Energys primary objective is to capture retail energy supply and service opportunities primarily in the mid Atlantic region. The financial results of the Competitive Energy business can be significantly affected by wholesale and retail energy prices, the cost of fuel to operate the Conectiv Energy plants, and the cost of purchased energy necessary to meet its power supply obligations. In order to lower its financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, Conectiv Energy entered into an agreement consisting of a series of energy contracts with an international investment banking firm. This agreement is designed to hedge approximately 50% of Conectiv Energys generation output and approximately 50% of its supply obligations, with the intention of providing Conectiv Energy with a more predictable earnings stream during the term of the agreement. This agreement consists of two major components: (i) a fixed price energy supply hedge that will be used to reduce Conectiv Energys financial exposure under its current Default Electricity Supply commitment to DPL which extends through April 2006 and (ii) a generation off take agreement under which Conectiv Energy will receive a fixed monthly payment from the counterparty, and the counterparty will receive the profit realized from the sale of approximately 50% of the electricity generated by Conectiv Energ ys plants (excluding the Edge Moor facility). Conectiv Energy has taken steps to hedge its generation output and supply obligations after May 2006 by entering into various new standard product supply agreements, full requirement supply contracts, bilateral energy and capacity sales agreements and various fuel and power supply transactions to hedge the related fuel and power requirements. 34 The Competitive Energy business, like the Power Delivery business, is seasonal, and therefore weather patterns can have a material impact on operating results. Over the last several years, PHI has discontinued its investments in non energy related businesses, and has sold its aircraft investments and its 50% interest in Starpower Communications LLC (Starpower). Through its subsidiary, Potomac Capital Investment Corporation (PCI), PHI continues to maintain a portfolio of cross border energy sale leaseback transactions with a book value at December 31, 2005 of approximately $1.3 billion. This activity constitutes a fourth operating segment, which is designated as "Other Non Regulated," for financial reporting purposes. BUSINESS STRATEGY PHIs business strategy is to remain a regional diversified energy delivery utility and competitive energy services company focused on value creation and operational excellence. This strategy has three primary components: Achieving growing earnings in the Power Delivery business by focusing on infrastructure investments and constructive regulatory outcomes, while maintaining a high level of operational excellence. Supplementing PHIs utility earnings growth through competitive energy businesses that focus primarily on serving the competitive wholesale and retail markets in PJM. Strengthening PHIs credit profile through continued debt reduction efforts.

This expense is primarily offset in Default Supply Revenue. Competitive Energy Business Conectiv Energy The following table divides Conectiv Energys Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales among its major business activities. 2005 2004 Change Merchant Generation $ 418.6 $ 444.3 $ (25.7) Full Requirements Load Service 857.7 933.1 (75.4) Other Power, Oil and Gas Marketing Services 1,068.1 753.5 314.6 Total Conectiv Energy Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales $ 2,344.4 $ 2,130.9 $ 213.5 The totals presented include $217.7 million and $245.4 million of affiliate transactions for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The impact of Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales changes with respect to the Conectiv Energy component of the Competitive Energy business are encompassed within the discussion below under the heading "Conectiv Energy Gross Margin." 44 Conectiv Energy Gross Margin Management believes that gross margin (Revenue less Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales) is a better comparative measurement of the primary activities of Conectiv Energy than Revenue and Fuel and Purchased Energy by themselves. Gross margin is a more stable comparative measurement and it is used extensively by management in internal reporting. The following is a summary of gross margins by activity type (Millions of dollars): December 31, 2005 2004 Megawatt Hour Supply (Megawatt Hours) Merchant Generation output sold into market 5,595,149 5,161,682 Operating Revenue: Merchant Generation $ 675.7 $ 684.5 Full Requirements Load Service 848.7 960.2 Other Power, Oil, and Gas Marketing 1,079.2 765.1 Total Operating Revenue $2,603.6 $2,409.8 Cost of Sales: Merchant Generation $ 418.6 $ 444.3 Full Requirements Load Service 857.7 933.1 Other Power, Oil, and Gas Marketing 1,068.1 753.5 Total Cost of Sales $2,344.4 $2,130.9 Gross Margin: Merchant Generation $ 257.1 $ 240.2 Full Requirements Load Service (9.0) 27.1 Other Power, Oil and Gas Marketing 11.1 11.6 Total Gross Margin $ 259.2 $ 278.9 Warmer weather during the summer months of 2005 and continued PJM load growth resulted in increased demand for power and higher prices for power, causing higher Merchant Generation output and an increase in the gross margin. The higher gross margin from the sale of generation output was partially offset by negative hedge results. The 2005 decrease in the Lower Full Requirements Load Service gross margin resulted from higher fuel and energy prices during 2005. Full Requirements Load Service is hedged by both contract purchases with third parties and by the output of the generation plants operated by Conectiv Energy. Other Power, Oil and Gas Marketing margins decreased because of a one time gain of $8.7 million on a group of coal contracts in 2004. This was partially offset by higher margin sales for oil marketing ($5.6 million) and gas marketing ($2.0 million) during the fourth quarter of 2005. 45 Pepco Energy Services The following table presents Pepco Energy Services Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services cost of sales. 2005 2004 Change Pepco Energy Services $ 1,357.5 $ 1,064.4 $ 293.1 The increase in Pepco Energy Services fuel and purchased energy and other services cost of sales of $293.1 million resulted from (i) higher volumes of electricity purchased at higher prices in 2005 to serve commercial and industrial retail customers, (ii) higher fuel and operating costs for the Benning and Buzzard Point power plants in 2005 due to higher electric generation that resulted from warmer weather in 2005, and (iii) higher energy services activities in 2005 resulting from contracts signed with customers under which Pepco Energy Services provides services for energy efficiency and high voltage installation projects. Other Operation and Maintenance A detail of PHIs other operation and maintenance expense is as follows: 2005 2004 Change Power Delivery $ 643.1 $ 623.9 $ 19.2 Conectiv Energy 107.7 103.8 3.9 Pepco Energy Services 71.2 71.5 (.3) Other Non Regulated 6.1 6.9 (.8) Corporate and Other (12.4) (9.5) (2.9) Total $ 815.7 $ 796.6 $ 19.1 PHIs other operation and maintenance increased by $19.1 million to $815.7 million for the year ended 2005 from $796.6 million for the year ended 2004 primarily due to the following: (i) a $10.3 million increase in employee related costs, (ii) 9.0 million increase in corporate services allocation, (iii) $3.9 million increase due to the write off of software, (iv) $3.2 million increase due to mutual assistance work related to storm damage in 2005 (offset in Other Electric Revenues), and (v) $2.1 million increase in maintenance expenses, partially offset by (vi) $4.9 million reduction in the uncollectible account reserve to reflect the amount expected to be collected on Pepcos Pre Petition Claims with Mirant and (vii) a $5.5 million decrease in PJM administrative expenses. 46 Depreciation and Amortization PHIs depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by $17.9 million to $422.6 million in 2005 from $440.5 million in 2004. The decrease is primarily due to a $7.6 million decrease from a change in depreciation technique resulting from a 2005 final rate order from the NJBPU and a $4.8 million decrease due to a change in the estimated useful lives of Conectiv Energys generation assets. Other Taxes Other taxes increased by $30.8 million to $342.2 million in 2005 from $311.4 million in 2004 due to higher pass throughs, mainly as the result of a county surcharge rate increase (primarily offset in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue). Deferred Electric Service Costs Deferred Electric Service Costs, which relates only to ACE, increased by $83.9 million to $120.2 million in 2005, from $36.3 million in 2004. At December 31, 2005, DESC represents the net expense or over recovery associated with New Jersey NUGs, market transition change (MTC) and other restructuring items. The $83.9 million increase represents (i) $77.1 million net over recovery associated with New Jersey BGS, NUGS, market transition charges and other restructuring items, and (ii) $4.5 million in regulatory disallowances (net of amounts previously reserved) associated with the April 2005 NJBPU settlement agreement. ACEs rates for the recovery of those costs are reset annually and the rates will vary from year to year. At December 31, 2005, ACEs balance sheet included as a regulatory liability an over recovery of $40.9 million with respect to these items, which is net of a $47.3 million reserve for items disallowed by the NJBPU in a ruling that is under appeal. Gain on Sales of Assets Pepco Holdings recorded a Gain on Sales of Assets of $86.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $30.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The $86.8 million gain in 2005 primarily consists of: (i) a $68.1 million gain from the 2005 sale of non utility land owned by Pepco located at Buzzard Point in the District of Columbia, and (ii) a $13.3 million gain recorded by PCI from proceeds related to the final liquidation of a financial investment that was written off in 2001. The $30.0 million gain in 2004 consists of: (i) a $14.7 million gain from the 2004 condemnation settlement with the City of Vineland relating to the transfer of ACEs distribution assets and customer accounts to the city, (ii) a $6.6 million gain from the 2004 sale of land, and (iii) an $8.3 million gain on the 2004 sale of aircraft investments by PCI. Gain on Settlement of Claims with Mirant The Gain on Settlement of Claims with Mirant of $70.5 million represents a settlement (net of customer sharing) with Mirant in the fourth quarter of 2005, of the Pepco TPA Claim ($70 million gain) and a Pepco asbestos claim against the Mirant bankruptcy estate ($.5 million gain). 47 Other Income (Expenses) Other expenses (which are net of other income) decreased by $55.9 million to $285.5 million in 2005 from $341.4 million in 2004, primarily due to the following: (i) a decrease in net interest expense of $35.7 million, which primarily resulted from a $23.6 million decrease due to less debt outstanding during the 2005 period and a decrease of $12.8 million of interest expense that was recorded by Conectiv Energy in 2004 related to costs associated with the prepayment of debt related to the Bethlehem mid merit facility, (ii) an $11.2 million impairment charge on the Starpower investment that was recorded during 2004, (iii) income of $7.9 million received by PCI in 2005 from the sale and liquidation of energy investments, and (iv) income of $3.9 million in 2005 from cash distributions from a joint owned co generation facility, partially offset by (v) an impairment charge of $4.1 million in 2005 related to a Conectiv Energy investment in a jointly owned generation project, and (v i) a pre tax gain of $11.2 million on a distribution from a co generation joint venture that was recognized by Conectiv Energy during the second quarter of 2004. Income Tax Expense Pepco Holdings effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 41% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference were state income taxes (net of federal benefit), the flow through of certain book/tax depreciation differences, and changes in estimates related to tax liabilities of prior tax years subject to audit, partially offset by the flow through of Deferred Investment Tax Credits and tax benefits related to certain leveraged leases. Pepco Holdings effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2004 was 39% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference were state income taxes (net of federal benefit), the flow through of certain book/tax depreciation differences, and the settlement with the IRS on certain non lease financial assets, partially offset by the flow through of Deferred Investment Tax Credits and tax benefits related to certain leveraged leases. Extraordinary Items On April 19, 2005, ACE, the staff of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU), the New Jersey Ratepayer Advocate, and active intervenor parties agreed on a settlement in ACEs electric distribution rate case. As a result of this settlement, ACE reversed $15.2 million in accruals related to certain deferred costs that are now deemed recoverable. The after tax credit to income of $9.0 million is classified as an extraordinary gain in the 2005 financial statements since the original accrual was part of an extraordinary charge in conjunction with the accounting for competitive restructuring in 1999. 48 The accompanying results of operations discussion is for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. All amounts in the tables (except sales and customers) are in millions. Operating Revenue A detail of the components of PHIs consolidated operating revenue is as follows: 2004 2003 Change Power Delivery $4,377.7 $4,015.7 $362.0 Conectiv Energy 2,409.8 2,857.5 (447.7) Pepco Energy Services 1,166.6 1,126.2 40.4 Other Non Regulated 87.9 100.1 (12.2) Corporate and Other (818.9) (830.8) 11.9 Total Operating Revenue $7,223.1 $7,268.7 $(45.6) Power Delivery Business The following table categorizes Power Deliverys operating revenue by type of revenue. 2004 2003 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $1,566.6 $1,521.0 $45.6 Default Supply Revenue 2,514.7 2,206.1 308.6 Other Electric Revenue 67.8 97.6 (29.8) Total Electric Operating Revenue 4,149.1 3,824.7 324.4 Regulated Gas Revenue 169.7 150.2 19.5 Other Gas Revenue 58.9 40.8 18.1 Total Gas Operating Revenue 228.6 191.0 37.6 Total Power Delivery Operating Revenue $4,377.7 $4,015.7 $362.0 Electric Operating Revenue Regulated T&D Electric Revenue 2004 2003 Change Residential $ 597.7 $ 576.2 $21.5 Commercial 692.3 674.7 17.6 Industrial 37.4 41.0 (3.6) Other (Includes PJM) 239.2 229.1 10.1 Total Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $1,566.6 $1,521.0 $45.6 49 Regulated T&D Electric Sales (Gwh) 2004 2003 Change Residential 17,759 17,147 612 Commercial 28,448 27,648 800 Industrial 4,471 4,874 (403) Total Regulated T&D Electric Sales 50,678 49,669 1,009 Regulated T&D Electric Customers (000s) 2004 2003 Change Residential 1,567 1,547 20 Commercial 193 191 2 Industrial 2 2 Total Regulated T&D Electric Customers 1,762 1,740 22 Regulated T&D Electric Sales, as measured on a Gwh basis, increased by 2% in 2004, driven by residential and commercial customer classes. Regulated T&D Revenue increased by $45.6 million primarily due to the following: (i) $14.4 million increase due to growth and average customer usage, (ii) $4.8 million increase due to higher average effective rates, (iii) $9.1 million due to weather, and (iv) $39.9 million increase in tax pass throughs, principally a county surcharge (offset in Other Taxes expense). These increases were offset by (v) $20.5 million decrease primarily related to PJM network transmission revenue and the impact of customer choice, and (vi) $2.1 million related to a Delaware competitive transition charge that ended in 2003. Cooling Degree Days increased by 11.0% and heating degree days decreased by 6.3% for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to the same period in 2003. Default Electricity Supply Default Supply Revenue 2004 2003 Change Residential $ 993.6 $ 875.2 $118.4 Commercial 1,060.9 946.4 114.5 Industrial 140.7 156.1 (15.4) Other (Includes PJM) 319.5 228.4 91.1 Total Default Supply Revenue $2,514.7 $2,206.1 $308.6 Default Electricity Supply Sales (Gwh) 2004 2003 Change Residential 16,775 16,048 727 Commercial 19,203 18,134 1,069 Industrial 2,292 2,882 (590) Other 226 94 132 Total Default Electricity Supply Sales 38,496 37,158 1,338 50 Default Electricity Supply Customers (000s) 2004 2003 Change Residential 1,509 1,460 49 Commercial 178 175 3 Industrial 2 2 Other 2 1 1 Total Default Electricity Supply Customers 1,691 1,638 53 Default Supply Revenue increased $308.6 million primarily due to the following: (i) $109.2 million as the result of higher retail energy rates, the result of effective rate increases in Delaware beginning October 2003 and in Maryland beginning in June and July 2004, (ii) $92.3 million primarily due to a reduction in customer migration in D.C., (iii) $83.1 million increase in wholesale energy prices as the result of higher market prices in 2004, and (iv) $24.4 million increase in average customer usage. Other Electric Revenue decreased $29.8 million primarily due to a $43.0 million decrease that resulted from the expiration on December 31, 2003 of a contract to supply electricity to Delaware Municipal Electric Corporation (DMEC). This decrease was partially offset by a $14.0 million increase in customer requested work (related costs in Operations and Maintenance expense). Gas Operating Revenue Regulated Gas Revenue 2004 2003 Change Residential $ 100.2 $ 88.8 $11.4 Commercial 56.7 47.7 9.0 Industrial 8.3 9.2 (.9) Transportation and Other 4.5 4.5 Total Regulated Gas Revenue $169.7 $150.2 $19.5 Regulated Gas Sales (Bcf) 2004 2003 Change Residential 8.7 9.0 (.3) Commercial 5.5 5.5 Industrial 1.2 1.6 (.4) Transportation and Other 6.2 6.8 (.6) Total Regulated Gas Sales 21.6 22.9 (1.3) 51 Regulated Gas Customers (000s) 2004 2003 Change Residential 109 108 1 Commercial 9 9 Industrial Transportation and Other Total Regulated Gas Customers 118 117 1 Regulated Gas Revenue increased $19.5 million principally due to the following: (i) $21.0 million increase in the Gas Cost Rate due to higher natural gas commodity costs, effective November 1, 2003, (ii) $8.2 million increase in Gas Base Rates due to higher operating expenses and cost of capital, effective December 9, 2003, and (iii) $2.0 million true up adjustment to unbilled revenues in 2003. These increases were partially offset by (iv) $9.4 million decrease due to 2003 being significantly colder than normal, and (v) $2.9 million reduction related to lower industrial sales. Heating degree days decreased 7.1% for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to the same period in 2003. Other Gas Revenue increased $18.1 million largely related to an increase in off system sales revenues of $17.3 million. The gas sold off system was made available by warmer winter weather and reduced customer demand. Competitive Energy Businesses Conectiv Energy The following table divides Conectiv Energys operating revenues among its major business activities. 2004 2003 Change Merchant Generation $ 684.5 $ 540.2 $ 144.3 Full Requirements Load Service 960.2 1,630.3 (670.1) Other Power, Oil and Gas Marketing Services 765.1 687.0 78.1 Total Conectiv Energy Operating Revenue $2,409.8 $2,857.5 $(447.7) The totals presented include $820.3 million and $822.1 million of affiliate transactions for 2004 and 2003, respectively. The impact of revenue changes with respect to the Conectiv Energy component of the Competitive Energy business are encompassed within the discussion below under the heading "Conectiv Energy Gross Margin." Pepco Energy Services The following table presents Pepco Energy Services operating revenues. 52 2004 2003 Change Pepco Energy Services $ 1,166.6 $ 1,126.2 $ 40.4 The increase in Pepco Energy Services operating revenue of $40.4 million resulted from higher volumes of electricity sold to customers in 2004 at more favorable prices than in 2003, partially offset by a decrease in natural gas revenues. Operating Expenses Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales A detail of PHIs consolidated Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales is as follows: 2004 2003 Change Power Delivery $2,524.2 $2,295.4 $228.8 Conectiv Energy 2,130.9 2,696.1 (565.2) Pepco Energy Services 1,064.4 1,033.1 31.3 Corporate and Other (823.3) (820.8) (2.5) Total $4,896.2 $5,203.8 $(307.6) Power Delivery Business Power Deliverys Fuel and Purchased Energy costs increased by $228.8 million primarily due to the following: (i) a $212.9 million increase related to higher average energy costs, the result of new Default Supply rates for Maryland beginning in June and July 2004 and for New Jersey beginning in June 2004, and less customer migration primarily in D.C., (ii) $45.1 million higher costs due to the increased cost of electricity supply under the Amended Settlement Agreement and Release with Mirant, effective October 2003, and (iii) a $30.2 million increase for gas commodity purchases, partially offset by (iv) $43.0 million related to the DMEC 2003 contract expiration, and (v) a $14.5 million reserve recorded in September 2003 to reflect a potential exposure related to a pre petition receivable from Mirant for which Pepco filed a creditors claim in the bankruptcy proceedings. Competitive Energy Businesses Conectiv Energy The following table categorizes Conectiv Energys Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales into major profit centers. 2004 2003 Change Merchant Generation $ 444.3 $ 356.5 $ 87.8 Full Requirements Load Service 933.1 1,591.9 (658.8) Other Power, Oil & Gas Marketing Services 753.5 747.7 5.8 Total Conectiv Energy Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales $2,130.9 $2,696.1 $(565.2) 53 Totals presented include $245.4 million and $161.1 million of affiliate transactions for 2004 and 2003, respectively. The impact of Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales changes for Conectiv Energys component of the Competitive Energy business is detailed within the discussion below under the heading "Conectiv Energy Gross Margin." Conectiv Energy Gross Margin Management believes that gross margin is a better comparative measurement of the primary activities of Conectiv Energy than Revenue and Fuel and Purchased Energy by themselves. Gross margin is a more stable comparative measurement and it is used extensively by management in internal reporting. The following is a summary of gross margins by activity type (Millions of dollars): December 31, 2004 2003 Megawatt Hour Supply (Megawatt Hours) Merchant Generation output sold into market 5,161,682 5,261,878 Operating Revenue: Merchant Generation $ 684.5 $ 540.2 Full Requirements Load Service 960.2 1,630.3 Other Power, Oil, and Gas Marketing 765.1 687.0 Total Operating Revenue $2,409.8 $2,857.5 Cost of Sales: Merchant Generation $ 444.3 $ 356.5 Full Requirements Load Service 933.1 1,591.9 Other Power, Oil, and Gas Marketing 753.5 747.7 Total Cost of Sales $2,130.9 $2,696.1 Gross Margin: Merchant Generation $ 240.2 $ 183.7 Full Requirements Load Service 27.1 38.4 Other Power, Oil and Gas Marketing 11.6 (60.7) Total Gross Margin $ 278.9 $ 161.4 The higher Generation gross margin in 2004 was due to the addition of new more efficient combined cycle generation at Bethlehem (which lowered fuel cost and increased Mwhs sold), unit flexibility (which increased margin by providing quick standard controls over unit running time), increased fuel switching (which generated fuel savings) and nuclear unit outages during the 4th quarter of 2004 (which increased output and price for power in eastern PJM). The higher margins were partially offset by cooler than normal summer weather which resulted in lower unit output in 2004. Conectiv Energys power plants achieved a substantial portion of the increase ($18.9 million) during the month of December 2004 due to unplanned nuclear outages in the region. The lower Full Requirements Load Service gross margin resulted from the termination of various full requirements load contracts and related power hedges in 2003 which contained 54 favorable margins. This was partially offset by higher POLR rates in 2004 and lower cost of sales. Other Power, Oil and Gas Marketing margins increased primarily because 2003 results included proprietary trading losses totaling $44 million. In addition, 2004 contained a substantial coal contract gain. Pepco Energy Services The following table presents Pepco Energy Services Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services cost of sales. 2004 2003 Change Pepco Energy Services $ 1,064.4 $ 1,033.1 $ 31.3 The increase in Pepco Energy Services fuel and purchased energy and other services cost of sales of $31.3 million resulted from higher volumes of electricity purchased in 2004 to serve customers, partially offset by a decrease in volumes of natural gas purchased in 2004 to serve customers. Other Operation and Maintenance PHIs other operation and maintenance increased by $25.2 million to $796.6 million in 2004 from $771.4 million in 2003 primarily due to (i) $12.1 million of customer requested work (offset in Other Electric Revenue), (ii) $10.6 million higher electric system operation and maintenance costs, (iii) $9.4 million in Sarbanes Oxley external compliance costs, and (iv) $12.8 million in severance costs, partially offset by (v) $10.6 million incremental storm costs primarily related to Hurricane Isabel in September 2003. Depreciation and Amortization PHIs depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $18.4 million to $440.5 million in 2004 from $422.1 million in 2003 primarily due to a $17.0 million increase attributable to the Power Delivery business resulting from (i) a $12.8 million increase for amortization of New Jersey bondable transition property as a result of additional transitional bonds issued in December 2003, (ii) $3.8 million for the amortization of the New Jersey deferred service costs balance which began in August 2003, and (iii) a $2.4 million increase for amortization of a regulatory tax asset related to New Jersey stranded costs. Additionally, depreciation expense attributable to the Competitive Energy business increased by $5.9 million from 2003 due to a full year of depreciation expense during 2004 at Conectiv Energys Bethlehem facility. Other Taxes Other taxes increased by $39.2 million to $311.4 million in 2004 from $272.2 million in 2003. This increase primarily resulted from a $30.1 million increase attributable to the Power Delivery business due to higher county surcharge pass throughs of $33.9 million and $3.6 million higher gross receipts/delivery taxes (offset in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue). 55 Deferred Electric Service Costs Deferred Electric Service Costs (DESC), which relates only to ACE, increased by $43.3 million to $36.3 million in 2004 from a $7.0 million operating expense credit in 2003. At December 31, 2004, DESC represents the net expense or over recovery associated with New Jersey NUGs, MTC and other restructuring items. A key driver of the $43.3 million change was $27.5 million for the New Jersey deferral disallowance from 2003. ACEs rates for the recovery of these costs are reset annually and the rates will vary from year to year. On ACEs balance sheet, regulatory assets include an under recovery of $97.4 million as of December 31, 2004. This amount is net of a $46.1 million write off on previously disallowed items under appeal. Impairment Losses The impairment losses recorded by PHI in 2003 consist of an impairment charge of $53.3 million from the cancellation of a CT contract and an $11.0 million aircraft investments impairment. Gain on Sales of Assets During 2004, PHI recorded $30.0 million in pre tax gains on the sale of assets compared to a $68.8 million pre tax gain in 2003. The 2004 pre tax gains primarily consist of (i) a $14.7 million pre tax gain from the condemnation settlement with the City of Vineland relating to the ACE transfer of distribution assets and customer accounts, (ii) an $8.3 million pre tax gain on the sale of aircraft investments by PCI, and (iii) a $6.6 million pre tax gain on the sale of land. The $68.8 million pre tax gain in 2003 represents the gain on the sale of PHIs office building which was owned by PCI. Other Income (Expenses) Other expenses (which are net of other income) decreased $91.9 million to $341.4 million in 2004 from $433.3 million in 2003. The decrease was primarily due to a pre tax impairment charge of $102.6 million related to PHIs investment in Starpower in 2003, compared to a pre tax impairment charge of $11.2 million related to Starpower that was recorded in 2004. Preferred Stock Dividend Requirements of Subsidiaries Preferred Stock Dividend Requirements decreased by $11.1 million to $2.8 million in 2004 from $13.9 million in 2003. Of this decrease, $6.9 million was attributable to SFAS No. 150, which requires that dividends on Mandatorily Redeemable Serial Preferred Stock declared subsequent to July 1, 2003 be recorded as interest expense. An additional $4.6 million of the decrease resulted from lower dividends in 2004 due to the redemption of the Trust Originated Preferred Securities in 2003. Income Tax Expense Pepco Holdings effective tax rate for 2004 was 39% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference were state income taxes (net of federal benefit), the flow through of certain book/tax depreciation differences, and the settlement with the IRS on certain non lease financial assets (which is the primary reason for the higher effective tax rate as compared to 2003), partially offset by the flow through of Deferred Investment Tax Credits and tax benefits related to certain leveraged leases, and the benefit associated with the retroactive 56 adjustment for the issuance of final consolidated tax return regulations by a taxing authority. Pepco Holdings effective tax rate for 2003 was 37% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference were state income taxes (net of federal benefit) and the flow through of certain book/tax depreciation differences, partially offset by the flow through of Deferred Investment Tax Credits and tax benefits related to certain leveraged leases. Extraordinary Item In July 2003, the NJBPU approved the recovery of $149.5 million of stranded costs related to ACEs B.L. England generating facility. As a result of the order, ACE reversed $10.0 million of accruals for the possible disallowances related to these stranded costs. The credit to income of $5.9 million is classified as an extraordinary gain in the financial statements, since the original accrual was part of an extraordinary charge in conjunction with the accounting for competitive restructuring in 1999. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY This section discusses Pepco Holdings capital structure, cash flow activity, capital spending plans and other uses and sources of capital for 2005 and 2004. Capital Structure The components of Pepco Holdings capital structure are shown below as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 in accordance with GAAP. The table also shows the following adjustments to components of the capital structure made for the reasons discussed in the footnotes to the table: (i) the exclusion from debt of the Transition Bonds issued by ACE Funding, and (ii) the treatment of the Variable Rate Demand Bonds (VRDBs) issued by certain of PHIs subsidiaries as long term, rather than short term, debt obligations (Millions of dollars): 2005 Per Balance Sheet Adjustments As Adjusted As Adjusted % Common Shareholders Equity $ 3,584.1 $ $3,584.1 41.8% Preferred Stock of Subsidiaries (a) 45.9 45.9 .5% Long Term Debt 4,202.9 156.4 (b) 4,359.3 50.8% Transition Bonds issued by ACE Funding 494.3 (494.3) (c) Long Term Project Funding 25.5 25.5 .3% Capital Lease Obligations 116.6 116.6 1.4% Capital Lease Obligations due within one year 5.3 5.3 .1% Short Term Debt 156.4 (156.4) (b) Current Maturities of Long Term Debt 469.5 (29.0) (d) 440.5 5.1% Total $ 9,100.5 $(523.3) $8,577.2 100.0% 57 2004 Per Balance Sheet Adjustments As Adjusted As Adjusted % Common Shareholders Equity $3,339.0 $ $3,339.0 38.1% Preferred Stock of Subsidiaries (a) 54.9 54.9 .6% Long Term Debt 4,362.1 158.4 (b) 4,520.5 51.7% Transition Bonds issued by ACE Funding 523.3 (523.3) (c) Long Term Project Funding 65.3 65.3 .7% Capital Lease Obligations 122.1 122.1 1.4% Capital Lease Obligations due within one year 4.9 4.9 .1% Short Term Debt 319.7 (158.4) (b) 161.3 1.8% Current Maturities of Long Term Debt 516.3 (28.1) (d) 488.2 5.6% Total $9,307.6 $(551.4) $8,756.2 100.0% (a) Consists of Serial Preferred Stock and Redeemable Serial Preferred Stock issued by subsidiaries of PHI. (b) In accordance with GAAP, the VRDBs are included in short term debt on the Balance Sheet of PHI because they are payable on demand by the holder. However, under the terms of the VRDBs, when demand is made for payment by the holder (specifically, when the VRDBs are submitted for purchase by the holder), the VRDBs are remarketed by a remarketing agent on a best efforts basis and the remarketing resets the interest rate at market rates. Due to the creditworthiness of the issuers, PHI expects that any VRDBs submitted for purchase will be successfully remarketed. Because of these characteristics of the VRDBs, PHI, from a debt management standpoint, views the VRDBs (which have nominal maturity dates ranging from 2009 to 2031) as Long Term Debt and, accordingly, the adjustment reduces Short Term Debt and inc reases Long Term Debt by an amount equal to the principal amount of the VRDBs. (c) Adjusted to exclude Transition Bonds issued by ACE Funding. Because repayment of the Transition Bonds is funded solely by charges collected from ACEs customers and is not a general obligation of ACE or PHI, PHI excludes the Transition Bonds from capitalization from a debt management standpoint. (d) Adjusted to exclude the current maturities of Transition Bonds issued by ACE Funding. In 2003, PHI established a goal of reducing its total debt and preferred stock outstanding by $1 billion by the end of 2007 to improve PHIs interest coverage ratios and to achieve a ratio of consolidated equity to total capitalization (excluding Transition Bonds issued by ACE Funding) in the mid 40% range. Because the net proceeds of $278 million from a public offering of PHI common stock in 2004 was not contemplated in the original $1 billion debt reduction plan, PHI raised its debt reduction goal to $1.3 billion by 2007. PHI expects to meet its debt reduction goal through a combination of internally generated cash, equity issuances through the Shareholder Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP), and asset dispositions. (See "Risk Factors" for a description of factors that could cause PHI to not meet this goal.) The total debt and preferred stock reduction achieved through year end 2005 is $1.14 billion. Set forth below is a summary of the equity and long term debt financing activity during 2005 for Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries. Pepco Holdings issued 1,228,505 shares of common stock under the DRP and various benefit plans. The proceeds from the issuances were added to PHIs general funds. Pepco Holdings issued $250 million of floating rate unsecured notes due 2010. The net proceeds of $248.5 million were used to repay commercial paper issued to fund the redemptions of Conectiv debt. 58 Pepco issued $175 million of 5.40% senior secured notes due 2035. The net proceeds of $172.8 million, plus additional funds, were used to pay at maturity and redeem higher interest rate securities of $175 million. DPL issued $100 million of unsecured notes due in 2015. The net proceeds of $98.9 million, plus additional funds, were used to redeem higher interest rate securities of $100 million. Proceeds from Sale of Claims with Mirant In December 2005, Pepco received proceeds of $112.9 million for the sale of the Pepco TPA Claim and the Pepco asbestos claim against the Mirant bankruptcy estate. After customer sharing, Pepco recorded a pre tax gain of $70.5 million related to the settlement of these claims. Sale of Buzzard Point Property In August 2005, Pepco sold for $75 million in cash 384,051 square feet of excess non utility land owned by Pepco located at Buzzard Point in the District of Columbia. The sale resulted in a pre tax gain of $68.1 million which was recorded as a reduction of Operating Expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Financial Investment Liquidation In October 2005, PCI received $13.3 million in cash and recorded an after tax gain of $8.9 million related to the liquidation of a financial investment that was written off in 2001. Working Capital At December 31, 2005, Pepco Holdings current assets on a consolidated basis totaled $2.2 billion and its current liabilities totaled $2.4 billion. At December 31, 2004, Pepco Holdings current assets totaled $1.7 billion and its current liabilities totaled $1.9 billion. PHIs working capital deficit results in large part from the fact that, in the normal course of business, PHIs utility subsidiaries acquire energy supplies for their customers before the supplies are delivered to, metered and billed to customers. Short term financing is used to meet liquidity needs. Short term financing is also used, at times, to fund temporary redemptions of long term debt, until long term replacement financings are completed. At December 31, 2005, Pepco Holdings cash and cash equivalents and its restricted cash, totaled $144.5 million, of which $112.8 million was net cash collateral held by subsidiaries of PHI engaged in Competitive Energy and Default Electricity Supply activities (none of which was held as restricted cash). At December 31, 2004, Pepco Holdings cash and cash equivalents and its restricted cash totaled $71.5 million, of which $21 million was net cash collateral held by subsidiaries of PHI engaged in Competitive Energy and Default Electricity Supply activities (of which $7.6 million was held as restricted cash). See "Capital Requirements Contractual Arrangements with Credit Rating Triggers or Margining Rights" for additional information. 59 A detail of PHIs short term debt balance and its current maturities of long term debt and project funding balance follows: As of December 31, 2005 (Millions of dollars) Type PHI Parent Pepco DPL ACE ACE Funding Conectiv Energy PES PCI Conectiv PHI Consolidated Variable Rate Demand Bonds $ $ $104.8 $22.6 $ $ $29.0 $ $ $156.4 Floating Rate Note Commercial Paper Total Short Term Debt $ $ $104.8 $22.6 $ $ $29.0 $ $ $156.4 Current Maturities of Long Term Debt and Project Funding $300.0 $50.0 $ 22.9 $65.0 $29.0 $ $ 2.6 $ $ $469.5 As of December 31, 2004 (Millions of dollars) Type PHI Parent Pepco DPL ACE ACE Funding Conectiv Energy PES PCI Conectiv PHI Consolidated Variable Rate Demand Bonds $ $ $104.8 $22.6 $ $ $31.0 $ $ $158.4 Floating Rate Note 50.0 50.0 Commercial Paper 78.6 32.7 111.3 Total Short Term Debt $128.6 $ $104.8 $55.3 $ $ $31.0 $ $ $319.7 Current Maturities of Long Term Debt and Project Funding $ $100.0 $ 2.7 $40.0 $28.1 $ $ 5.5 $60.0 $280.0 $516.3 Cash Flow Activity PHIs cash flows for 2005, 2004, and 2003 are summarized below. Cash Source (Use) 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of dollars) Operating Activities $986.9 $715.7 $662.4 Investing Activities (333.9) (417.3) (252.7) Financing Activities (561.0) (359.1) (370.7) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 92.0 $(60.7) $ 39.0 60 Operating Activities Cash flows from operating activities are summarized below for 2005, 2004, and 2003. Cash Source (Use) 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of dollars) Net Income $371.2 $260.6 $107.3 Non cash adjustments to net income 156.5 521.9 643.8 Changes in working capital 459.2 (66.8) (88.7) Net cash provided by operating activities $986.9 $715.7 $662.4 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $271.2 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. A $110.6 million increase in net income in 2005 as compared to 2004 is a result of improved operating results at PHIs regulated utilities. Other increases in operating activities include the following: (i) Pepcos receipt of $112.9 million in proceeds in December 2005 for the sale of the Pepco TPA Claim and the Pepco asbestos claim against the Mirant bankruptcy estate, (ii) a decrease of approximately $29 million in interest paid on debt obligations in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to a decrease in outstanding debt, (iii) an increase in power broker payables in 2005 as a result of higher electricity prices, and (iv) an increase from $21 million to $112.8 million in the cash collateral held in connection with Competitive Energy activities. Cash flows from operating activities increased by $53.3 million to $715.7 million in 2004 from $662.4 million in 2003. The $53.3 million increase was largely the result of improved operating results at PHIs Regulated utilities. Regulated T&D Electric experienced 2% growth in Gwh sales in 2004, and Regulated T&D Revenue increased by $45.6 million primarily due to customer growth and increased average usage, higher average effective rates, and favorable warmer weather. The Power Delivery business produced over 80% of consolidated cash from operations in 2005, 2004 and 2003. Investing Activities The most significant items included in cash flows related to investing activities during 2005, 2004, and 2003 are summarized below. Cash Source (Use) 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of dollars) Capital expenditures $(467.1) $(517.4) $(598.2) Cash proceeds from sale of: Starpower investment 29.0 Marketable securities, net 19.4 156.6 Office building and other properties 84.1 46.4 147.7 All other investing cash flows, net 49.1 5.3 41.2 Net cash used by investing activities $(333.9) $(417.3) $(252.7) 61 Net cash used by investing activities decreased by $83.4 million in 2005 compared to 2004. The decrease is primarily due to a $50.3 million decrease in capital expenditures, net proceeds of $73.7 million received from the sale of non utility land in 2005, and proceeds of $33.8 million received by PCI from the sale of an energy investment and from the final liquidation of a financial investment that was written off in 2001. In 2004, capital expenditures decreased $80.8 million to $517.4 million from $598.2 million in 2003. The decrease was primarily due to lower construction expenditures for Conectiv Energy, offset by an increase in Power Delivery capital requirements to upgrade electric transmission and distribution systems. In 2004, PHI sold its 50% interest in Starpower for $29 million in cash. Additionally in 2004, PCI continued to liquefy its marketable securities portfolio and PHI received proceeds from the sale of aircraft and land. In 2003, PCI liquidated its marketable securities portfolio. Additionally, in 2003, PHI received cash proceeds of $147.7 million from the sale by PCI of an office building known as Edison Place (which serves as headquarters for PHI and Pepco). Financing Activities Cash Source (Use) 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of dollars) Common stock dividends $ (188.9) $ (176.0) $(170.7) Common stock issuances 33.2 318.0 32.8 Preferred stock redemptions (9.0) (53.3) (197.5) Long term debt issuances 532.0 650.4 1,136.9 Long term debt redemptions (755.8) (1,214.7) (692.2) Short term debt, net (161.3) 136.3 (452.7) Other (11.2) (19.8) (27.3) Net cash used in financing activities $ (561.0) $ (359.1) $(370.7) Net cash used by financing activities increased by $201.9 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. Common stock dividend payments were $188.9 million in 2005, $176.0 million in 2004 and $170.7 million in 2003. The increase in common dividends paid in 2005 and 2004 was due to the issuance of 14,950,000 shares of common stock in September 2004 and issuances of 1,228,505 and 1,471,936 shares in 2005 and 2004, respectively, of common stock under the DRP. 62 Preferred stock redemptions in 2005 totaled $9.0 million and included the following: (i) in October 2005, Pepco redeemed 22,795 shares of its $2.44 Series 1957 Serial Preferred Stock at $1.1 million, 74,103 shares of its $2.46 Series 1958 Serial Preferred Stock at $3.7 million, and 13,148 shares of its $2.28 Series 1965 Serial Preferred Stock at $.7 million, (ii) in August 2005, ACE redeemed 160 shares of its 4.35% Serial Preferred Stock at $.02 million, and (iii) in December 2005, DPL redeemed all of the 35,000 shares of its 6.75% Serial Preferred Stock outstanding at $3.5 million. In 2005, Pepco Holdings issued $250 million of floating rate unsecured notes due 2010. The net proceeds, plus additional funds, were used to repay commercial paper issued to fund the redemption of $300 million of Conectiv debt. In September 2005, Pepco used the proceeds from the June 2005 issuance of $175 million in senior secured notes to fund the retirement of $100 million in first mortgage bonds at maturity as well as the redemption of $75 million in first mortgage bonds prior to maturity. In 2005, DPL issued $100 million of unsecured notes due 2015 to redeem $100 million of higher rate securities. In December 2005, Pepco paid down $50 million of its $100 million bank loan due December 2006. In 2005, ACE retired at maturity $40 million of medium term notes. In 2005, PCI redeemed $60 million of Medium Term Notes. Described above are $525 million of the $532 million total 2005 long term debt issuances and $725 million of the $755.8 million total 2005 long term debt redemptions. As a result of the 2004 common stock issuance, Pepco Holdings received $278.5 million of proceeds, net of issuance costs of $10.3 million. The proceeds in combination with short term debt were used to prepay in its entirety the $335 million Conectiv Bethlehem term loan. In 2004, Pepco redeemed all of the 900,000 shares of $3.40 series mandatorily redeemable preferred stock then outstanding for $45 million, and 165,902 shares of $2.28 series preferred stock for $8.3 million. In 2004, Pepco Holdings redeemed $200 million of variable rate notes at maturity. 63 In 2004, Pepco issued $275 million of secured senior notes with maturities of 10 and 30 years, the net proceeds of which were used to redeem higher interest rate securities of $210 million and to repay short term debt. Pepco borrowed $100 million under a bank loan due in 2006, and proceeds were used to redeem mandatorily redeemable preferred stock and repay short term debt. DPL issued $100 million of unsecured notes that mature in 2014, the net proceeds of which were used to redeem trust preferred securities and repay short term debt. ACE issued $54.7 million of insured auction rate tax exempt securities and $120 million of secured senior notes which mature in 2029 and 2034, respectively; the net proceeds of $173.2 million were used to redeem higher interest rate securities. Conectiv redeemed $50 million of Medium Term Notes, and PCI redeemed $86 million of Medium Term Notes in 2004. In 2004, redemptions of mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities included $70 m illion for DPL and $25 million for ACE. Described above are $649.7 million of the $650.4 million total 2004 long term debt issuances and $1,149.2 million of the $1,214.7 million total 2004 long term debt redemptions. In 2003, Pepco Holdings issued $700 million of unsecured long term debt with maturities ranging from 1 year to 7 years, the net proceeds of which were used to repay short term debt. Pepco issued $200 million of secured senior notes, and proceeds were used to refinance $125 million trust preferred securities and repay short term debt. Pepco redeemed $50 million of First Mortgage Bonds at maturity, $140 million of First Mortgage Bonds, and $15 million of Medium Term Notes during 2003. DPL issued $33.2 million of tax exempt bonds having maturities ranging from 5 to 35 years, the net proceeds of which were used to refinance higher interest debt of $33 million. DPL also redeemed $85 million of First Mortgage Bonds at maturity and $32 million of higher interest rate securities. ACE redeemed $40 million of First Mortgage Bonds and $30 million Medium Term Notes at maturity, and redeemed $58 million of higher interest rate securities. ACE Funding issued $152 million of Transitio n Bonds with maturities ranging from 8 to 17 years, the net proceeds of which were used to recover the stranded costs associated with an ACE generation asset and transaction costs. PCI redeemed $141 million of Medium Term Notes in 2003. Conectiv redeemed $50 million of Medium Term Notes. Also, in 2003, redemptions of mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities included $125 million for Pepco, and $70 million for ACE. Described above are $1,085.2 million of the $1,136.9 million total 2003 long term debt issuances and $647 million of the $692.2 million total 2003 long term debt redemptions. Subsequent Financing On February 9, 2006, certain institutional buyers tentatively agreed to purchase in a private placement $105 million of ACEs senior notes having an interest rate of 5.80% and a term of 30 years. The execution of a definitive purchase agreement and closing is expected on or about March 15, 2006. The proceeds from the notes would be used to repay outstanding commercial paper issued by ACE to fund the payment at maturity of $105 million in principal amount of various issues of medium term notes. On March 1, 2006, Pepco redeemed all outstanding shares of its Serial Preferred Stock of each series, at 102% of par, for an aggregate redemption amount of $21.9 million. 64 Capital Requirements Construction Expenditures Pepco Holdings construction expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $467.1 million of which $432.1 million was related to the Power Delivery businesses and the remainder related to Conectiv Energy and Pepco Energy Services. For the five year period 2006 through 2010, approximate construction expenditures are projected as follows: For the Year 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Total Total $571 $505 $500 $480 $492 $2,548 Power Delivery related $535 $477 $470 $454 $469 $2,405 These amounts include estimated costs for environmental compliance by PHIs subsidiaries. See Item 1 "Business Environmental Matters." Pepco Holdings expects to fund these expenditures through internally generated cash from the Power Delivery businesses. Dividends Pepco Holdings annual dividend rate on its common stock is determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration, among other factors, current and possible future developments that may affect PHIs income and cash flows. PHIs Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of 25 cents per share of common stock payable on March 31, 2005, June 30, 2005, September 30, 2005 and December 31, 2005. On January 26, 2006, Pepco Holdings declared a dividend on common stock of 26 cents per share payable March 31, 2006, to shareholders of record March 10, 2006. PHI generates no operating income of its own. Accordingly, its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders depends on dividends received from its subsidiaries. In addition to their future financial performance, the ability of PHIs direct and indirect subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to limits imposed by: (i) state corporate and regulatory laws, which impose limitations on the funds that can be used to pay dividends and, in the case of regulatory laws, as applicable, may require the prior approval of the relevant utility regulatory commissions before dividends can be paid, (ii) the prior rights of holders of existing and future preferred stock, mortgage bonds and other long term debt issued by the subsidiaries, and any other restrictions imposed in connection with the incurrence of liabilities, and (iii) certain provisions of the charters of Pepco, DPL and ACE, which impose restrictions on the payment of common stock dividends for the benefit of preferred stockhold ers. Pepcos articles of incorporation and DPLs certificate and articles of incorporation each contain provisions restricting the amount of dividends that can be paid on common stock when preferred stock is outstanding if the applicable companys capitalization ratio is less than 25%. For this purpose, the capitalization ratio is equal to (i) common stock capital plus surplus, divided by (ii) total capital (including long term debt) plus surplus. In addition, DPLs certificate 65 and articles of incorporation and ACEs certificate of incorporation each provide that, if preferred stock is outstanding, no dividends may be paid on common stock if, after payment, the applicable companys common stock capital plus surplus would be less than the involuntary liquidation value of the outstanding preferred stock. Pepco has no shares of preferred stock outstanding. Currently, the restriction in the ACE charter does not limit its ability to pay dividends. Pension Funding Pepco Holdings has a noncontributory retirement plan (the Retirement Plan) that covers substantially all employees of Pepco, DPL and ACE and certain employees of other Pepco Holdings subsidiaries. As of the 2005 valuation, the Retirement Plan satisfied the minimum funding requirements of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) without requiring any additional funding. However, PHIs funding policy with regard to the Retirement Plan is to maintain a funding level in excess of 100% of its accumulated benefit obligation (ABO). In 2005 and 2004, PHI made discretionary tax deductible cash contributions to the Retirement Plan in accordance with its funding policy as described below. In 2005, the ABO for the Retirement Plan increased over 2004, due to the accrual of an additional year of service for participants and a decrease in the discount rate used to value the ABO obligation. The change in the discount rate reflected the continued decline in long term interest rates in 2005. The Retirement Plan assets achieved returns in 2005 below the 8.50% level assumed in the valuation. As a result of the combination of these factors, in December 2005 PHI contributed $60 million (all of which was funded by ACE) to the Retirement Plan. The contribution was made to ensure that under reasonable assumptions, the funding level at year end would be in excess of 100% of the ABO. In 2004, PHI contributed a total of $10 million (all of which was funded by Pepco) to the Retirement Plan. Assuming no changes to the current pension plan assumptions, PHI projects no funding will be required under ERISA in 2006; however, PHI may elect to make a discretionary tax deductible contribution, if required to maintain its assets in excess of ABO for the Retirement Plan. 66 Contractual Obligations And Commercial Commitments Summary information about Pepco Holdings consolidated contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2005, is as follows: Contractual Maturity Obligation Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years (Millions of dollars) Variable rate demand bonds $ 156.4 $ 156.4 $ $ $ Long term debt 5,170.3 467.1 1,178.4 614.1 2,910.7 Interest payments on debt 2,787.9 280.1 468.6 384.7 1,654.5 Capital leases 213.9 15.8 30.9 30.4 136.8 Operating leases 561.0 38.3 77.2 78.0 367.5 Non derivative fuel and purchase power contracts (a) 7,406.8 1,823.7 1,705.0 754.3 3,123.8 Total $16,296.3 $2,781.4 $3,460.1 $1,861.5 $8,193.3 (a) Excludes the PPA Related Obligations that are part of the back to back agreement that was entered into with Mirant (See "Relationship with Mirant Corporation" for additional information) and excludes ACEs BGS load supply. Third Party Guarantees, Indemnifications and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Pepco Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries have various financial and performance guarantees and indemnification obligations which are entered into in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties as discussed below. As of December 31, 2005, Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries were parties to a variety of agreements pursuant to which they were guarantors for standby letters of credit, performance residual value, and other commitments and obligations. The fair value of these commitments and obligations was not required to be recorded in Pepco Holdings Consolidated Balance Sheets; however, certain energy marketing obligations of Conectiv Energy were recorded. The commitments and obligations, in millions of dollars, were as follows: Guarantor PHI DPL ACE Other Total Energy marketing obligations of Conectiv Energy (1) $ 167.5 $ $ $ $ 167.5 Energy procurement obligations of Pepco Energy Services (1) 13.4 13.4 Guaranteed lease residual values (2) .6 3.3 3.2 7.1 Other (3) 18.3 2.4 20.7 Total $ 199.8 $ 3.3 $ 3.2 $ 2.4 $ 208.7 1. Pepco Holdings has contractual commitments for performance and related payments of Conectiv Energy and Pepco Energy Services to counterparties related to routine energy sales and procurement obligations, including requirements under BGS contracts entered into with ACE. 2. Subsidiaries of Pepco Holdings have guaranteed residual values in excess of fair value related to certain equipment and fleet vehicles held through lease agreements. As of December 31, 2005, obligations under the guarantees were approximately $7.1 million. Assets leased under agreements subject to 67 residual value guarantees are typically for periods ranging from 2 years to 10 years. Historically, payments under the guarantees have not been made by the guarantor as, under normal conditions, the contract runs to full term at which time the residual value is minimal. As such, Pepco Holdings believes the likelihood of payment being required under the guarantee is remote. 3. Other guarantees consist of: Pepco Holdings has guaranteed payment of a bond issued by a subsidiary of $14.9 million. Pepco Holdings does not expect to fund the full amount of the exposure under the guarantee. Pepco Holdings has guaranteed a subsidiary building lease of $3.4 million. Pepco Holdings does not expect to fund the full amount of the exposure under the guarantee. PCI has guaranteed facility rental obligations related to contracts entered into by Starpower. As of December 31, 2005, the guarantees cover the remaining $2.4 million in rental obligations. Pepco Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries have entered into various indemnification agreements related to purchase and sale agreements and other types of contractual agreements with vendors and other third parties. These indemnification agreements typically cover environmental, tax, litigation and other matters, as well as breaches of representations, warranties and covenants set forth in these agreements. Typically, claims may be made by third parties under these indemnification agreements over various periods of time depending on the nature of the claim. The maximum potential exposure under these indemnification agreements can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount depending on the nature of the claim and the particular transaction. The total maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements is not estimable due to several factors, including uncertainty as to whether or when claims may be made under these indemnities. 68 Energy Contract Net Asset Activity The following table provides detail on changes in net asset or liability position of the Competitive Energy business with respect to energy commodity contracts from one period to the next: Roll forward of Mark to Market Energy Contract Net Assets For the Year Ended December 31, 2005 (Dollars are pre tax and in millions) Proprietary Trading (1) Other Energy Commodity (2) Total Total Marked to Market (MTM) Energy Contract Net Assets at December 31, 2004 $ .9 $ 25.7 $ 26.6 Total change in unrealized fair value excluding reclassification to realized at settlement of contracts .1 36.2 36.3 Reclassification to realized at settlement of contracts (1.0) (124.6) (125.6) Effective portion of changes in fair value recorded in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) 121.9 121.9 Ineffective portion of changes in fair value recorded in earnings .3 .3 Changes in valuation techniques and assumptions Purchase/sale of existing contracts or portfolios subject to MTM .4 .4 Total MTM Energy Contract Net Assets at December 31, 2005 $ $ 59.9 $ 59.9 Detail of MTM Energy Contract Net Assets at December 31, 2005 (see above) Total Current Assets (other current assets) $173.3 Noncurrent Assets (other assets) 65.1 Total MTM Energy Assets 238.4 Current Liabilities (other current liabilities) (114.2) Noncurrent Liabilities (other liabilities) (64.3) Total MTM Energy Contract Liabilities (178.5) Total MTM Energy Contract Net Assets $ 59.9 Notes: (1) Includes all contracts held for proprietary trading since the discontinuation of that activity in 2003.

In the event of a downgrade, the amount required to be posted would depend on the amount of the underlying contractual obligation existing at the time of the downgrade. As of December 31, 2005, a one level downgrade in the credit rating of PHI and all of its affected subsidiaries would have required PHI and such subsidiaries to provide aggregate cash collateral or letters of credit of up to approximately $181 million. An additional approximately $328 million of aggregate cash collateral or letters of credit would have been required in the event of subsequent downgrades to below investment grade. PHI believes that it and its utility subsidiaries maintain adequate short term funding sources in the event the additional collateral or letters of credit are required. See "Sources of Capital Short Term Funding Sources." Many of the contractual arrangements entered into by PHIs subsidiaries in connection with competitive energy activities include margining rights pursuant to which the PHI subsidiary or a counterparty may request collateral if the market value of the contractual obligations reaches levels in excess of the credit thresholds established in the applicable arrangements. Pursuant to these margining rights, the affected PHI subsidiary may receive, or be required to post, collateral due to energy price movements. As of December 31, 2005, Pepco Holdings subsidiaries engaged in competitive energy activities and default supply activities were in receipt of (a net holder of) cash collateral in the amount of $112.8 million in connection with their competitive energy activities. Environmental Remediation Obligations PHIs accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2005 include approximately $22.3 million, of which $5.6 million is expected to be incurred in 2006, for potential cleanup and other costs related to sites at which an operating subsidiary is a PRP, is alleged to be a third party contributor, or has made a decision to clean up contamination on its own property. For information regarding projected expenditures for environmental control facilities, see Item 1 "Business Environmental Matters." The principal environmental remediation obligations as of December 31, 2005, were: $6.8 million, of which $1.0 million is expected to be incurred in 2006, payable by DPL in accordance with a consent agreement reached with DNREC during 2001, for remediation, site restoration, natural resource damage compensatory projects and other costs associated with environmental contamination that resulted from an oil release at the Indian River power plant. That plant was sold on June 22, 2001. ACEs entry into a sale agreement in 2000 (which was subsequently terminated) for the B.L. England and Deepwater generating facilities (ACE transferred the Deepwater generating facility to Conectiv Energy on February 29, 2004) triggered the applicability of the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act requiring remediation at these facilities. When the prospective purchaser of these generating facilities terminated the agreement of sale in accordance with the agreements termination provisions, ACE decided to continue the environmental investigation process at these facilities. ACE and Conectiv Energy are continuing the investigation with oversight from NJDEP. ACE anticipates 71 that it will incur approximately $2.2 million in environmental remediation costs, of which $860,000 is expected to be incurred in 2006, associated with the B.L. England generating facility. Conectiv Energy anticipates that it will incur approximately $6.0 million in environmental remediation costs, of which $690,000 is expected to be incurred in 2006, associated with the Deepwater generating facility. As a result of a December 7, 2003 oil spill at the B.L. England generating facility, $811,000 was accrued in December 2003 for estimated clean up, remediation, restoration, and potential NJDEP natural resources damage assessments. As of December 31, 2005, ACE has spent $611,000 for clean up, remediation, and restoration. The remaining liability of $200,000 is anticipated to cover future restoration efforts to be monitored for three years ending in May 2007. The NJDEP natural resource damage assessments, if any, have not been determined at this time. DPL expects to incur costs of approximately $2.6 million in connection with a site located in Wilmington, Delaware, to remediate residual material from the historical operation of a manufactured gas plant. Approximately $2.0 million is expected to be incurred in 2006. Pepco expects to incur approximately $1.3 million for long term monitoring in connection with a pipeline oil release, of which $140,000 is expected to be incurred in 2006. Sources Of Capital Pepco Holdings sources to meet its long term funding needs, such as capital expenditures, dividends, and new investments, and its short term funding needs, such as working capital and the temporary funding of long term funding needs, include internally generated funds, securities issuances and bank financing under new or existing facilities. PHIs ability to generate funds from its operations and to access capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties. See "Risk Factors" for a discussion of important factors that may impact these sources of capital. Internally Generated Cash The primary source of Pepco Holdings internally generated funds is the cash flow generated by its regulated utility subsidiaries in the Power Delivery business. Additional sources of funds include cash flow generated from its non regulated subsidiaries and the sale of non core assets. Short Term Funding Sources Pepco Holdings and its regulated utility subsidiaries have traditionally used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs, such as commercial paper, short term notes and bank lines of credit. Proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs but may also be used to fund temporarily long term capital requirements. Pepco Holdings maintains an ongoing commercial paper program of up to $700 million. Pepco, DPL, and ACE have ongoing commercial paper programs of up to $300 million, up to $275 million, and up to $250 million, respectively. The commercial paper can be issued with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper programs of PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE are backed by a $1.2 billion credit facility. 72 Long Term Funding Sources The sources of long term funding for PHI and its subsidiaries are the issuance of debt and equity securities and borrowing under long term credit agreements. Proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements, such as capital expenditures and new investments, and to repay or refinance existing indebtedness. PUHCA Restrictions Because Pepco Holdings is a public utility holding company that was registered under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA 1935), it was required to obtain Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval to issue securities. PUHCA 1935 also prohibited Pepco Holdings from borrowing from its subsidiaries. Under an SEC Financing Order dated June 30, 2005 (the Financing Order), Pepco Holdings is authorized to issue equity, preferred securities and debt securities in an aggregate amount not to exceed $6 billion through an authorization period ending June 30, 2008, subject to a ceiling on the effective cost of these funds. Pepco Holdings is also authorized to enter into guarantees to third parties or otherwise provide credit support with respect to obligations of its subsidiaries of up to $3.5 billion. Of this amount, only $1.75 billion may be on behalf of subsidiaries engaged in energy marketing activities. As permitted under FERC regulations promulgated und er the newly effective Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005), Pepco Holdings will give notice to FERC that it will continue to operate pursuant to the authority granted in the Financing Order until further notice. Under the Financing Order, Pepco Holdings is limited to issuing no more than an aggregate of 20 million shares of common stock under the DRP and employee benefit plans during the period ending June 30, 2008. The Financing Order requires that, in order to issue debt or equity securities, including commercial paper, Pepco Holdings must maintain a ratio of common stock equity to total capitalization (consisting of common stock, preferred stock, if any, long term debt and short term debt for this purpose) of at least 30 percent. At December 31, 2005, Pepco Holdings common equity ratio for purposes of the Financing Order was 40.1 percent. The Financing Order also requires that all rated securities issued by Pepco Holdings be rated "investment grade" by at least one nationally recognized rating agency. Accordingly, if Pepco Holdings common equity ratio were less than 30 percent or if no nationally recognized rating agency rated a security investment grade, Pepco Holdings could not issue the security without first obtaining an amendment to the Financing Order from FERC. If an amendment to the Financing Order or other FERC authority pursuant to the Federal Power Act or FERC regulations is required to enable Pepco Holdings or any of its subsidiaries to effect a financing, there is no certainty that such an amendment or authority could be obtained nor certainty as to the timing of FERC action. The foregoing financing limitations also generally apply to Pepco, DPL, ACE and certain other Pepco Holdings subsidiaries. 73 Money Pool Under the Financing Order, Pepco Holdings has received SEC authorization under PUHCA 1935, which will continue until June 30, 2008 under PUHCA 2005, to establish the Pepco Holdings system money pool. The money pool is a cash management mechanism used by Pepco Holdings to manage the short term investment and borrowing requirements of the PHI subsidiaries that participate in the money pool. Pepco Holdings may invest in but not borrow from the money pool. Eligible subsidiaries with surplus cash may deposit those funds in the money pool. Deposits in the money pool are guaranteed by Pepco Holdings. Eligible subsidiaries with cash requirements may borrow from the money pool. Borrowings from the money pool are unsecured. Depositors in the money pool receive, and borrowers from the money pool pay, an interest rate based primarily on Pepco Holdings short term borrowing rate. Pepco Holdings deposits funds in the money pool to the extent that the pool has insufficient fund s to meet the borrowing needs of its participants, which may require Pepco Holdings to borrow funds for deposit from external sources. Consequently, Pepco Holdings external borrowing requirements fluctuate based on the amount of funds required to be deposited in the money pool. REGULATORY AND OTHER MATTERS Relationship with Mirant Corporation In 2000, Pepco sold substantially all of its electricity generation assets to Mirant Corporation, formerly Southern Energy, Inc. As part of the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, Pepco entered into several ongoing contractual arrangements with Mirant Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries. In July 2003, Mirant Corporation and most of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas (the Bankruptcy Court). On December 9, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court approved Mirants Plan of Reorganization (the Reorganization Plan) and the Mirant business emerged from bankruptcy on January 3, 2006 (the Bankruptcy Emergence Date), in the form of a new corporation of the same name (together with its predecessors, Mirant). However, as discussed below, the Reorganization Plan did not resolve all of the outstanding matters between Pepco and Mirant relating to the Mirant bankruptcy and the litigation between Pepco and Mirant over these matters is ongoing. Depending on the outcome of ongoing litigation, the Mirant bankruptcy could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and cash flows of Pepco Holdings and Pepco. However, management believes that Pepco Holdings and Pepco currently have sufficient cash, cash flow and borrowing capacity under their credit facilities and in the capital markets to be able to satisfy any additional cash requirements that may arise due to the Mirant bankruptcy. Accordingly, management does not anticipate that the Mirant bankruptcy will impair the ability of either Pepco Holdings or Pepco to fulfill its contractual obligations or to fund projected capital expenditures. On this basis, management currently does not believe that the Mirant bankruptcy will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of either company. 74 Transition Power Agreements As part of the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, Pepco and Mirant entered into Transition Power Agreements for Maryland and the District of Columbia, respectively (collectively, the TPAs). Under the TPAs, Mirant was obligated to supply Pepco with all of the capacity and energy needed to fulfill Pepcos SOS obligations during the rate cap periods in each jurisdiction immediately following deregulation, which in Maryland extended through June 2004 and in the District of Columbia extended until January 22, 2005. To avoid the potential rejection of the TPAs by Mirant in the bankruptcy proceeding, Pepco and Mirant in October 2003 entered into an Amended Settlement Agreement and Release (the Settlement Agreement) pursuant to which the terms of the TPAs were modified to increase the purchase price of the capacity and energy supplied by Mirant. In exchange, the Settlement Agreement provided Pepco with an allowed, pre petition general unsecured claim against Mirant Corporation in the amount of $105 million (the Pepco TPA Claim). On December 22, 2005, Pepco completed the sale of the Pepco TPA Claim, plus the right to receive accrued interest thereon, to Deutsche Bank for a cash payment of $112.4 million. Additionally, Pepco received $0.5 million in proceeds from Mirant in settlement of an asbestos claim against the Mirant bankruptcy estate. Pepco Holdings and Pepco recognized a total gain of $70.5 million (pre tax) related to the settlement of these claims. Based on the regulatory settlements entered into in connection with deregulation in Maryland and the District of Columbia, Pepco is obligated to share with its customers the profits it realizes from the provision of SOS during the rate cap periods. The proceeds of the sale of the Pepco TPA Claim will be included in the calculations of the amounts required to be shared with customers in both jurisdictions. Based on the applicable sharing formulas in the respective jurisdictions, Pepco anticipates that customers will receive (through billing cre dits) approximately $42.3 million of the proceeds over a 12 month period beginning in March 2006 (subject to DCPSC and MPSC approvals). Power Purchase Agreements Under agreements with FirstEnergy Corp., formerly Ohio Edison (FirstEnergy), and Allegheny Energy, Inc., both entered into in 1987, Pepco was obligated to purchase 450 megawatts of capacity and energy from FirstEnergy annually through December 2005 (the FirstEnergy PPA). Under the Panda PPA, entered into in 1991, Pepco is obligated to purchase 230 megawatts of capacity and energy from Panda annually through 2021. At the time of the sale of Pepcos generation assets to Mirant, the purchase price of the energy and capacity under the PPAs was, and since that time has continued to be, substantially in excess of the market price. As a part of the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, Pepco entered into a "back to back" arrangement with Mirant. Under this arrangement, Mirant (i) was obligated, through December 2005, to purchase from Pepco the capacity and energy that Pepco was obligated to purchase under the FirstEnergy PPA at a price equal to Pepcos purchase price from Firs tEnergy, and (ii) is obligated through 2021 to purchase from Pepco the capacity and energy that Pepco is obligated to purchase under the Panda PPA at a price equal to Pepcos purchase price from Panda (the PPA Related Obligations). Mirant currently is making these required payments. 75 Pepco Pre Petition Claims At the time the Reorganization Plan was approved by the Bankruptcy Court, Pepco had pending pre petition claims against Mirant totaling approximately $28.5 million (the Pre Petition Claims), consisting of (i) approximately $26 million in payments due to Pepco in respect of the PPA Related Obligations and (ii) approximately $2.5 million that Pepco has paid to Panda in settlement of certain billing disputes under the Panda PPA that related to periods after the sale of Pepcos generation assets to Mirant and prior to Mirants bankruptcy filing, for which Pepco believes Mirant is obligated to reimburse it under the terms of the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement. In the bankruptcy proceeding, Mirant filed an objection to the Pre Petition Claims. The Pre Petition Claims were not resolved in the Reorganization Plan and are the subject of ongoing litigation between Pepco and Mirant. To the extent Pepco is successful in its efforts to recover the Pre Petition Claims, it w ould receive under the terms of the Reorganization Plan a number of shares of common stock of the new corporation created pursuant to the Reorganization Plan (the New Mirant Common Stock) equal to (i) the amount of the allowed claim (ii) divided by the market price of the New Mirant Common Stock on the Bankruptcy Emergence Date. Because the number of shares is based on the market price of the New Mirant Common Stock on the Bankruptcy Emergence Date, Pepco would receive the benefit, and bear the risk, of any change in the market price of the stock between the Bankruptcy Emergence Date and the date the stock is issued to Pepco. As of December 31, 2005, Pepco maintained a receivable in the amount of $28.5 million, representing the Pre Petition Claims, which was offset by a reserve of $14.5 million established by an expense recorded in 2003 to reflect the uncertainty as to whether the entire amount of the Pre Petition Claims is recoverable. As of December 31, 2005, this reserve was reduced to $9.6 million to reflect the fact that there was no longer an objection to $15 million of Pepcos claim. Mirants Efforts to Reject the PPA Related Obligations and Disgorgement Claims In August 2003, Mirant filed with the Bankruptcy Court a motion seeking authorization to reject the PPA Related Obligations (the First Motion to Reject). Upon motions filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas (the District Court) by Pepco and FERC, the District Court in October 2003 withdrew jurisdiction over this matter from the Bankruptcy Court. In December 2003, the District Court denied Mirants motion to reject the PPA Related Obligations on jurisdictional grounds. Mirant appealed the District Courts decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (the Court of Appeals). In August 2004, the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the District Court holding that the District Court had jurisdiction to rule on the merits of Mirants rejection motion, suggesting that in doing so the court apply a "more rigorous standard" than the business judgment rule usually applied by bankruptcy courts in ruling on rejection motions. In December 2004, the District Court issued an order again denying Mirants motion to reject the PPA Related Obligations. The District Court found that the PPA Related Obligations are not severable from the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement and that the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement cannot be rejected in part, as Mirant was seeking to do. Mirant has appealed the District Courts order to the Court of Appeals. 76 In January 2005, Mirant filed in the Bankruptcy Court a motion seeking to reject certain of its ongoing obligations under the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, including the PPA Related Obligations (the Second Motion to Reject). In March 2005, the District Court entered orders granting Pepcos motion to withdraw jurisdiction over these rejection proceedings from the Bankruptcy Court and ordering Mirant to continue to perform the PPA Related Obligations (the March 2005 Orders). Mirant has appealed the March 2005 Orders to the Court of Appeals. In March 2005, Pepco, FERC, the Office of Peoples Counsel of the District of Columbia (the District of Columbia OPC), the MPSC and the Office of Peoples Counsel of Maryland (Maryland OPC) filed in the District Court oppositions to the Second Motion to Reject. In August 2005, the District Court issued an order informally staying this matter, pending a decision by the Court of Appeals on the March 2005 Orders. On February 9, 2006, oral arguments on Mirants appeals of the District Courts order relating to the First Motion to Reject and the March 2005 Orders were held before the Court of Appeals; an opinion has not yet been issued. On December 1, 2005, Mirant filed with the Bankruptcy Court a motion seeking to reject the executory parts of the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement and its obligations under all other related agreements with Pepco, with the exception of Mirants obligations relating to operation of the electric generating stations owned by Pepco Energy Services (the Third Motion to Reject). The Third Motion to Reject also seeks disgorgement of payments made by Mirant to Pepco in respect of the PPA Related Obligations after filing of its bankruptcy petition in July 2003 to the extent the payments exceed the market value of the capacity and energy purchased. On December 21, 2005, Pepco filed an opposition to the Third Motion to Reject in the Bankruptcy Court. On December 1, 2005, Mirant, in an attempt to "recharacterize" the PPA Related Obligations, filed a complaint with the Bankruptcy Court seeking (i) a declaratory judgment that the payments due under the PPA Related Obligations to Pepco are pre petition debt obligations; and (ii) an order entitling Mirant to recover all payments that it made to Pepco on account of these pre petition obligations after the petition date to the extent permitted under bankruptcy law (i.e., disgorgement). On December 15, 2005, Pepco filed a motion with the District Court to withdraw jurisdiction over both of the December 1 filings from the Bankruptcy Court. The motion to withdraw and Mirants underlying complaint have both been stayed pending a decision of the Court of Appeals in the appeals described above. Each of the theories advanced by Mirant to recover funds paid to Pepco relating to the PPA Related Obligations as a practical matter seeks reimbursement for the above market cost of the capacity and energy purchased from Pepco over a period beginning, at the earliest, from the date on which Mirant filed its bankruptcy petition and ending on the date of rejection or the date through which disgorgement is approved. Under these theories, Pepcos financial exposure is the amount paid by Mirant to Pepco in respect of the PPA Related Obligations during the relevant period, less the amount realized by Mirant from the resale of the purchased energy and capacity. On this basis, Pepco estimates that if Mirant ultimately is successful in rejecting the PPA Related Obligations or on its alternative claims to recover payments made to Pepco related to the PPA Related Obligations, Pepcos maximum reimbursement obligation would be 77 approximately $263 million as of March 1, 2006. If Mirant were ultimately successful in its effort to reject its obligations relating to the Panda PPA, Pepco also would lose the benefit on a going forward basis of the offsetting transaction that negates the financial risk to Pepco of the Panda PPA. Accordingly, if Pepco were required to purchase capacity and energy from Panda commencing as of March 1, 2006, at the rates provided in the PPA (with an average price per kilowatt hour of approximately 17.1 cents), and resold the capacity and energy at market rates projected, given the characteristics of the Panda PPA, to be approximately 11.0 cents per kilowatt hour, Pepco estimates that it would incur losses of approximately $24 million for the remainder of 2006, approximately $30 million in 2007, and approximately $27 million to $38 million annually thereafter through the 2021 contract termination date. These estimates are based in part on current market prices and forward price estimates for e nergy and capacity, and do not include financing costs, all of which could be subject to significant fluctuation. Pepco is continuing to exercise all available legal remedies to vigorously oppose Mirants efforts to reject or recharacterize the PPA Related Obligations under the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement in order to protect the interests of its customers and shareholders. While Pepco believes that it has substantial legal bases to oppose these efforts by Mirant, the ultimate legal outcome is uncertain. However, if Pepco is required to repay to Mirant any amounts received from Mirant in respect of the PPA Related Obligations, Pepco believes it will be entitled to file a claim against the Mirant bankruptcy estate in an amount equal to the amount repaid. Likewise, if Mirant is successful in its efforts to reject its future obligations relating to the Panda PPA, Pepco will have a claim against Mirant in an amount corresponding to the increased costs that it would incur. In either case, Pepco anticipates that Mirant will contest the claim. To the extent Pepco is successful in its efforts to recover on these claims, it would receive, as in the case of the Pre Petition Claims, a number of shares of New Mirant Common Stock that is calculated using the market price of the New Mirant Common Stock on the Bankruptcy Emergence Date and accordingly would receive the benefit, and bear the risk, of any change in the market price of the stock between the Bankruptcy Emergence Date and the date the stock is issued to Pepco. Regulatory Recovery of Mirant Bankruptcy Losses If Mirant were ultimately successful in rejecting the PPA Related Obligations or on its alternative claims to recover payments made to Pepco related to the PPA Related Obligations and Pepcos corresponding claims against the Mirant bankruptcy estate are not recovered in full, Pepco would seek authority from the MPSC and the DCPSC to recover its additional costs. Pepco is committed to working with its regulatory authorities to achieve a result that is appropriate for its shareholders and customers. Under the provisions of the settlement agreements approved by the MPSC and the DCPSC in the deregulation proceedings in which Pepco agreed to divest its generation assets under certain conditions, the PPAs were to become assets of Pepcos distribution business if they could not be sold. Pepco believes that these provisions would allow the stranded costs of the PPAs that are not recovered from the Mirant bankruptcy estate to be recovered from Pepcos customers through its distribu tion rates. If Pepcos interpretation of the settlement agreements is confirmed, Pepco expects to be able to establish the amount of its anticipated recovery from customers as a regulatory asset. However, there is no assurance that Pepcos interpretation of the settlement agreements would be confirmed by the respective public service commissions. 78 Pepcos Notice of Administrative Claims On January 24, 2006, Pepco filed Notice of Administrative Claims in the Bankruptcy Court seeking to recover: (i) costs in excess of $70 million associated with the transmission upgrades necessitated by shut down of the Potomac River Power Station; and (ii) costs in excess of $8 million due to Mirants unjustified post petition delay in executing the certificates needed to permit Pepco to refinance certain tax exempt pollution control bonds. Mirant is expected to oppose both of these claims, which must be approved by the Bankruptcy Court. There is no assurance that Pepco will be able to recover the amounts claimed. Mirants Fraudulent Transfer Claim In July 2005, Mirant filed a complaint in the Bankruptcy Court against Pepco alleging that Mirants $2.65 billion purchase of Pepcos generating assets in June 2000 constituted a fraudulent transfer for which it seeks compensatory and punitive damages. Mirant alleges in the complaint that the value of Pepcos generation assets was "not fair consideration or fair or reasonably equivalent value for the consideration paid to Pepco" and that the purchase of the assets rendered Mirant insolvent, or, alternatively, that Pepco and Southern Energy, Inc. (as predecessor to Mirant) intended that Mirant would incur debts beyond its ability to pay them. Pepco believes this claim has no merit and is vigorously contesting the claim, which has been withdrawn to the District Court. On December 5, 2005, the District Court entered a stay pending a decision of the Court of Appeals in the appeals described above. The SMECO Agreement As a term of the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, Pepco assigned to Mirant a facility and capacity agreement with Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative (SMECO) under which Pepco was obligated to purchase the capacity of an 84 megawatt combustion turbine installed and owned by SMECO at a former Pepco generating facility (the SMECO Agreement). The SMECO Agreement expires in 2015 and contemplates a monthly payment to SMECO of approximately $.5 million. Pepco is responsible to SMECO for the performance of the SMECO Agreement if Mirant fails to perform its obligations thereunder. At this time, Mirant continues to make post petition payments due to SMECO. On March 15, 2004, Mirant filed a complaint with the Bankruptcy Court seeking a declaratory judgment that the SMECO Agreement is an unexpired lease of non residential real property rather than an executory contract and that if Mirant were to successfully reject the agreement, any claim against the bankruptcy estate for damages made by SMECO (or by Pepco as subrogee) would be subject to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code that limit the recovery of rejection damages by lessors. On November 22, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order granting summary judgment in favor of Mirant, finding that the SMECO Agreement is an unexpired lease of nonresidential real property. On the basis of this ruling, any claim by SMECO (or by Pepco as subrogee) for damages arising from a successful rejection are limited to the greater of (i) the amount of future rental payments due over one year, or (ii) 15% of the future rental payments due over the remaining term of the lease, not to exceed three years. 79 On December 1, 2005, Mirant filed both a motion with the Bankruptcy Court seeking to reject the SMECO Agreement and a complaint against Pepco and SMECO seeking to recover payments made to SMECO after the entry of the Bankruptcy Courts November 22, 2005 order holding that the SMECO Agreement is a lease of real property. On December 15, 2005, Pepco filed a motion with the District Court to withdraw jurisdiction of this matter from the Bankruptcy Court. The motion to withdraw and Mirants underlying motion and complaint have been stayed pending a decision of the Court of Appeals in the appeals described above. If the SMECO Agreement is successfully rejected by Mirant, Pepco will become responsible for the performance of the SMECO Agreement. In addition, if the SMECO Agreement is ultimately determined to be an unexpired lease of nonresidential real property, Pepcos claim for recovery against the Mirant bankruptcy estate would be limited as described above. Pepco estimates that its rejection claim, assuming the SMECO Agreement is determined to be an unexpired lease of nonresidential real property, would be approximately $8 million, and that the amount it would be obligated to pay over the remaining nine years of the SMECO Agreement is approximately $44.3 million. While that amount would be offset by the sale of capacity, under current projections, the market value of the capacity is de minimis. Rate Proceedings Delaware On October 3, 2005, DPL submitted its 2005 gas cost rate (GCR) filing to the DPSC, which permits DPL to recover gas procurement costs through customer rates. In its filing, DPL seeks to increase its GCR by approximately 38% in anticipation of increasing natural gas commodity costs. The proposed rate became effective November 1, 2005, subject to refund pending final Delaware Public Service Commission (DPSC) approval after evidentiary hearings. A public input hearing was held on January 19, 2006. DPSC staff and the Division of the Public Advocate filed testimony on February 20, 2006. As authorized by the April 16, 2002 settlement agreement in Delaware relating to the acquisition of Conectiv by Pepco (the Delaware Merger Settlement Agreement), on May 4, 2005, DPL filed with the DPSC a proposed increase of approximately $6.2 million in electric transmission service revenues, or about 1.1% of total Delaware retail electric revenues. This revenue increase covers the Delaware retail portion of the increase in the "Delmarva zonal" transmission rates on file with FERC under the PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) and other transition of PJM charges. This level of revenue increase will decrease to the extent that competitive suppliers provide the supply portion and its associated transmission service to retail customers. In that circumstance, PJM would charge the competitive retail supplier the PJM OATT rate for transmission service into the Delmarva zone and DPLs charges to the retail customer would exclude as a "shopping credit" an amount equal to th e SOS supply charge and the transmission and ancillary charges that would otherwise be charged by DPL to the retail customer. DPL began collecting this rate change for service rendered on and after June 3, 2005, subject to refund pending final approval by the DPSC. On September 1, 2005, DPL filed with the DPSC its first comprehensive base rate case in ten years. This application was filed as a result of increasing costs and is consistent with a provision in the Delaware Merger Settlement Agreement requiring DPL to file a base rate case by September 1, 2005 and permitting DPL to apply for an increase in rates to be effective no earlier 80 than May 1, 2006. In the application, DPL sought approval of an annual increase of approximately $5.1 million in its electric rates, with an increase of approximately $1.6 million to its electric distribution base rates after proposing to assign approximately $3.5 million in costs to the supply component of rates to be collected as part of the SOS. Of the approximately $1.6 million in net increases to its electric distribution base rates, DPL proposed that approximately $1.2 million be recovered through changes in delivery charges and that the remaining approximately $0.4 million be recovered through changes in premise collection and reconnect fees. The full proposed revenue increase is approximately 0.9% of total annual electric utility revenues, while the proposed net increase to distribution rates is 0.2% of total annual electric utility revenues. DPLs distribution revenue requirement is based on a proposed return on common equity of 11%. DPL also has proposed revised depreciation rates and a num ber of tariff modifications. On September 20, 2005, the DPSC issued an order approving DPLs request that the rate increase go into effect on May 1, 2006; subject to refund and pending evidentiary hearings. The order also suspends effectiveness of various proposed tariff rule changes until the case is concluded. The discovery process commenced on October 21, 2005. In its direct testimony, DPSC staff has proposed a variety of adjustments to rate base, operating expenses including depreciation and rate of return with an overall recommendation of a distribution base rate revenue decrease of $14.3 million. The DPSC staffs testimony also addresses issues such as rate design, allocation of any rate decrease and positions regarding the DPLs proposals on certain non rate tariff modifications. The Delaware Division of Public Advocate has proposed many of the same adjustments and others with an overall recommendation of a distribution base rate revenue decrease of $18.9 million. DPL filed rebuttal tes timony on January 17, 2006, which supports a distribution base rate revenue increase of $2 million. On January 30, 2006, the DPSC staff requested the Hearing Examiner approve a modification of the procedural schedule in the case to allow for inclusion of testimony regarding recalculation of DPSC staffs proposed depreciation rates to allow for a separate amortization of the cost of removal reserve. DPL objected to this modification of the procedural schedule. The Hearing Examiner issued a letter ruling on February 1, 2006, which denied DPSC staffs request for a modified procedural schedule. On February 2, 2006, DPSC staff filed an emergency motion requesting the DPSC to permit consideration of the issue by the Hearing Examiner in this docket. On February 6, 2006, the DPSC ruled to allow the issue in the case. A revised procedural schedule was established by the Hearing Examiner on February 10, 2006. On February 15, 2006, DPL filed an interlocutory appeal of the Hearing Examiners ruling on the p rocedural schedule with the DPSC. On February 28, 2006, the DPSC upheld the Hearing Examiners ruling and procedural schedule set on February 10, 2006. DPSC staff filed testimony related to this issue on February 17, 2006. DPSC staffs revised depreciation proposal reduces their recommended proposed rate decrease to $18.9 million, plus the amortization of the cost of removal of $58.4 million, which DPSC staff has recommended be returned to customers through either a 5 , 7 or 10 year amortization. DPL continues to oppose the inclusion of this issue in the case for substantive and procedural grounds. Evidentiary hearings were held in early February. Hearings on the separate issue related to the depreciation of the cost of removal are scheduled to be held March 20, 2006. Briefs are due on March 31, 2006 and DPSC deliberation is scheduled to occur on April 25, 2006. DPL cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. District of Columbia and Maryland On February 27, 2006, Pepco filed for the period February 8, 2002 through February 7, 2004 and for the period February 8, 2004 through February 7, 2005, an update to the District of 81 Columbia Generation Procurement Credit (GPC), which provides for sharing of the profit from SOS sales; and on February 24, 2006, Pepco filed an update for the period July1, 2003 through June 30, 2004 to the Maryland GPC. The updates to the GPC in both the District of Columbia and Maryland take into account the proceeds from the sale of the $105 million claim against the Mirant bankruptcy estate related to the TPA Settlement on December 13, 2005 for $112.4 million. The filings also incorporate true ups to previous disbursements in the GPC for both states. In the filings, Pepco requests that $24.3 million be credited to District of Columbia customers and $17.7 million be credited to Maryland customers during the twelve month period beginning April 2006. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission On January 31, 2005, Pepco, DPL, and ACE filed at FERC to reset their rates for network transmission service using a formula methodology. The companies also sought a 12.4% return on common equity and a 50 basis point return on equity adder that FERC had made available to transmission utilities who had joined Regional Transmission Organizations and thus turned over control of their assets to an independent entity. FERC issued an order on May 31, 2005, approving the rates to go into effect June 1, 2005, subject to refund, hearings, and further orders. The new rates reflect a decrease of 7.7% in Pepcos transmission rate, and increases of 6.5% and 3.3% in DPLs and ACEs transmission rates, respectively. The companies continue in settlement discussions under the supervision of a FERC administrative law judge and cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this proceeding. Restructuring Deferral Pursuant to orders issued by the NJBPU under New Jersey Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act (EDECA), beginning August 1, 1999, ACE was obligated to provide BGS to retail electricity customers in its service territory who did not choose a competitive energy supplier. For the period August 1, 1999 through July 31, 2003, ACEs aggregate costs that it was allowed to recover from customers exceeded its aggregate revenues from supplying BGS. These under recovered costs were partially offset by a $59.3 million deferred energy cost liability existing as of July 31, 1999 (LEAC Liability) that was related to ACEs Levelized Energy Adjustment Clause and ACEs Demand Side Management Programs. ACE established a regulatory asset in an amount equal to the balance of under recovered costs. In August 2002, ACE filed a petition with the NJBPU for the recovery of approximately $176.4 million in actual and projected deferred costs relating to the provision of BGS and other restructuring related costs incurred by ACE over the four year period August 1, 1999 through July 31, 2003, net of the $59.3 million offset for the LEAC Liability. The petition also requested that ACEs rates be reset as of August 1, 2003 so that there would be no under recovery of costs embedded in the rates on or after that date. The increase sought represented an overall 8.4% annual increase in electric rates and was in addition to the base rate increase discussed above. ACEs recovery of the deferred costs is subject to review and approval by the NJBPU in accordance with EDECA. In July 2004, the NJBPU issued a final order in the restructuring deferral proceeding confirming a July 2003 summary order, which (i) permitted ACE to begin collecting a portion of the deferred costs and reset rates to recover on going costs incurred as a result of EDECA, (ii) approved the recovery of $125 million of the deferred balance over a ten year amortization period beginning August 1, 2003, (iii) transferred to ACEs then pending base rate case for 82 further consideration approximately $25.4 million of the deferred balance, and (iv) estimated the overall deferral balance as of July 31, 2003 at $195 million, of which $44.6 million was disallowed recovery by ACE. ACE believes the record does not justify the level of disallowance imposed by the NJBPU in the final order. In August 2004, ACE filed with the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey, which hears appeals of New Jersey administrative agencies, including the NJBPU, a Notice of Appeal with respect to the July 2004 final order. ACEs initial brief was filed on August 17, 2005. Cross appellant briefs on behalf of the Division of the New Jersey Ratepayer Advocate and Cogentrix Energy Inc., the co owner of two cogeneration power plants with contracts to sell ACE approximately 397 megawatts of electricity, were filed on October 3, 2005. The NJBPU Staff filed briefs on December 12, 2005. ACE filed its reply briefs on January 30, 2006. Divestiture Cases District of Columbia Final briefs on Pepcos District of Columbia divestiture proceeds sharing application were filed in July 2002 following an evidentiary hearing in June 2002. That application was filed to implement a provision of Pepcos DCPSC approved divestiture settlement that provided for a sharing of any net proceeds from the sale of Pepcos generation related assets. One of the principal issues in the case is whether Pepco should be required to share with customers the excess deferred income taxes (EDIT) and accumulated deferred investment tax credits (ADITC) associated with the sold assets and, if so, whether such sharing would violate the normalization provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and its implementing regulations. As of December 31, 2005, the District of Columbia allocated portions of EDIT and ADITC associated with the divested generation assets were approximately $6.5 million and $5.8 million, respectively. Pepco believes that a sharing of EDIT and ADITC would violate the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) normalization rules. Under these rules, Pepco could not transfer the EDIT and the ADITC benefit to customers more quickly than on a straight line basis over the book life of the related assets. Since the assets are no longer owned there is no book life over which the EDIT and ADITC can be returned. If Pepco were required to share EDIT and ADITC and, as a result, the normalization rules were violated, Pepco would be unable to use accelerated depreciation on District of Columbia allocated or assigned property. In addition to sharing with customers the generation related EDIT and ADITC balances, Pepco would have to pay to the IRS an amount equal to Pepcos District of Columbia jurisdictional generation related ADITC balance ($5.8 million as of December 31, 2005), as well as its District of Columbia jurisdictional transmission and distribution related ADITC balance ($5.3 million as of December 31, 2005) in each case as those balances exist as of the later of the date a DCPSC order is issued and all rights to appeal have been exhausted or lapsed, or the date the DCPSC order becomes operative. In March 2003, the IRS issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR), which would allow for the sharing of EDIT and ADITC related to divested assets with utility customers on a prospective basis and at the election of the taxpayer on a retroactive basis. In December 2005 a revised NOPR was issued which, among other things, withdrew the March 2003 NOPR and eliminated the taxpayers ability to elect to apply the regulation retroactively. Comments on the revised NOPR are due by March 21, 2006, and a public hearing will be held on April 5, 2006. Pepco filed a letter with the DCPSC on January 12, 2006, in which it has reiterated that the DCPSC should continue to defer any decision on the ADITC and EDIT issues until the IRS issues final regulations or states that its regulations project will be terminated without the 83 issuance of any regulations. Other issues in the divestiture proceeding deal with the treatment of internal costs and cost allocations as deductions from the gross proceeds of the divestiture. Pepco believes that its calculation of the District of Columbia customers share of divestiture proceeds is correct. However, depending on the ultimate outcome of this proceeding, Pepco could be required to make additional gain sharing payments to District of Columbia customers, including the payments described above related to EDIT and ADITC. Such additional payments (which, other than the EDIT and ADITC related payments, cannot be estimated) would be charged to expense in the quarter and year in which a final decision is rendered and could have a material adverse effect on Pepcos and PHIs results of operations for those periods. However, neither PHI nor Pepco believes that additional gain sharing payments, if any, or the ADITC related payments to the IRS, if required, would have a material adverse impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. It is uncertain when the DCPSC will issue a decision regarding Pepcos divestiture proceeds sharing ap plication. Maryland Pepco filed its divestiture proceeds plan application in Maryland in April 2001. The principal issue in the Maryland case is the same EDIT and ADITC sharing issue that has been raised in the District of Columbia case. See the discussion above under "Divestiture Cases District of Columbia." As of December 31, 2005, the MPSC allocated portions of EDIT and ADITC associated with the divested generation assets were approximately $9.1 million and $10.4 million, respectively. Other issues deal with the treatment of certain costs as deductions from the gross proceeds of the divestiture. In November 2003, the Hearing Examiner in the Maryland proceeding issued a proposed order with respect to the application that concluded that Pepcos Maryland divestiture settlement agreement provided for a sharing between Pepco and customers of the EDIT and ADITC associated with the sold assets. Pepco believes that such a sharing would violate the normalization rules (discussed above ) and would result in Pepcos inability to use accelerated depreciation on Maryland allocated or assigned property. If the proposed order is affirmed, Pepco would have to share with its Maryland customers, on an approximately 50/50 basis, the Maryland allocated portion of the generation related EDIT ($9.1 million as of December 31, 2005), and the Maryland allocated portion of generation related ADITC. Furthermore, Pepco would have to pay to the IRS an amount equal to Pepcos Maryland jurisdictional generation related ADITC balance ($10.4 million as of December 31, 2005), as well as its Maryland retail jurisdictional ADITC transmission and distribution related balance ($9.5 million as of December 31, 2005), in each case as those balances exist as of the later of the date a MPSC order is issued and all rights to appeal have been exhausted or lapsed, or the date the MPSC order becomes operative. The Hearing Examiner decided all other issues in favor of Pepco, except for the dete rmination that only one half of the severance payments that Pepco included in its calculation of corporate reorganization costs should be deducted from the sales proceeds before sharing of the net gain between Pepco and customers. Pepco filed a letter with the MPSC on January 12, 2006, in which it has reiterated that the MPSC should continue to defer any decision on the ADITC and EDIT issues until the IRS issues final regulations or states that its regulations project will be terminated without the issuance of any regulations. 84 Pepco has appealed the Hearing Examiners decision as it relates to the treatment of EDIT and ADITC and corporate reorganization costs to the MPSC. Consistent with Pepcos position in the District of Columbia, Pepco has argued that the only prudent course of action is for the MPSC to await the issuance of final regulations relating to the tax issues or a termination by the IRS of its regulation project without the issuance of any regulations, and then allow the parties to file supplemental briefs on the tax issues. Pepco believes that its calculation of the Maryland customers share of divestiture proceeds is correct. However, depending on the ultimate outcome of this proceeding, Pepco could be required to share with its customers approximately 50 percent of the EDIT and ADITC balances described above and make additional gain sharing payments related to the disallowed severance payments. Such additional payments would be charged to expense in the quarter and year in which a final decision is rendered and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for those periods. However, neither PHI nor Pepco believes that additional gain sharing payments, if any, or the ADITC related payments to the IRS, if required, would have a material adverse impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Default Electricity Supply Proceedings District of Columbia Under an order issued by the DCPSC in March 2004, as amended by a DCPSC order issued in July 2004, Pepco is obligated to provide SOS for small commercial and residential customers through May 31, 2011 and for large commercial customers through May 31, 2007. In August 2004, the DCPSC issued an order adopting administrative charges for residential, small and large commercial District of Columbia SOS customers that are intended to allow Pepco to recover the administrative costs incurred to provide the SOS supply. The approved administrative charges include an average margin for Pepco of approximately $.00248 per kilowatt hour, calculated based on total sales to residential, small and large commercial District of Columbia SOS customers over the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. Because margins vary by customer class, the actual average margin over any given time period will depend on the number of SOS customers from each customer class and the load taken by such customers over the time period. The administrative charges went into effect for Pepcos SOS sales on February 8, 2005. The TPA with Mirant under which Pepco obtained the fixed rate SOS supply ended on January 22, 2005, while the new SOS supply contracts with the winning bidders in the competitive procurement process began on February 1, 2005. Pepco procured power separately on the market for next day deliveries to cover the period from January 23 through January 31, 2005, before the new SOS contracts began. Consequently, Pepco had to pay the difference between the procurement cost of power on the market for next day deliveries and the current SOS rates charged to customers during the period from January 23 through January 31, 2005. In addition, because the new SOS rates did not go into effect until February 8, 2005, Pepco had to pay the difference between the procurement cost of power under the new SOS contracts and the SOS rates charged to customers for the period from February 1 to February 7, 2005. The total amount of the difference is estimated to be approximately $8.7 million. This difference, however, was included in the calculation of the GPC for the District of Columbia for the period February 8, 2004 through February 7, 2005, which was filed on July 12, 2005 with the DCPSC. The GPC provides for a sharing between Pepcos customers and shareholders, on an annual basis, of any margins, but not losses, that Pepco earned providing SOS in the District of Columbia during the four year period from February 8, 2001 through February 7, 2005. At the 85 time of the filing, based on the rates paid to Mirant by Pepco under the TPA Settlement, there was no customer sharing. On December 22, 2005 Pepco received $112.4 million in proceeds from the sale of the Pepco TPA Claim against the Mirant bankruptcy estate. A portion of this recovery related to the period February 8, 2004 through February 7, 2005 covered in the July 12 DCPSC filing. As a consequence, on February 27, 2006, Pepco filed with the DCPSC an updated calculation of the customer sharing for this period, which also takes into account the losses incurred during the January 22, 2005 through February 7, 2005 period. The updated filing shows that both residential and commercial customers will receive customer sharing that totals $17.5 million. Without the inclusion of the $8.7 million loss from the January 22, 2005 through February 7, 2005 period, the amount shared with customers would have been approximately $22.7 million, or $5.2 million greater, so that the net effect of the loss on the SOS sal es during this period is approximately $3.5 million. On February 3, 2006, Pepco announced proposed rates for its District of Columbia SOS customers to take effect on June 1, 2006. The new rate will raise the average monthly bill for residential customers by approximately 12%. The proposed rates must be approved by the DCPSC. Delaware Under a settlement approved by the DPSC, DPL is required to provide POLR to customers in Delaware through April 2006. DPL is paid for POLR to customers in Delaware at fixed rates established in the settlement. DPL obtains all of the energy needed to fulfill its POLR obligations in Delaware under a supply agreement with its affiliate Conectiv Energy, which terminates in May 2006. DPL does not make any profit or incur any loss on the supply component of the POLR supply that it delivers to its Delaware customers. DPL is paid tariff delivery rates for the delivery of electricity over its transmission and distribution facilities to both POLR customers and customers who have selected another energy supplier. These delivery rates generally are frozen through April 2006, except that DPL is allowed to file for a one time transmission rate change during this period. On March 22, 2005, the DPSC issued an order approving DPL as the SOS provider after May 1, 2006, when DPLs cu rrent fixed rate POLR obligation ends. DPL will retain the SOS obligation for an indefinite period until changed by the DPSC, and will purchase the power supply required to satisfy its SOS obligations from wholesale suppliers under contracts entered into pursuant to a competitive bid procedure. On October 11, 2005, the DPSC approved a settlement agreement, under which DPL will provide SOS to all customer classes, with no specified termination date for SOS. Two categories of SOS will exist: (i) a fixed price SOS available to all but the largest customers; and (ii) an Hourly Priced Service (HPS) for the largest customers. DPL will purchase the power supply required to satisfy its fixed price SOS obligation from wholesale suppliers under contracts entered into pursuant to a competitive bid procedure. Power to supply the HPS customers will be acquired on next day and other short term PJM markets. In addition to the costs of capacity, energy, transmission, and ancillary services associated with the fixed price SOS and HPS, DPLs initial rates will include a component referred to as the Reasonable Allowance for Retail Margin (RARM). Components of the RARM include a fixed annual margin of $2.75 million, plus estimated incremental expenses, a cash working capital allo wance, and recovery with a return over five years of the capitalized costs of a billing system to be used for billing HPS customers. 86 Bids for fixed priced SOS supply for the May 1, 2006 through May 31, 2007 period were accepted and approved by the DPSC in December 2005 and January 2006. The new SOS rates are scheduled to be effective May 1, 2006. On February 7, 2006, the Governor of Delaware issued an Executive Order directing the DPSC and other state agencies to examine ways to mitigate the electric rate increases that are expected in May 2006 as a result of rising energy prices. The Executive Order directed the DPSC to examine the feasibility of: (1) deferring or phasing in the increases; (2) requiring DPL to build generation or enter into long term supply contracts to meet all, or a portion of, the SOS supply requirements under a traditional regulatory paradigm; (3) directing DPL to conduct integrated resource planning to ensure fuel diversity and least cost supply alternatives; and (4) requiring DPL to implement demand side management, conservation and energy efficient programs. In response to the Executive Order and to help facilitate discussion on several key issues facing the State of Delaware, particularly the issue of rising energy prices, DPL presented a proposed plan to the DPSC on February 28, 2006. A key feature of DPLs proposed plan is a phase in of rate increases to assist DPLs residential and small commercial customers with the impact of rising energy prices. The proposed phase in of the rate increase would be in three steps, with one third of the increase to be phased in on May 1, 2006, another one third on January 1, 2007 and the remainder on June 1, 2007. The phase in would create a deferral balance of approximately $60 million dollars that would accrue interest and would be recovered through a surcharge imposed for a 24 month period beginning June 1, 2007. DPL believes that this proposal offers a fair and reasonable solution to the concerns identified in the Executive Order. The Delaware Governors Cabinet Committee on Energy filed its report with the Governor on March 8, 2006. The report outlines a proposal that recommends: (1) a phase in of the SOS increase; (2) long term steps to ensure more stabilized prices and supply; (3) aggregation of the state of Delawares power needs; and (4) reduction of Delawares dependence on traditional energy sources through conservation, energy efficiency, and innovation. DPL intends to file with the DPSC, on or about March 15, 2006, an implementation plan with proposed tariffs based on its proposed phase in plan as described above. DPL also anticipates that others may advance other legislative or regulatory proposals to address the concerns expressed in the Executive Order. Accordingly, the nature and impact of any changes precipitated by the Executive Order are uncertain and DPL cannot predict at this time whether this phase in proposal will be implemented. Maryland Because of rising energy prices and the resultant expected increases in Pepcos and DPLs rates, on March 3, 2006 the MPSC issued an order initiating an investigation to consider a residential rate stabilization plan for Pepco and DPL. This investigation is driven by the unprecedented national and international events. The MPSC directed the MPSC staff, Pepco and DPL to file comments addressing whether or not the rate stabilization plan that the MPSC adopted for Baltimore Gas & Electric Company in a March 6, 2006 order also should be used for Pepco and DPL. Comments are to be filed by March 16, 2006. 87 On March 7, 2006, Pepco and DPL each announced the results of competitive bids to supply electricity to its Maryland SOS customers for one year beginning June 1, 2006. The proposed new rates must be approved formally by the MPSC. Due to significant increases in the cost of fuels used to generate electricity, the average monthly electric bill will increase by about 38.5% and 35% for Pepcos and DPLs Maryland residential customers, respectively. Virginia Under amendments to the Virginia Electric Utility Restructuring Act implemented in March 2004, DPL is obligated to offer Default Service to customers in Virginia for an indefinite period until relieved of that obligation by the VSCC. DPL currently obtains all of the energy and capacity needed to fulfill its Default Service obligations in Virginia under a supply agreement with Conectiv Energy that commenced on January 1, 2005 and expires in May 2006 (the 2005 Supply Agreement). A prior agreement, also with Conectiv Energy, terminated effective December 31, 2004. DPL entered into the 2005 Supply Agreement after conducting a competitive bid procedure in which Conectiv Energy was the lowest bidder. In October 2004, DPL filed an application with the VSCC for approval to increase the rates that DPL charges its Default Service customers to allow it to recover its costs for power under the 2005 Supply Agreement plus an administrative charge and a margin. A VSCC order issued in November 2004 allowed DPL to put interim rates into effect on January 1, 2005, subject to refund if the VSCC subsequently determined the rate is excessive. The interim rates reflected an increase of 1.0247 cents per Kwh to the fuel rate, which provide for recovery of the entire amount being paid by DPL to Conectiv Energy, but did not include an administrative charge or margin, pending further consideration of this issue. In January 2005, the VSCC ruled that the administrative charge and margin are base rate items not recoverable through a fuel clause. In March 2005, the VSCC approved a settlement resolving all other issues and making the interim rates final. On March 10, 2006, DPL filed a rate increase with the VSCC to reflect proposed rates for its Virginia Default Service customers to take effect on June 1, 2006. The new rates will raise the average monthly bill for residential customers by approximately 43%. The proposed rates must be approved by the VSCC. New Jersey On October 12, 2005, the NJBPU, following the evaluation of proposals submitted by ACE and the other three electric distribution companies located in New Jersey, issued an order reaffirming the current BGS auction process for the annual period from June 1, 2006 through May 2007. The NJBPU order maintains the current size and make up of the Commercial and Industrial Energy Pricing class (CIEP) and approved the electric distribution companies recommended approach for the CIEP auction product, but deferred a decision on the level of the retail margin funds. Proposed Shut Down of B.L. England Generating Facility In April 2004, pursuant to a NJBPU order, ACE filed a report with the NJBPU recommending that ACEs B.L. England generating facility, a 447 megawatt plant, be shut down. The report stated that, while operation of the B.L. England generating facility was necessary at the time of the report to satisfy reliability standards, those reliability standards could also be satisfied in 88 other ways. The report concluded that, based on B.L. Englands current and projected operating costs resulting from compliance with more restrictive environmental requirements, the most cost effective way in which to meet reliability standards is to shut down the B.L. England generating facility and construct additional transmission enhancements in southern New Jersey. In December 2004, ACE filed a petition with the NJBPU requesting that the NJBPU establish a proceeding that will consist of a Phase I and Phase II and that the procedural process for the Phase I proceeding require intervention and participation by all persons interested in the prudence of the decision to shut down B.L. England generating facility and the categories of stranded costs associated with shutting down and dismantling the facility and remediation of the site. ACE contemplates that Phase II of this proceeding, which would be initiated by an ACE filing in 2008 or 2009, would establish the actual level of prudently incurred stranded costs to be recovered from customers in rates. The NJBPU has not acted on this petition. In a January 24, 2006 Administrative Consent Order (ACO) among PHI, Conectiv, ACE, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) and the Attorney General of New Jersey, ACE agreed to shut down and permanently cease operations at the B.L. England generating facility by December 15, 2007 if ACE does not sell the plant. The shut down of the B.L. England generating facility will be subject to necessary approvals from the relevant agencies and the outcomes of the auction process, discussed under "ACE Auction of Generating Assets," below. ACE Auction of Generation Assets In May 2005, ACE announced that it would again auction its electric generation assets, consisting of its B.L. England generating facility and its ownership interests in the Keystone and Conemaugh generating stations. On November 15, 2005, ACE announced an agreement to sell its interests in the Keystone and Conemaugh generating stations to Duquesne Light Holdings Inc. for $173.1 million. The sale, subject to approval by the NJBPU as well as other regulatory agencies and certain other legal conditions, is expected to be completed mid year 2006. Based on the expressed need of the potential B.L. England bidders for the details of the ACO relating to the shut down of the plant that was being negotiated between ACE and the NJDEP, ACE elected to delay the final bid due date for B.L. England until such time as a final ACO was complete and available to bidders. With the January 24, 2006 execution of the ACO by all parties, ACE is proceeding with the auction process. Indicative bids were received on February 16, 2006 and final bids are scheduled to be submitted on or about April 19, 2006. Under the terms of sale, any successful bid for B.L. England must include assumption of all environmental liabilities associated with the plant in accordance with the auction standards previously issued by the NJBPU. 89 Any sale of B.L. England will not affect the stranded costs associated with the plant that already have been securitized. If B.L. England is sold, ACE anticipates that, subject to regulatory approval in Phase II of the proceeding described above, approximately $9.1 million of additional assets may be eligible for recovery as stranded costs. The net gains on the sale of the Keystone and Conemaugh generating stations will be an offset to stranded costs associated with the shutdown of B. L. England or will be offset through other ratemaking adjustments. Testimony filed by ACE with the NJBPU in December 2005 estimated net gains of approximately $126.9 million; however, the net gains ultimately realized will be dependent upon the timing of the closing of the sale of Keystone and Conemaugh generating stations, transaction costs and other factors. Federal Tax Treatment of Cross Border Leases PCI maintains a portfolio of cross border energy sale leaseback transactions, which, as of December 31, 2005, had a book value of approximately $1.3 billion, and from which PHI currently derives approximately $55 million per year in tax benefits in the form of interest and depreciation deductions. On February 11, 2005, the Treasury Department and IRS issued Notice 2005 13 informing taxpayers that the IRS intends to challenge on various grounds the purported tax benefits claimed by taxpayers entering into certain sale leaseback transactions with tax indifferent parties (i.e., municipalities, tax exempt and governmental entities), including those entered into on or prior to March 12, 2004 (the Notice). All of PCIs cross border energy leases are with tax indifferent parties and were entered into prior to 2004. In addition, on June 29, 2005 the IRS published a Coordinated Issue Paper concerning the resolution of audit issues related to such transactions. PCIs cross border energy leases are similar to those sale leaseback transactions described in the Notice and the Coordinated Issue Paper. PCIs leases have been under examination by the IRS as part of the normal PHI tax audit. On May 4, 2005, the IRS issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment to PHI that challenges the tax benefits realized from interest and depreciation deductions claimed by PHI with respect to these leases for the tax years 2001 and 2002. The tax benefits claimed by PHI with respect to these leases from 2001 through December 31, 2005 were approximately $230 million. The ultimate outcome of this issue is uncertain; however, if the IRS prevails, PHI would be subject to additional taxes, along with interest and possibly penalties on the additional taxes, which could have a material adverse effect on PHIs financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. PHI believes that its tax position related to these transactions was proper based on applicable statutes, regulations and case law, and intends to contest the final adjustments proposed by the IRS; however, there is no assurance that PHIs position will prevail. On November 18, 2005 the U.S. Senate passed The Tax Relief Act of 2005 (S.2020) which would apply passive loss limitation rules to leases with foreign tax indifferent parties effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2005, even if the leases were entered into on or prior to March 12, 2004. On December 8, 2005 the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Tax Relief Extension Reconciliation Act of 2005 (H.R. 4297), which does not contain any provision which would modify the current treatment of leases with tax indifferent parties. Enactment into law of a bill that is similar to S.2020 in its current form could result in a material delay of the income tax benefits that PCI would receive in connection with its cross border energy leases and thereby adversely affect PHIs financial condition and cash flows. The U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate are expected to hold a conference in the near 90 future to reconcile the differences in the two bills to determine the final legislation. Under SFAS No. 13, as currently interpreted, a settlement with the IRS or a change in tax law that results in a deferral of tax benefits that does not change the total estimated net income from a lease does not require an adjustment to the book value of the lease. However, if the IRS were to disallow, rather than require the deferral of, certain tax deductions related to PHIs leases, PHI would be required to adjust the book value of the leases and record a charge to earnings equal to the repricing impact of the disallowed deductions. Such a charge to earnings, if required, is likely to have a material adverse effect on PHIs financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for the period in which the charge is recorded. In July 2005, the FASB released a Proposed Staff Position paper that would amend SFAS No. 13 and require a lease to be repriced and the book value adjusted when there is a change or probable change in the timing of tax benefits. Under this proposal, a material change in the timing of cash flows under PHIs cross border leases as the result of a settlement with the IRS or a change in tax law also would require an adjustment to the book value. If adopted in its proposed form, the application of this guidance could result in a material adverse effect on PHIs financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, even if a resolution with the IRS or a change in tax law is limited to a deferral of the tax benefits realized by PCI from its leases. IRS Mixed Service Cost Issue During 2001, Pepco, DPL, and ACE changed their methods of accounting with respect to capitalizable construction costs for income tax purposes, which allow the companies to accelerate the deduction of certain expenses that were previously capitalized and depreciated. Through December 31, 2005, these accelerated deductions have generated incremental tax cash flow benefits of approximately $205 million (consisting of $94 million for Pepco, $62 million for DPL, and $49 million for ACE) for the companies, primarily attributable to their 2001 tax returns. On August 2, 2005, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 2005 53 (the Revenue Ruling) that will limit the ability of the companies to utilize this method of accounting for income tax purposes on their tax returns for 2004 and prior years. PHI intends to contest any IRS adjustment to its prior year income tax returns based on the Revenue Ruling. However, if the IRS is successful in applying this Revenue Ruling, Pepco, DPL, and ACE woul d be required to capitalize and depreciate a portion of the construction costs previously deducted and repay the associated income tax benefits, along with interest thereon. During 2005, PHI recorded a $10.9 million increase in income tax expense consisting of $6.0 million for Pepco, $2.9 million for DPL, and $2.0 million for ACE, to account for the accrued interest that would be paid on the portion of tax benefits that PHI estimates would be deferred to future years if the construction costs previously deducted are required to be capitalized and depreciated. On the same day as the Revenue Ruling was issued, the Treasury Department released regulations that, if adopted in their current form, would require Pepco, DPL, and ACE to change their method of accounting with respect to capitalizable construction costs for income tax purposes for all future tax periods beginning in 2005. Under these regulations, Pepco, DPL, and ACE will have to capitalize and depreciate a portion of the construction costs that they have previously deducted and include the impact of this adjustment in taxable income over a two year period beginning with tax year 2005. PHI is continuing to work with the industry to determine an alternative method of accounting for capitalizable construction costs acceptable to the IRS to replace the method disallowed by the proposed regulations. 91 In February 2006, PHI paid approximately $121 million of taxes to cover the amount of taxes management estimates will be payable once a new final method of tax accounting is adopted on its 2005 tax return, due to the proposed regulations. Although the increase in taxable income will be spread over the 2005 and 2006 tax return periods, the cash payments would have all occurred in 2006 with the filing of the 2005 tax return and the ongoing 2006 estimated tax payments. This $121 million tax payment was accelerated to eliminate the need to accrue additional federal interest expense for the potential IRS adjustment related to the previous tax accounting method PHI used during the 2001 2004 tax years. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES General The SEC has defined a companys most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates represent those estimates and assumptions that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and that have a material impact on financial condition or operating performance. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, such as Statement of Position 94 6, "Disclosure of Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties," requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Examples of significant estimates used by Pepco Holdings include the assessment of contingencies and the need/amount for reserves of future receipts from Mirant (see "Relationship with Mirant Corporation"), the calculation of future cash flows and fair value amounts for use in goodwill and asset impairment evaluations, fair value calculations (based on estimated market pricing) associated with derivative instruments, pension and other postretirement benefits assumptions, unbilled revenue calculations, and the judgment involved with assessing the probability of recovery of regulatory assets. Additionally, PHI is subject to legal, regulatory, and other proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Pepco Holdings records an estimated liability for these proceedings and claims based upon the probable and reasonably estimable criteria contained in SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies." Although Pepco Holdings believes that its estimates and assu mptions are reasonable, they are based upon information available to management at the time the estimates are made. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. 92 Goodwill Impairment Evaluation Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in its goodwill impairment evaluation process represent "Critical Accounting Estimates" because (i) they may be susceptible to change from period to period because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about the discounting of future cash flows, which are inherently uncertain, (ii) actual results could vary from those used in Pepco Holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material, and (iii) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on Pepco Holdings assets and the net loss related to an impairment charge could be material. The provisions of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," require the evaluation of goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. SFAS No. 142 indicates that if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill, an impairment charge may be necessary. The goodwill generated in the transaction by which Pepco acquired Conectiv in 2002 was allocated to Pepco Holdings Power Delivery segment. In order to estimate the fair value of its Power Delivery segment, Pepco Holdings discounts the estimated future cash flows associated with the segment using a discounted cash flow model with a single interest rate that is commensurate with the risk involved with such an investment. The estimation of fair value is dependent on a number of factors, including but not limited to interest rates, future growth assumptions, operating and capital expenditu re requirements and other factors, changes in which could materially impact the results of impairment testing. Pepco Holdings tested its goodwill for impairment as of July 1, 2005. This testing concluded that Pepco Holdings goodwill balance was not impaired. A hypothetical decrease in the Power Delivery segments forecasted cash flows of 10 percent would not have resulted in an impairment charge. Long Lived Assets Impairment Evaluation Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in its long lived asset impairment evaluation process represent "Critical Accounting Estimates" because (i) they are highly susceptible to change from period to period because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about undiscounted and discounted future cash flows and fair values, which are inherently uncertain, (ii) actual results could vary from those used in Pepco Holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material, and (iii) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on Pepco Holdings assets as well as the net loss related to an impairment charge could be material. SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," requires that certain long lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss may only be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. The asset is deemed not to be recoverable when its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. In order to estimate an assets future cash flows, Pepco Holdings considers historical cash flows. Pepco Holdings uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel costs, legislative initiatives, and operating costs. The process of determining fair value is done consistent with the process described in assessing the fair val ue of goodwill, which is discussed above. 93 Derivative Instruments Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in accounting for its derivative instruments represent "Critical Accounting Estimates" because (i) the fair value of the instruments are highly susceptible to changes in market value and interest rate fluctuations, (ii) there are significant uncertainties in modeling techniques used to measure fair value in certain circumstances, (iii) actual results could vary from those used in Pepco Holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material, and (iv) changes in fair values and market prices could result in material impacts to Pepco Holdings assets, liabilities, other comprehensive income (loss), and results of operations. See Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting for Derivatives" to the consolidated financial statements of PHI included in Item 8 for information on PHIs accounting for derivatives. Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments primarily to manage risk associated with commodity prices and interest rates. SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended, governs the accounting treatment for derivatives and requires that derivative instruments be measured at fair value. The fair value of derivatives is determined using quoted exchange prices where available. For instruments that are not traded on an exchange, external broker quotes are used to determine fair value. For some custom and complex instruments, an internal model is used to interpolate broker quality price information. The same valuation methods are used to determine the value of non derivative, commodity exposure for risk management purposes. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in reporting the costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefits represent "Critical Accounting Estimates" because (i) they are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of assumptions which are subjective in nature, (ii) they are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience, and (iii) changes in assumptions could impact Pepco Holdings expected future cash funding requirements for the plans and would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations, the reported pension and other postretirement benefit liability on the balance sheet, and the reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost on the income statement. In terms of quantifying the anticipated impact of a change in assumptions, Pepco Holdings estimates that a .25% change in the discount rate used to value the benefit obligations could result in a $ 5 million impact on its consolidated balance sheets and statements of earnings. Additionally, Pepco Holdings estimates that a .25% change in the expected return on plan assets could result in a $4 million impact on the consolidated balance sheets and statements of earnings and a .25% change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate could result in a $.5 million impact on its consolidated balance sheets and statements of earnings. Pepco Holdings management consults with its actuaries and investment consultants when selecting its plan assumptions. Pepco Holdings follows the guidance of SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," when accounting for these benefits. Under these accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. In accordance with these standards, the impact of changes in these assumptions and the difference between actual and expected or estimated results on pension and postretirement obligations is generally recognized over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans rather 94 than immediately recognized in the statement of earnings. Plan assets are stated at their market value as of the measurement date, which is December 31. Regulation of Power Delivery Operations The requirements of SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," apply to the Power Delivery businesses of Pepco, DPL, and ACE. Pepco Holdings believes that the judgment involved in accounting for its regulated activities represent "Critical Accounting Estimates" because (i) a significant amount of judgment is required (including but not limited to the interpretation of laws and regulatory commission orders) to assess the probability of the recovery of regulatory assets, (ii) actual results and interpretations could vary from those used in Pepco Holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material, and (iii) the impact that writing off a regulatory asset would have on Pepco Holdings assets and the net loss related to the charge could be material. Unbilled Revenue Unbilled revenue represents an estimate of revenue earned from services rendered by Pepco Holdings utility operations that have not yet been billed. Pepco Holdings utility operations calculate unbilled revenue using an output based methodology. This methodology is based on the supply of electricity or gas distributed to customers. Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in its unbilled revenue process represent "Critical Accounting Estimates" because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about input factors such as customer sales mix and estimated power line losses (estimates of electricity expected to be lost in the process of its transmission and distribution to customers), all of which are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change from period to period, the impact of which could be material. New Accounting Standards SFAS No. 154 In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (SFAS No. 154), a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3." SFAS No. 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. It establishes, unless impracticable, retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle. The reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements is also addressed by SFAS No. 154. This Statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005 (the year ended December 31, 2006 for Pepco Holdings). Early adoption is permitted. SFAS No. 155 In February 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 155, "Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140" (SFAS No. 155). This Statement amends FASB Statements No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", and No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities." This Statement resolves issues addressed in Statement 133 Implementation Issue No. D1, "Application of Statement 133 to Beneficial Interests in 95 Securitized Financial Assets." SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. Pepco Holdings is in the process of evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 155 but does not anticipate that its implementation will have a material impact on Pepco Holdings overall financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. SAB 107 and SFAS No. 123R In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) which provides implementation guidance on the interaction between FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share Based Payment" (SFAS No. 123R), and certain SEC rules and regulations, as well as guidance on the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies. In April 2005, the SEC adopted a rule delaying the effective date of SFAS No. 123R for public companies. Under the rule, most registrants must comply with SFAS No. 123R beginning with the first interim or annual reporting period of their first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005 (the year ended December 31, 2006 for Pepco Holdings). In November 2005, the FASB published FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 123R 3, "Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards" (FSP FAS 123R 3), which provides guidance regarding an alternative transition election for accounting for the tax effects of share based payments. FSP FAS 123R 3 was effective upon issuance. In February 2006, the FASB published FASB Staff Position FAS 123(R) 4, "Classification of Options and Similar Instruments Issued as Employee Compensation that Allow for Cash Settlement upon the Occurrence of a Contingent Event" (FSP FAS 123(R) 4), which incorporate the concept of when cash settlement features of options and similar instruments meet the condition outlined in SAFS No. 123R. FSP FAS 123(R) 4 is effective upon initial adoption of SFAS No.123R or the first reporting period after its issuance, if SFAS No. 123R has been adopted. Pepco Holdings is in the process of completing its evaluation of the impact of SFAS No. 123R, FSP FAS 123(R) 3, and FSP FAS 123(R) 4, and does not anticipate that their implementation or SAB 107 will have a material effect on Pepco Holdings overall financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. FIN 47 Pepco Holdings adopted FASB Interpretation No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations" (FIN 47), on December 31, 2005. A conditional asset retirement obligation refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity applies even though uncertainty exists about the time and or method of settlement. FIN 47 requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation, when incurred, if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of the conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. In adopting FIN 47, Pepco Holdings identified that it has asset retirement obligations to (1) remove retired underground storage tanks located in multiple locations, (2) cap and monitor an 96 ash disposal site, (3) remove asbestos at one generating station and (4) remove thermal equipment installed under contract with a Delaware court house at the termination of the contract. As a result of these obligations, during 2005 Pepco Holdings recorded both a conditional asset retirement obligation of $1.5 million and a de minimis transition liability. Accretion expense for 2005 which relates to the Power Delivery segment has been recorded as a regulatory asset. EITF 04 13 In September 2005, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 04 13, "Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty" (EITF 04 13), which addresses circumstances under which two or more exchange transactions involving inventory with the same counterparty should be viewed as a single exchange transaction for the purposes of evaluating the effect of APB Opinion 29. EITF 04 13 is effective for new arrangements entered into, or modifications or renewals of existing arrangements, beginning in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after March 15, 2006 (April 1, 2006 for Pepco Holdings). EITF 04 13 would not affect Pepco Holdings net income, overall financial condition, or cash flows, but rather could result in certain revenues and costs, including wholesale revenues and purchased power expenses, being presented on a net basis. Pepco Holdings is in the process of evaluating the impact of EITF 04 13 on its Consolidated Statements of Earnings pre sentation of purchases and sales. RISK FACTORS The businesses of PHI and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the events or conditions identified below. The occurrence of one or more of these events or conditions could have an adverse effect on the business of PHI and its subsidiaries, including, depending on the circumstances, their financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. PHI and its subsidiaries are subject to substantial governmental regulation. If PHI or any of its subsidiaries receives unfavorable regulatory treatment, PHIs business could be negatively affected. PHIs Power Delivery businesses are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local regulatory agencies that significantly affects their operations. Each of Pepco, DPL and ACE is regulated by state public service commissions in its service territories, with respect to, among other things, the rates it can charge retail customers for the supply and distribution of electricity (and additionally for DPL the supply and distribution of gas). In addition, the rates that the companies can charge for electricity transmission are regulated by FERC. The companies cannot change supply, distribution, or transmission rates without approval by the applicable regulatory authority. While the approved distribution and transmission rates are intended to permit the companies to recover their costs of service and earn a reasonable rate of return, the profitability of the companies is affected by the rates they are able to charge. In addition, if the costs incurred by any of the companies in operating its transmission and distribution facilities exceed the allowed amounts for costs included in the approved rates, the financial results of that company, and correspondingly, PHI, will be adversely affected. PHIs subsidiaries also are required to have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from governmental agencies that regulate their businesses. PHI believes that its subsidiaries have 97 obtained or sought renewal of the material permits, approvals and certificates necessary for their existing operations and that their businesses are conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, PHI is unable to predict the impact of future regulatory activities of any of these agencies on its business. Changes in or reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations, or the imposition of new laws or regulations, may require PHIs subsidiaries to incur additional expenses or to change the way they conduct their operations. PHIs business could be adversely affected by the Mirant bankruptcy. In 2000, Pepco sold substantially all of its electricity generation assets to Mirant. As part of the sale, Pepco entered into several ongoing contractual arrangements with Mirant and certain of its subsidiaries. On July 14, 2003, Mirant and most of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas. Depending on the outcome of the proceedings related to the bankruptcy, the Mirant bankruptcy could adversely affect PHIs business. See "Relationship with Mirant Corporation" for additional information. Pepco may be required to make additional divestiture proceeds gain sharing payments to customers in the District of Columbia and Maryland. Pepco currently is involved in regulatory proceedings in Maryland and the District of Columbia related to the sharing of the net proceeds from the sale of its generation related assets. The principal issue in the proceedings is whether Pepco should be required to share with customers the excess deferred income taxes and accumulated deferred investment tax credits associated with the sold assets and, if so, whether such sharing would violate the normalization provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and its implementing regulations. Depending on the outcome of the proceedings, Pepco could be required to make additional gain sharing payments to customers and payments to the IRS in the amount of the associated accumulated deferred investment tax credits, and Pepco might be unable to use accelerated depreciation on District of Columbia and Maryland allocated or assigned property. See "Regulatory and Other Matters" for additional information. The operating results of PHIs Power Delivery and Competitive Energy businesses fluctuate on a seasonal basis and can be adversely affected by changes in weather. PHIs Power Delivery and Competitive Energy businesses are seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on their operating performance. Demand for electricity is generally greater in the summer months associated with cooling and demand for electricity and gas is generally greater in the winter months associated with heating as compared to other times of the year. Historically, the competitive energy operations of Conectiv Energy and Pepco Energy Services have produced less revenues when weather conditions are milder than normal. Such weather conditions can also negatively impact income from these operations. Energy management services generally are not seasonal. The facilities of PHIs subsidiaries may not operate as planned or may require significant maintenance expenditures, which could decrease their revenues or increase their expenses. 98 Operation of generation, transmission and distribution facilities involves many risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment, accidents, labor disputes and performance below expected levels. Older facilities and equipment, even if maintained in accordance with sound engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures for additions or upgrades to keep them operating at peak efficiency, to comply with changing environmental requirements, or to provide reliable operations. Natural disasters and weather related incidents, including tornadoes, hurricanes and snow and ice storms, also can disrupt generation, transmission and distribution delivery systems. Operation of generation, transmission and distribution facilities below expected capacity levels can reduce revenues and result in the incurrence of additional expenses that may not be recoverable from customers or through insurance. Furthermore, if PHIs operating subsidiaries are unable to pe rform their contractual obligations for any of these reasons, they may incur penalties or damages. The transmission facilities of PHIs Power Delivery business are interconnected with the facilities of other transmission facility owners whose actions could have a negative impact on the operations of PHIs subsidiaries. The transmission facilities of Pepco, DPL and ACE are directly interconnected with the transmission facilities of contiguous utilities and, as such, are part of an interstate power transmission grid. FERC has designated a number of regional transmission operators to coordinate the operation of portions of the interstate transmission grid. Each of Pepco, DPL and ACE is a member of PJM, which is the regional transmission operator that coordinates the movement of electricity in all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Pepco, DPL and ACE operate their transmission facilities under the direction and control of PJM. PJM and the other regional transmission operators have established sophisticated systems that are designed to ensure the reliability of the operation of transmission facilities and prevent the operations of one uti lity from having an adverse impact on the operations of the other utilities. However, the systems put in place by PJM and the other regional transmission operators may not always be adequate to prevent problems at other utilities from causing service interruptions in the transmission facilities of Pepco, DPL or ACE. If any of Pepco, DPL or ACE were to suffer such a service interruption, it could have a negative impact on its and PHIs business. The cost of compliance with environmental laws is significant and new environmental laws may increase the expenses of PHI and its subsidiaries. The operations of PHIs subsidiaries, both regulated and unregulated, are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations, relating to air quality, water quality, spill prevention, waste management, natural resources, site remediation, and health and safety. These laws and regulations require PHIs subsidiaries to make capital expenditures and to incur other expenditures to, among other things, meet emissions standards, conduct site remediation and perform environmental monitoring. PHIs subsidiaries also may be required to pay significant remediation costs with respect to third party sites. If PHIs subsidiaries fail to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond their control, such failure could result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities and the need to expend significant sums to come into compliance. 99 In addition, PHIs subsidiaries incur costs to obtain and comply with a variety of environmental permits, licenses, inspections and other approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval, or if PHIs subsidiaries fail to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, operations at affected facilities could be halted or subjected to additional costs. New environmental laws and regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, could impose more stringent limitations on the operations of PHIs subsidiaries or require them to incur significant additional costs. PHIs current compliance strategy may not successfully address the relevant standards and interpretations of the future. Failure to retain and attract key skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on the operations of PHI. Implementation of PHIs strategy is dependent on its ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees. Competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the inability to retain and attract these employees could adversely affect PHIs business, operations, and financial condition. PHIs Competitive Energy businesses are highly competitive. The unregulated energy generation, supply and marketing businesses in the mid Atlantic region are characterized by intense competition at both the wholesale and retail levels. PHIs Competitive Energy businesses compete with numerous non utility generators, independent power producers, wholesale and retail energy marketers, and traditional utilities. This competition generally has the effect of reducing margins and requires a continual focus on controlling costs. PHIs Competitive Energy businesses rely on some transmission, storage, and distribution assets that they do not own or control to deliver wholesale and retail electricity and natural gas and to obtain fuel for their generation facilities. PHIs Competitive Energy businesses depend upon electric transmission facilities, natural gas pipelines, and gas storage facilities owned and operated by others. The operation of their generation facilities also depends upon coal, natural gas or diesel fuel supplied by others. If electric transmission, natural gas pipelines, or gas storage are disrupted or capacity is inadequate or unavailable, the Competitive Energy businesses ability to buy and receive and or sell and deliver wholesale and retail power and natural gas, and therefore to fulfill their contractual obligations, could be adversely affected. Similarly, if the fuel supply to one or more of their generation plants is disrupted and storage or other alternative sources of supply are not available, the Competitive Energy businesses ability to operate their generating facilities could be adversely affected. Changes in technology may adversely affect PHIs Power Delivery and Competitive Energy businesses. Research and development activities are ongoing to improve alternative technologies to produce electricity, including fuel cells, micro turbines and photovoltaic (solar) cells. It is possible that advances in these or other alternative technologies will reduce the costs of electricity production from these technologies, thereby making the generating facilities of PHIs Competitive Energy businesses less competitive. In addition, increased conservation efforts and 100 advances in technology could reduce demand for electricity supply and distribution, which could adversely affect PHIs Power Delivery and Competitive Energy businesses. Changes in technology also could alter the channels through which retail electric customers buy electricity, which could adversely affect PHIs Power Delivery business. PHIs risk management procedures may not prevent losses in the operation of its Competitive Energy businesses. The operations of PHIs Competitive Energy businesses are conducted in accordance with sophisticated risk management systems that are designed to quantify risk. However, actual results sometimes deviate from modeled expectations. In particular, risks in PHIs energy activities are measured and monitored utilizing value at risk models to determine the effects of potential one day favorable or unfavorable price movements. These estimates are based on historical price volatility and assume a normal distribution of price changes and a 95% probability of occurrence. Consequently, if prices significantly deviate from historical prices, PHIs risk management systems, including assumptions supporting risk limits, may not protect PHI from significant losses. In addition, adverse changes in energy prices may result in economic losses in PHIs earnings and cash flows and reductions in the value of assets on its balance sheet under applicable accounting rules. The commodity hedging procedures used by PHIs Competitive Energy businesses may not protect them from significant losses caused by volatile commodity prices. To lower the financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, PHIs Competitive Energy businesses routinely enter into contracts to hedge the value of their assets and operations. As part of this strategy, PHIs Competitive Energy businesses utilize fixed price, forward, physical purchase and sales contracts, tolling agreements, futures, financial swaps and option contracts traded in the over the counter markets or on exchanges. Each of these various hedge instruments can carry a unique set of risks in their application to PHIs energy assets. PHI must apply judgment in determining the application and effectiveness of each hedge instrument. Changes in accounting rules, or revised interpretations to existing rules, may cause hedges to be deemed ineffective. This could have material earnings implications for the period or periods in question. Conectiv Energys objective is to hedge a portion of the expected power output of its generation facilities and the costs of fuel used to operate those facilities so it is not completely exposed to spot energy price movements. Hedge targets are approved by PHIs Corporate Risk Management Committee and may change from time to time based on market conditions. Conectiv Energy generally establishes hedge targets annually for the next three succeeding 12 month periods. Within a given 12 month horizon, the actual hedged positioning any month may be outside of the targeted range, even if the average for a 12 month period falls within the stated range. Management exercises judgment in determining which months present the most significant risk, or opportunity, and hedge levels are adjusted accordingly. Since energy markets can move significantly in a short period of time, hedge levels may also be adjusted to reflect revised assumptions. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, changes in projected plant output, revisions to fuel requirements, transmission constraints, prices of alternate fuels, and improving or deteri orating supply and demand conditions. In addition, short term occurrences, such as abnormal weather, operational events, or intra month commodity price volatility may also cause the actual level of hedging coverage to vary from the established hedge targets. These events can cause fluctuations in PHIs earnings from period to period. Due to the high heat rate of the Pepco Energy Services generation facilities, Pepco Energy Services generally does not enter into wholesale contracts to lock in the forward value of its plants. To the extent 101 that PHIs Competitive Energy businesses have unhedged positions or their hedging procedures do not work as planned, fluctuating commodity prices could result in significant losses. Conversely, by engaging in hedging activities, PHI may not realize gains that otherwise could result from fluctuating commodity prices. Acts of terrorism could adversely affect PHIs businesses. The threat of, or actual acts of, terrorism may affect the operations of PHI and its subsidiaries in unpredictable ways and may cause changes in the insurance markets, force PHI and its subsidiaries to increase security measures and cause disruptions of fuel supplies and markets. If any of PHIs infrastructure facilities, such as its electric generation, fuel storage, transmission or distribution facilities, were to be a direct target, or an indirect casualty, of an act of terrorism, its operations could be adversely affected. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism also could affect the ability of PHI and its subsidiaries to raise needed capital. The insurance coverage of PHI and its subsidiaries may not be sufficient to cover all casualty losses that they might incur. PHI and its subsidiaries currently have insurance coverage for their facilities and operations in amounts and with deductibles that they consider appropriate. However, there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, some risks, such as weather related casualties, may not be insurable. In the case of loss or damage to property, plant or equipment, there is no assurance that the insurance proceeds, if any, received will be sufficient to cover the entire cost of replacement or repair. PHI and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected by economic conditions. Periods of slowed economic activity generally result in decreased demand for power, particularly by industrial and large commercial customers. As a consequence, recessions or other downturns in the economy may result in decreased revenues and cash flows for PHIs Power Delivery and Competitive Energy businesses. The IRS challenge to cross border energy sale and lease back transactions entered into by a PHI subsidiary could result in loss of prior and future tax benefits. PCI maintains a portfolio of cross border energy sale leaseback transactions, which as of December 31, 2005, had a book value of approximately $1.3 billion and from which PHI currently derives approximately $55 million per year in tax benefits in the form of interest and depreciation deductions. All of PCIs cross border energy leases are with tax indifferent parties and were entered into prior to 2004. On February 11, 2005, the Treasury Department and IRS issued a notice informing taxpayers that the IRS intends to challenge the tax benefits claimed by taxpayers with respect to certain of these transactions. In addition, on June 29, 2005, the IRS published a Coordinated Issue Paper concerning the resolution of audit issues related to such transactions. PCIs leases have been under examination by the IRS as part of the normal PHI tax audit. On May 4, 2005, the IRS issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment to PHI that challenges the tax benefits realized from interest and depreciation deductions claimed by PHI with respect to these leases for the tax years 2001 and 2002. The tax benefits claimed by PHI with respect to these leases from 2001 through December 31, 2005 were approximately $230 million. The ultimate 102 outcome of this issue is uncertain; however, if the IRS prevails, PHI would be subject to additional taxes, along with interest and possibly penalties on the additional taxes, which could have a material adverse effect on PHIs results of operations and cash flows. In addition, a disallowance, rather than a deferral, of tax benefits to be realized by PHI from these leases will require PHI to adjust the book value of its leases and record a charge to earnings equal to the repricing impact of the disallowed deductions. Such a change would likely have a material adverse effect on PHIs results of operations for the period in which the charge is recorded. See "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Regulatory and Other Matters" for additional information. Pending tax legislation could result in a loss of future tax benefits from cross border energy sale and lease back transactions entered into by a PHI subsidiary. On November 18, 2005, the U.S. Senate passed The Tax Relief Act of 2005 (S.2020) which would apply passive loss limitation rules to leases with foreign tax indifferent parties effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2005, even if the leases were entered into on or prior to March 12, 2004. On December 8, 2005, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Tax Relief Extension Reconciliation Act of 2005 (H.R. 4297), which does not contain any provision which would modify the current treatment of leases with tax indifferent parties. Enactment into law of a bill that is similar to S.2020 in its current form could result in a material delay of the income tax benefits that PCI would receive in connection with its cross border energy leases and thereby adversely affect PHIs cash flow. The U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate are expected to hold a conference in the near future to reconcile the differences in the two bills to determine the final legis lation. In July 2005, the FASB released a Proposed Staff Position paper that would amend SFAS No. 13 and require a lease to be repriced and the book value adjusted when there is a change or probable change in the timing of tax benefits. Adoption of this Proposed Staff Position Paper and enactment of a bill that is similar to S.2020 could result in a material adverse effect on PHIs results of operations and cash flows. See "Regulatory and Other Matters" for additional information. IRS Revenue Ruling 2005 53 on Mixed Service Costs could require PHI to incur additional tax and interest payments in connection with the IRS audit of this issue for the tax years 2001 through 2004 (IRS Revenue Ruling 2005 53). During 2001, Pepco, DPL, and ACE changed their methods of accounting with respect to capitalizable construction costs for income tax purposes, which allow the companies to accelerate the deduction of certain expenses that were previously capitalized and depreciated. Through December 31, 2005, these accelerated deductions have generated incremental tax cash flow benefits of approximately $205 million (consisting of $94 million for Pepco, $62 million for DPL, and $49 million for ACE) for the companies, primarily attributable to their 2001 tax returns. On August 2, 2005, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 2005 53 (the Revenue Ruling) that will limit the ability of the companies to utilize this method of accounting for income tax purposes on their tax returns for 2004 and prior years. PHI intends to contest any IRS adjustment to its prior year income tax returns based on the Revenue Ruling. However, if the 103 IRS is successful in applying this Revenue Ruling, Pepco, DPL, and ACE would be required to capitalize and depreciate a portion of the construction costs previously deducted and repay the associated income tax benefits, along with interest thereon. During 2005, PHI recorded a $10.9 million increase in income tax expense, consisting of $6.0 million for Pepco, $2.9 million for DPL, and $2.0 million for ACE, to account for the accrued interest that would be paid on the portion of tax benefits that PHI estimates would be deferred to future years if the construction costs previously deducted are required to be capitalized and depreciated. On the same day as the Revenue Ruling was issued, the Treasury Department released regulations that, if adopted in their current form, would require Pepco, DPL, and ACE to change their method of accounting with respect to capitalizable construction costs for income tax purposes for all future tax periods beginning in 2005. Under these regulations, Pepco, DPL, and ACE will have to capitalize and depreciate a portion of the construction costs that they have previously deducted, and include the impact of this adjustment in taxable income over a two year period beginning with tax year 2005. PHI is working with the industry to identify an alternative method of accounting for capitalizable construction costs acceptable to the IRS to replace the method disallowed by the proposed regulations. In February 2006, PHI paid approximately $121 million of taxes to cover the amount of taxes management estimates will be payable once a new final method of tax accounting is adopted on its 2005 tax return, due to the proposed regulations. Although the increase in taxable income will be spread over the 2005 and 2006 tax return periods, the cash payments would have all occurred in 2006 with the filing of the 2005 tax return and the ongoing 2006 estimated tax payments. This $121 million tax payment was accelerated to eliminate the need to accrue additional Federal interest expense for the potential IRS adjustment related to the previous tax accounting method PHI used during the 2001 2004 tax years. PHI believes that the $121 million tax payment is a reasonable estimate, based on current information, of the additional taxes that will be due once a new method of tax accounting is adopted. For the 2001 through 2004 period currently under audit by the IRS, there is a risk that the IRS could successfully challenge the tax accounting method utilized in 2001 through 2004, and assert additional taxes above the $121 million payment. If the IRS were to be successful in this contention, PHI would be responsible for the additional taxes above the $121 million amount, as well as interest on the additional taxes. PHI and its subsidiaries are dependent on their ability to successfully access capital markets. An inability to access capital may adversely affect their business. PHI and its subsidiaries rely on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity and to satisfy their capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from their operations. Capital market disruptions, or a downgrade in credit ratings of PHI or its subsidiaries, could increase the cost of borrowing or could adversely affect their ability to access one or more financial markets. In addition, a reduction in PHIs credit ratings could require PHI or its subsidiaries to post additional collateral in connection with some of its wholesale marketing and financing activities. Disruptions to the capital markets could include, but are not limited to: recession or an economic slowdown; the bankruptcy of one or more energy companies; 104 significant increases in the prices for oil or other fuel; a terrorist attack or threatened attacks; or a significant transmission failure. In accordance with the requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and the SEC rules thereunder, PHIs management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and is required to assess annually the effectiveness of these controls. The inability to certify the effectiveness of these controls due to the identification of one or more material weaknesses in these controls also could increase the financing costs of PHI and its subsidiaries or could adversely affect their ability to access one or more financial markets. PHIs future defined benefit plan funding obligations are affected by its assumptions regarding the valuation of its benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets; actual experience which varies from the assumptions could result in an obligation of PHI to make significant unplanned cash contributions to the plan. PHI follows the guidance of SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," in accounting for pension benefits under the Retirement Plan, a non contributory defined benefit plan. In accordance with these accounting standards, PHI makes assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. Changes in assumptions, such as the use of a different discount rate or expected return on plan assets, affect the calculation of projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit obligation (ABO), reported pension liability on PHIs balance sheet, and reported annual net periodic pension benefit cost on PHIs statement of earnings. Furthermore, if actual pension plan experience is different from that which is expected, the ABO could be greater than the fair value of pension plan assets. If this were to occur, PHI could be required to recognize an additional minimum liability as prescribed by SFAS No. 87. The liability would be recorded as a reduction to common equity through a charge to Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), and would not affect net income for the year. The charge to OCI would be restored through common equity in future periods when the fair value of plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation. PHIs funding policy is to make cash contributions to the pension plan sufficient for plan assets to exceed the ABO, and avoid the recognition of an additional minimum liability. Use of alternative assumptions could also impact the expected future cash funding requirements for the pension plan if PHIs defined benefit plan did not meet the minimum funding requirements of ERISA. PHIs cash flow, ability to pay dividends and ability to satisfy debt obligations depend on the performance of its operating subsidiaries. PHIs unsecured obligations are effectively subordinated to the liabilities and the outstanding preferred stock of its subsidiaries. PHI is a holding company that conducts its operations entirely through its subsidiaries, and all of PHIs consolidated operating assets are held by its subsidiaries. Accordingly, PHIs cash flow, its ability to satisfy its obligations to creditors and its ability to pay dividends on its common stock are dependent upon the earnings of the subsidiaries and the distribution of such earnings to PHI in the form of dividends. The subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts due on any debt or equity securities issued by PHI or 105 to make any funds available for such payment. Because the claims of the creditors and preferred stockholders of PHIs subsidiaries are superior to PHIs entitlement to dividends, the unsecured debt and obligations of PHI are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of its subsidiaries and to the rights of the holders of preferred stock to receive dividend payments. Energy companies are subject to adverse publicity, which may render PHI and its subsidiaries vulnerable to negative regulatory and litigation outcomes. The energy sector has been among the sectors of the economy that have been the subject of highly publicized allegations of misconduct in recent years. In addition, many utility companies have been publicly criticized for their performance during recent natural disasters and weather related incidents. Adverse publicity of this nature may render legislatures, regulatory authorities, and other government officials less likely to view energy companies such as PHI and its subsidiaries in a favorable light, and may cause PHI and its subsidiaries to be susceptible to adverse outcomes with respect to decisions by such bodies. Provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and PHIs organizational documents may discourage an acquisition of PHI. The Delaware General Corporation Law and PHIs organizational documents both contain provisions that could impede the removal of PHIs directors and discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire PHI. As a Delaware corporation, PHI is subject to the business combination law set forth in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could have the effect of delaying, discouraging or preventing an acquisition of PHI. PHI has a staggered board of directors that is divided into three classes of equal size, with one class elected each year for a term of three years. At the 2005 Annual Meeting, the shareholders approved an amendment to PHIs Certificate of Incorporation that will eliminate the staggered board over a two year period. As a result, beginning with the 2007 Annual Meeting, all of the directors will be elected for one year terms.

The restatement includes the correction of other errors for the same periods, primarily relating to unbilled revenue, taxes, and various accrual accounts, which were considered by management to be immaterial. These other errors would not themselves have required a restatement absent the restatement to correct the accounting for deferred compensation arrangements. This restatement was required solely because the cumulative impact of the correction, if recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005, would have been material to that periods reported net income. See Note 13 "Restatement" for further discussion. GENERAL OVERVIEW Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco) is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity in Washington, D.C. and major portions of Montgomery County and Prince Georges County in suburban Maryland. Pepco provides Default Electricity Supply, which is the supply of electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its territories who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive supplier, in both the District of Columbia and Maryland. Default Electricity Supply is known as Standard Offer Service (SOS) in both the District of Columbia and Maryland. Pepcos service territory covers approximately 640 square miles and has a population of approximately 2 million. As of December 31, 2005, approximately 57% of delivered electricity sales were to Maryland customers and approximately 43% were to Washington, D.C. customers. Pepco is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI or Pepco Holdings). Because PHI is a public utility holding company subject to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005), the relationship between PHI and Pepco and certain activities of Pepco are subject to the regulatory oversight of FERC under PUHCA 2005. 109 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The accompanying results of operations discussion is for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Other than this disclosure, information under this item has been omitted in accordance with General Instruction I(2)(a) to the Form 10 K. All amounts in the tables (except sales and customers) are in millions. Operating Revenue 2005 2004 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 880.6 $ 845.4 $ 35.2 Default Supply Revenue 929.8 924.5 5.3 Other Electric Revenue 34.9 36.0 (1.1 ) Total Operating Revenue $ 1,845.3 $ 1,805.9 $ 39.4 The table above shows the amount of Operating Revenue earned that is subject to price regulation (Regulated T&D (Transmission and Distribution) Electric Revenue and Default Supply Revenue) and that which is not subject to price regulation (Other Electric Revenue). Regulated T&D Electric Revenue consists of the revenue Pepco receives for delivery of electricity to its customers for which service Pepco is paid regulated rates. Default Supply Revenue is the revenue received from Default Electricity Supply. The costs related to the supply of electricity are included in Fuel and Purchased Energy expense. Other Electric Revenue includes work and services performed on behalf of customers including other utilities, which is not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rents, late payments, and collection fees. Regulated T&D Electric Regulated T&D Electric Revenue 2005 2004 Change Residential $ 253.4 $ 248.8 $ 4.6 Commercial 513.9 480.9 33.0 Industrial Other (Includes PJM) 113.3 115.7 (2.4 ) Total Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 880.6 $ 845.4 $ 35.2 Regulated T&D Electric Sales (Gwh) 2005 2004 Change Residential 8,024 8,135 (111 ) Commercial 19,407 18,601 806 Industrial Other 163 166 (3 ) Total Regulated T&D Electric Sales 27,594 26,902 692 110 Regulated T&D Electric Customers (000s) 2005 2004 Change Residential 674 665 9 Commercial 73 72 1 Industrial Other Total Regulated T&D Electric Customers 747 737 10 Regulated T&D Electric Revenue increased by $35.2 million primarily due to the following: (i) $21.7 million increase in tax pass throughs, offset in Other Taxes, (ii) $10.2 million due to customer growth, the result of a 1.4% customer increase in 2005, (iii) $7.1 million increase in estimated unbilled revenue recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005, primarily reflecting a modification in the estimation process (includes $3.3 million in tax pass throughs), and (iv) $6.8 million increase due to weather, the result of a 10% increase in Cooling Degree Days in 2005, offset by $10.6 million due to other sales and rate variances.

Default Supply Revenue is partially offset in Fuel and Purchased Power expense. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, Pepcos Maryland customers served by an alternate supplier represented 38% of Pepcos total Maryland sales, and Pepcos District of Columbia customers served by an alternate supplier represented 58% of Pepcos total District of Columbia sales. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, Pepcos Maryland customers served by an alternate supplier represented 29% of Pepcos total Maryland sales, and Pepcos District of Columbia customers served by an alternate supplier represented 32% of Pepcos total District of Columbia sales. Operating Expenses Fuel and Purchased Energy Fuel and Purchased Energy increased by $15.5 million to $913.7 million in 2005, from $898.2 million in 2004. The increase is primarily due to: (i) $209.3 million increase in higher average energy costs, the result of new SOS supply contracts in 2005 and (ii) $33.1 million increase due to customer growth and (iii) $3.9 million increase in other sales and rate variances, partially offset by (iv) $230.8 million decrease due to higher commercial customer migration. This expense is primarily offset in Default Supply Revenue. Other Operation and Maintenance Other Operation and Maintenance expenses increased by $7.1 million to $280.3 million in 2005, from $273.2 million in 2004. The increase was primarily due to the following: (i) $8.9 million increase in employee related costs, (ii) $3.9 million due to the write off of software and (iii) $2.0 million in emergency restoration and maintenance expenses, partially offset by (iv) $5.5 million decrease in PJM administrative expenses due to market based SOS in 2005 and (v) $4.9 million reduction in the uncollectible account reserve to reflect the amount expected to be collected on Pepcos Pre Petition Claims with Mirant. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and Amortization expenses decreased by $4.5 million to $161.8 million in 2005, from $166.3 million in 2004. The decrease is primarily due to $5.7 million lower amortization of non regulated assets that have been fully amortized. Other Taxes Other Taxes increased by $27.1 million to $276.1 million in 2005, from $249.0 million in 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher pass throughs, mainly as the result of a county surcharge rate increase (partially offset in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue). 112 Gain on Settlement of Claims with Mirant The Gain on Settlement of Claims with Mirant of $70.5 million represents a settlement (net of customer sharing) with Mirant in the fourth quarter of 2005 related to the TPA between Pepco and Mirant ($70 million gain) and a Pepco asbestos claim against the Mirant bankruptcy estate ($.5 million gain). Gain on Sales of Assets Gain on Sales of Assets increased $65.5 million to $72.4 million in 2005, from $6.9 million in 2004. This increase is primarily due to a $68.1 million gain from the sale of non utility land located at Buzzard Point in the third quarter of 2005. Other Income (Expenses) Other Expenses decreased by $10.2 million to a net expense of $63.7 million in 2005, from a net expense of $73.9 million in 2004. This decrease was primarily due to: (i) $3.9 million increase in interest and dividend income, (ii) $2.8 million increase in other income due to higher gross up percentages applied to contributions in aid of construction (offset in Income Tax expense) and (iii) $2.2 million gain from the sale of stock in 2005. Income Tax Expense Pepcos effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 44% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference were state income taxes (net of federal benefit), the flow through of certain book tax depreciation differences, and changes in estimates related to tax liabilities of prior tax years subject to audit (which, in addition to the mixed service cost issued under IRS Ruling 2005 53, were the reasons for the higher effective tax rate as compared to 2004), partially offset by the flow through of tax credits. Pepcos effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2004 was 37% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference were state income taxes (net of federal benefit) and the flow through of certain book tax depreciation differences, partially offset by the flow through of tax credits and changes in estimates related to tax liabilities of prior tax years subject to audit (which was the primary reason for the lower effective tax rate as compared to 2003). RISK FACTORS The business of Pepco is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the events or conditions identified below. The occurrence of one or more of these events or conditions could have an adverse effect on the business of Pepco, including, depending on the circumstances, their results of operations and financial condition. 113 Pepco is a public utility that is subject to substantial governmental regulation. If Pepco receives unfavorable regulatory treatment, Pepcos business could be negatively affected. Pepcos utility business is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local regulatory agencies that significantly affects its operations. Pepcos operations are regulated in Maryland by the MPSC and in Washington, D.C. by the DCPSC with respect to, among other things, the rates it can charge retail customers for the supply and distribution of electricity. In addition, the rates that Pepco can charge for electricity transmission are regulated by FERC. Pepco cannot change supply, distribution or transmission rates without approval by the applicable regulatory authority. While the approved distribution and transmission rates are intended to permit Pepco to recover its costs of service and earn a reasonable rate of return, Pepcos profitability is affected by the rates it is able to charge. In addition, if the costs incurred by Pepco in operating its transmission and distribution facilities exceed the allowed amounts for costs included in the approved rates , Pepcos financial results will be adversely affected. Pepco also is required to have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from governmental agencies that regulate its business. Pepco believes that it has obtained or sought renewal of the material permits, approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations and that its business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, Pepco is unable to predict the impact of future regulatory activities of any of these agencies on its business. Changes in or reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations, or the imposition of new laws or regulations, may require Pepco to incur additional expenses or to change the way it conducts its operations. Pepcos business could be adversely affected by the Mirant bankruptcy. In 2000, Pepco sold substantially all of its electricity generation assets to Mirant. As part of the sale, Pepco entered into several ongoing contractual arrangements with Mirant and certain of its subsidiaries. On July 14, 2003, Mirant and most of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas. Depending on the outcome of the proceedings related to bankruptcy, the Mirant bankruptcy could adversely affect Pepcos business. See "Relationship with Mirant Corporation" for additional information. Pepco may be required to make additional divestiture proceeds gain sharing payments to customers in the District of Columbia and Maryland. Pepco currently is involved in regulatory proceedings in Maryland and the District of Columbia related to the sharing of the net proceeds from the sale of its generation related assets. The principal issue in the proceedings is whether Pepco should be required to share with customers the excess deferred income taxes and accumulated deferred investment tax credits associated with the sold assets and, if so, whether such sharing would violate the normalization provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and its implementing regulations. Depending on the outcome of the proceedings, Pepco could be required to make additional gain sharing payments to customers and payments to the IRS in the amount of the associated accumulated deferred investment tax credits, and Pepco might be unable to use accelerated depreciation on District of Columbia and Maryland allocated or assigned property. See Item 7 "Regulatory and Other Matters" for additional information. 114 The operating results of Pepco fluctuate on a seasonal basis and can be adversely affected by changes in weather. Pepcos electric utility business is seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on its operating performance. Demand for electricity is generally greater in the summer months associated with cooling and in the winter months associated with heating as compared to other times of the year. Accordingly, Pepco historically has generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer. Pepcos facilities may not operate as planned or may require significant maintenance expenditures, which could decrease its revenues or increase its expenses. Operation of transmission and distribution facilities involves many risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment, accidents, labor disputes and performance below expected levels. Older facilities and equipment, even if maintained in accordance with sound engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures for additions or upgrades to keep them operating at peak efficiency, to comply with changing environmental requirements, or to provide reliable operations. Natural disasters and weather related incidents, including tornadoes, hurricanes and snow and ice storms, also can disrupt transmission and distribution delivery systems. Operation of transmission and distribution facilities below expected capacity levels can reduce revenues and result in the incurrence of additional expenses that may not be recoverable from customers or through insurance. Furthermore, if Pepco is unable to perform its contractual obligations for any of these reasons, it may incur penalties or damages. Pepcos transmission facilities are interconnected with the facilities of other transmission facility owners whose actions could have a negative impact on Pepcos operations. The transmission facilities of Pepco are directly interconnected with the transmission facilities of contiguous utilities and as such are part of an interstate power transmission grid. FERC has designated a number of regional transmission operators to coordinate the operation of portions of the interstate transmission grid. Pepco is a member of PJM, which is the regional transmission operator that coordinates the movement of electricity in all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Pepco operates its transmission facilities under the direction and control of PJM. PJM and the other regional transmission operators have established sophisticated systems that are designed to ensure the reliability of the operation of transmission facilities and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impact on the operatio ns of the other utilities. However, the systems put in place by PJM and the other regional transmission operators may not always be adequate to prevent problems at other utilities from causing service interruptions in the transmission facilities of Pepco. If Pepco were to suffer such a service interruption, it could have a negative impact on its business. The cost of compliance with environmental laws is significant and new environmental laws may increase Pepcos expenses. Pepcos operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, spill prevention waste management, natural resources, site remediation, and health and safety. These laws and regulations require 115 Pepco to make capital expenditures and to incur other expenditures to, among other things, conduct site remediation and perform environmental monitoring. Pepco also may be required to pay significant remediation costs with respect to third party sites. If Pepco fails to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond its control, such failure could result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities and the need to expend significant sums to come into compliance. In addition, Pepco incurs costs to obtain and comply with a variety of environmental permits, licenses, inspections and other approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval, or if Pepco fails to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, operations at affected facilities could be halted or subjected to additional costs. New environmental laws and regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, could impose more stringent limitations on Pepcos operations or require it to incur significant additional costs. Pepcos current compliance strategy may not successfully address the relevant standards and interpretations of the future. Changes in technology may adversely affect Pepcos business. Increased conservation efforts and advances in technology could reduce demand for electricity supply and distribution, which could adversely affect Pepcos business. In addition, changes in technology also could alter the channels through which retail electric customers buy electricity, which could adversely affect Pepcos business. Acts of terrorism could adversely affect Pepcos business. The threat of, or actual acts of, terrorism may affect Pepcos operations in unpredictable ways and may cause changes in the insurance markets, force Pepco to increase security measures and cause disruptions of power markets. If any of Pepcos transmission or distribution facilities were to be a direct target, or an indirect casualty, of an act of terrorism, its operations could be adversely affected. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism also could affect the ability of Pepco to raise needed capital. Pepcos insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all casualty losses that it might incur. Pepco currently has insurance coverage for its facilities and operations in amounts and with deductibles that it considers appropriate. However, there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, some risks, such as weather related casualties, may not be insurable. In the case of loss or damage to property, plant or equipment, there is no assurance that the insurance proceeds, if any, received will be sufficient to cover the entire cost of replacement or repair. Pepco may be adversely affected by economic conditions. Periods of slowed economic activity generally result in decreased demand for power, particularly by industrial and large commercial customers. As a consequence, recessions or other downturns in the economy may result in decreased revenues and cash flows for Pepco. 116 Pepco is dependent on its ability to successfully access capital markets. An inability to access capital may adversely affect its business. Pepco relies on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity and to satisfy its capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from its operations. Capital market disruptions, or a downgrade in Pepcos credit ratings, could increase the cost of borrowing or could adversely affect its ability to access one or more financial markets. Disruptions to the capital markets could include, but are not limited to: recession or an economic slowdown; the bankruptcy of one or more energy companies; significant increases in the prices for oil or other fuel; a terrorist attack or threatened attacks; or a significant transmission failure. In accordance with the requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, and the SEC rules thereunder, Pepcos management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and is required to assess annually the effectiveness of these controls. The inability to certify the effectiveness of these controls due to the identification of one or more material weaknesses in these controls also could increase the financing costs of PHI and its subsidiaries or could adversely affect their ability to access one or more financial markets. Pepcos future defined benefit plan funding obligations are affected by its assumptions regarding the valuation of its benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets; actual experience which varies from the assumptions could result in an obligation of Pepco to make significant unplanned cash contributions to the plan. Pepco follows the guidance of SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" in accounting for pension benefits under the Retirement Plan, a non contributory defined benefit plan. In accordance with these accounting standards, Pepco makes assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. Changes in assumptions such as the use of a different discount rate or expected return on plan assets, affect the calculation of projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit obligations (ABO), reported pension liability on Pepcos balance sheet, and reported annual net periodic pension benefit cost on Pepcos statement of earnings. Furthermore, if actual pension plan experience is different from that which is expected, the ABO could be greater than the fair value of pension plan assets. If this were to occur, Pepco could be required to recognize an additional minimum liability as prescribed by SFAS No. 87. The liability would be recorded as a reduction to common equity through a charge to Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), and would not affect net income for the year. The charge to OCI would be restored through common equity in future periods when the fair value of plan assets exceeded the ABO. Pepcos funding policy is to make cash contributions to the pension plan sufficient for plan assets to exceed the ABO, and avoid the recognition of an additional minimum liability. 117 Use of alternative assumptions could also impact the expected future cash funding requirements for the pension plan if Pepcos defined benefit plan did not meet the minimum funding requirements of ERISA. Energy companies are subject to adverse publicity, which may render Pepco vulnerable to negative regulatory and litigation outcomes. The energy sector has been among the sectors of the economy that have been the subject of highly publicized allegations of misconduct in recent years. In addition, many utility companies have been publicly criticized for their performance during recent natural disasters and weather related incidents. Adverse publicity of this nature may render legislatures, regulatory authorities, and other government officials less likely to view energy companies such as Pepco in a favorable light and may cause Pepco to be susceptible to adverse outcomes with respect to decisions by such bodies. Because Pepco is a wholly owned subsidiary of PHI, PHI can exercise substantial control over its dividend policy and business and operations. All of the members of Pepcos board of directors, as well as many of Pepcos executive officers, are officers of PHI. Among other decisions, Pepcos board is responsible for decisions regarding payment of dividends, financing and capital raising activities, and acquisition and disposition of assets. Within the limitations of applicable law, and subject to the financial covenants under Pepcos outstanding debt instruments, Pepcos board of directors will base its decisions concerning the amount and timing of dividends, and other business decisions, on Pepcos earnings, cash flow and capital structure, but may also take into account the business plans and financial requirements of PHI and its other subsidiaries.

The restatement includes the correction of other errors for the same periods, primarily relating to unbilled revenue, taxes, and various accrual accounts, which were considered by management to be immaterial. These other errors would not themselves have required a restatement absent the restatement to correct the accounting for deferred compensation arrangements. The restatement of Pepco Holdings consolidated financial statements was required solely because the cumulative impact of the correction, if recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005, would have been material to that periods reported net income. The restatem ent to correct the accounting for the deferred compensation arrangements had no impact on DPL; however, DPL restated its previously reported financial statements as of December 31, 2004 and for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the quarterly financial information for the first three quarters in 2005, and all quarterly periods in 2004, to reflect the correction of other errors. The correction of these other errors, primarily relating to unbilled revenue, taxes, and various accrual accounts, was considered by management to be immaterial. See Note 13 "Restatement" for further discussion. GENERAL OVERVIEW Delmarva Power & Light Company (DPL) is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity in Delaware and portions of Maryland and Virginia. DPL provides Default Electricity Supply, which is the supply of electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its territories who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive supplier. Default Electricity Supply is also known as Default Service in Virginia, as Standard Offer Service (SOS) in Maryland and in Delaware on and after May 1, 2006, and as Provider of Last Resort service in Delaware before May 1, 2006. DPLs electricity distribution service territory covers approximately 6,000 square miles and has a population of approximately 1.28 million. As of December 31, 2005, approximately 65% of delivered electricity sales were to Delaware customers, approximately 31% were to Maryland customers, and approximately 4% were to Virginia customers. DPL also provides natural gas distribution servi ce in northern Delaware. DPLs natural gas distribution service territory covers approximately 275 square miles and has a population of approximately 523,000. DPL is a wholly owned subsidiary of Conectiv, which is wholly owned by Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI). Because PHI is a public utility holding company subject to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005), the relationship between PHI and DPL and certain activities of DPL are subject to the regulatory oversight of FERC under PUHCA 2005. 122 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The accompanying results of operations discussion is for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Other than this disclosure, information under this item has been omitted in accordance with General Instruction I(2)(a) to the Form 10 K. All amounts in the tables (except sales and customers) are in millions. Electric Operating Revenue 2005 2004 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 382.6 $ 369.6 $ 13.0 Default Supply Revenue 676.2 628.2 48.0 Other Electric Revenue 23.5 19.6 3.9 Total Electric Operating Revenue $ 1,082.3 $ 1,017.4 $ 64.9 The table above shows the amount of Electric Operating Revenue earned that is subject to price regulation (Regulated T&D (Transmission and Distribution) Electric Revenue and Default Supply Revenue) and that which is not subject to price regulation (Other Electric Revenue). Regulated T&D Electric Revenue includes revenue DPL receives for delivery of electricity to its customers, for which DPL is paid regulated rates. Default Supply Revenue is the revenue received from Default Electricity Supply. The costs related to the supply of electricity are included in Fuel and Purchased Energy expense. Other Electric Revenue includes work and services performed on behalf of customers including other utilities, which is not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rents, late payments, and collection fees. Regulated T&D Electric Regulated T&D Electric Revenue 2005 2004 Change Residential $ 183.7 $ 178.5 $ 5.2 Commercial 104.4 100.5 3.9 Industrial 20.7 20.1 .6 Other (Includes PJM) 73.8 70.5 3.3 Total Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 382.6 $ 369.6 $ 13.0 Regulated T&D Electric Sales (Gwh) 2005 2004 Change Residential 5,578 5,349 229 Commercial 5,410 5,244 166 Industrial 3,063 3,258 (195 ) Other 50 51 (1 ) Total Regulated T&D Electric Sales 14,101 13,902 199 123 Regulated T&D Electric Customers (000s) 2005 2004 Change Residential 449 441 8 Commercial 59 58 1 Industrial 1 1 Other 1 1 Total Regulated T&D Electric Customers 510 501 9 Regulated T&D Electric Revenue increased by $13.0 million due primarily to: (i) $5.4 million increase due to other sales and rate variances, (ii) $4.8 million due to customer growth, the result of a 1.8% customer increase in 2005, and (iii) $4.0 million increase due to weather, primarily the result of a 16.7% increase in Cooling Degree Days in 2005, offset by (iv) $1.2 million reduction in estimated unbilled revenue recorded in the second quarter of 2005, primarily reflecting higher estimated power line losses (estimates of electricity expected to be lost in the process of its transmission and distribution to customers). Default Electricity Supply Default Supply Revenue 2005 2004 Change Residential $ 323.8 $ 279.6 $ 44.2 Commercial 261.2 254.0 7.2 Industrial 88.0 91.7 (3.7 ) Other (Includes PJM) 3.2 2.9 .3 Total Default Supply Revenue $ 676.2 $ 628.2 $ 48.0 Default Electricity Supply Sales (Gwh) 2005 2004 Change Residential 5,589 5,340 249 Commercial 4,822 4,715 107 Industrial 1,720 1,906 (186 ) Other 51 48 3 Total Default Electricity Supply Sales 12,182 12,009 173 Default Electricity Supply Customers (000s) 2005 2004 Change Residential 449 441 8 Commercial 58 56 2 Industrial 1 1 Other 1 1 Total Default Electricity Supply Customers 509 499 10 124 Default Supply Revenue increased $48.0 million due primarily to the following: (i) $39.3 million higher retail energy rates, primarily resulting from new market based Maryland SOS effective June 2005, (ii) $14.5 million increase due to customer growth, (iii) $13.4 million increase due to favorable weather, offset by (iv) $9.0 million decrease due to customer migration, (v) $7.4 million decrease due to other sales and rate variances, and (vi) $2.8 million reduction in estimated unbilled revenue primarily reflecting higher estimated power line losses recorded in the second quarter of 2005. Default Supply Revenue is partially offset in Fuel and Purchased Power expense. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, DPLs Delaware customers served by an alternate supplier represented 10% of DPLs total Delaware sales and DPLs Maryland customers served by an alternate supplier represented 23% of DPLs total Maryland sales. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, DPLs Delaware customers served by an alternate supplier represented 11% of DPLs total Delaware sales and DPLs Maryland customers served by an alternate supplier represented 19% of DPLs total Maryland sales. Other Electric Revenue Other Electric Revenue increased by $3.9 million to $23.5 million in 2005 from $19.6 million in 2004 primarily due to mutual assistance work related to storm damage in 2005 (primarily offset in Other Operation and Maintenance expense). Natural Gas Operating Revenue 2005 2004 Change Regulated Gas Revenue $ 198.7 $ 169.7 $ 29.0 Other Gas Revenue 62.8 58.9 3.9 Total Natural Gas Operating Revenue $ 261.5 $ 228.6 $ 32.9 The table above shows the amounts of Natural Gas Operating Revenue from sources that are subject to price regulation (Regulated Gas Revenue) and those that generally are not subject to price regulation (Other Gas Revenue). Regulated Gas Revenue includes the revenue DPL receives for on system natural gas delivered sales and the transportation of natural gas for customers. Other Gas Revenue includes off system natural gas sales and the release of excess system capacity. Regulated Gas Regulated Gas Revenue 2005 2004 Change Residential $ 115.0 $ 100.2 $ 14.8 Commercial 68.5 56.7 11.8 Industrial 10.6 8.3 2.3 Transportation and Other 4.6 4.5 .1 Total Regulated Gas Revenue $ 198.7 $ 169.7 $ 29.0 125 Regulated Gas Sales (Bcf) 2005 2004 Change Residential 8.4 8.7 (.3 ) Commercial 5.6 5.5 .1 Industrial 1.1 1.2 (.1 ) Transportation and Other 5.6 6.2 (.6 ) Total Regulated Gas Sales 20.7 21.6 (.9 ) Regulated Gas Customers (000s) 2005 2004 Change Residential 111 109 2 Commercial 9 9 Industrial Transportation and Other Total Regulated Gas Customers 120 118 2 Regulated Gas Revenue increased by $29.0 million primarily due to a $30.6 million increase in the Gas Cost Rate (GCR) effective November 2004 and 2005, due to higher natural gas commodity costs (primarily offset in Gas Purchased expense). Other Gas Revenue Other Gas Revenue increased by $3.9 to $62.8 million in 2005 from $58.9 million in 2004 primarily due to increased capacity release revenues. Operating Expenses Fuel and Purchased Energy Fuel and Purchased Energy increased by $42.4 million to $698.0 million in 2005 from $655.6 million in 2004. The increase is primarily due to: (i) $33.0 million increase in higher average energy costs, the result of new Maryland SOS supply contracts in June 2005 and (ii) $10.9 million increase due to customer growth and (iii) $6.6 million increase in other sales and rate variances, partially offset by (iv) $8.1 million decrease due to higher customer migration. This expense is primarily offset in Default Supply Revenue. Gas Purchased Total Gas Purchased increased by $33.1 million to $196.8 million in 2005 from $163.7 million in 2004. This increase was primarily due to: (i) $30.3 million increase due to higher wholesale commodity costs partially offset by storage injections, (ii) $10.0 million increase in deferred fuel costs, partially offset by (iii) $7.2 million decrease from the settlement of financial hedges (entered into as part of DPLs regulated natural gas hedge program). This expense is primarily offset in Regulated Gas Revenues. 126 Other Operation and Maintenance Other Operation and Maintenance expenses increased by $3.1 million to $180.1 million in 2005 from $177.0 million in 2004. This increase was primarily due to a $3.5 million increase for mutual assistance work related to 2005 storm damage (primarily offset in Other Electric Revenues). Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and Amortization expenses increased by $1.8 million to $75.7 million in 2005 from $73.9 million in 2004, primarily due to utility property additions. Gain on Sale of Assets Gain on Sale of Assets represents a $3.6 million gain on sale of land in 2005. Income Tax Expense DPLs effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 43% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference were state income taxes (net of federal benefit), changes in estimates related to tax liabilities of prior tax years subject to audit (primarily due to the mixed service cost issue under IRS Rule 2005 53), and the flow through of certain book tax depreciation differences partially offset by the flow through of deferred investment tax credits. DPLs effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2004 was 43% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference were state income taxes (net of federal benefit), changes in estimates related to tax liabilities of prior tax years subject to audit, and the flow through of certain book tax depreciation differences partially offset by the flow through of deferred investment tax credits. RISK FACTORS The business of DPL is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the events or conditions identified below. The occurrence of one or more of these events or conditions could have an adverse effect on the business of DPL, including, depending on the circumstances, its results of operations and financial condition. DPL is a public utility that is subject to substantial governmental regulation. If DPL receives unfavorable regulatory treatment, DPLs business could be negatively affected. DPLs utility business is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local regulatory agencies that significantly affects its operations. DPLs operations are regulated in Maryland by the MPSC, in Delaware by the DPSC and in Virginia by the VSCC with respect to, among other things, the rates it can charge retail customers for the supply and distribution of electricity and gas. In addition, the rates that DPL can charge for electricity transmission are regulated by FERC. DPL cannot change supply, distribution or transmission rates without approval by the applicable regulatory authority. While the approved distribution and transmission rates are intended to permit DPL to recover its costs of service and earn a reasonable rate of return, DPLs profitability is affected by the rates it is able to charge. In addition, if the costs incurred by DPL in operating its transmission and distribution facilities exceed the allowed amounts for costs 127 included in the approved rates, DPLs financial results will be adversely affected. DPL also is required to have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from governmental agencies that regulate its business. DPL believes that it has obtained or sought renewal of the material permits, approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations and that its business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, DPL is unable to predict the impact of future regulatory activities of any of these agencies on its business. Changes in or reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations, or the imposition of new laws or regulations, may require DPL to incur additional expenses or to change the way it conducts its operations. The operating results of DPL fluctuate on a seasonal basis and can be adversely affected by changes in weather. DPLs utility businesses are seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on its operating performance. Demand for electricity is generally greater in the summer months associated with cooling and demand for electricity and gas is generally greater in the winter months associated with heating as compared to other times of the year. Accordingly, DPL historically has generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer. DPLs facilities may not operate as planned or may require significant maintenance expenditures, which could decrease its revenues or increase its expenses. Operation of transmission and distribution facilities involves many risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment, accidents, labor disputes and performance below expected levels. Older facilities and equipment, even if maintained in accordance with sound engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures for additions or upgrades to keep them operating at peak efficiency, to comply with changing environmental requirements, or to provide reliable operations. Natural disasters and weather related incidents, including tornadoes, hurricanes and snow and ice storms, also can disrupt transmission and distribution delivery systems. Operation of transmission and distribution facilities below expected capacity levels can reduce revenues and result in the incurrence of additional expenses that may not be recoverable from customers or through insurance. Furthermore, if DPL is unable to perform its contractual obligations for any of these reasons, it may in cur penalties or damages. DPLs transmission facilities are interconnected with the facilities of other transmission facility owners whose actions could have a negative impact on DPLs operations. The electricity transmission facilities of DPL are directly interconnected with the transmission facilities of contiguous utilities and as such are part of an interstate power transmission grid. FERC has designated a number of regional transmission operators to coordinate the operation of portions of the interstate transmission grid. DPL is a member of PJM, which is the regional transmission operator that coordinates the movement of electricity in all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. DPL operates its transmission facilities under the direction and control of PJM. PJM and the other regional transmission operators have established sophisticated systems that are designed to ensure the reliability of the operation of transmission facilities and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impact on the operation s of the other utilities. However, the systems put in place by PJM and the other regional transmission operators may not always be 128 adequate to prevent problems at other utilities from causing service interruptions in the transmission facilities of DPL. If DPL were to suffer such a service interruption, it could have a negative impact on its business. The cost of compliance with environmental laws is significant and new environmental laws may increase DPLs expenses. DPLs operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, spill prevention, waste management, natural resources, site remediation, and health and safety. These laws and regulations require DPL to make capital expenditures and to incur other expenditures to, among other things, conduct site remediation and perform environmental monitoring. DPL also may be required to pay significant remediation costs with respect to third party sites. If DPL fails to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond its control, such failure could result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities and the need to expend significant sums to come into compliance. In addition, DPL incurs costs to obtain and comply with a variety of environmental permits, licenses, inspections and other approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval, or if DPL fails to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, operations at affected facilities could be halted or subjected to additional costs. New environmental laws and regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, could impose more stringent limitations on DPLs operations or require it to incur significant additional costs. DPLs current compliance strategy may not successfully address the relevant standards and interpretations of the future. Changes in technology may adversely affect DPLs electricity and gas delivery businesses. Increased conservation efforts and advances in technology could reduce demand for electricity and gas supply and distribution, which could adversely affect DPLs business. In addition, changes in technology also could alter the channels through which retail electric customers buy electricity, which could adversely affect DPLs business. Acts of terrorism could adversely affect DPLs business. The threat of or actual acts of terrorism may affect DPLs operations in unpredictable ways and may cause changes in the insurance markets, force DPL to increase security measures and cause disruptions of power markets. If any of DPLs fuel storage, transmission or distribution facilities were to be a direct target, or an indirect casualty, of an act of terrorism, its operations could be adversely affected. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism also could affect the ability of DPL to raise needed capital. 129 DPLs insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all casualty losses that it might incur. DPL currently has insurance coverage for its facilities and operations in amounts and with deductibles that it considers appropriate. However, there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, some risks, such as weather related casualties, may not be insurable. In the case of loss or damage to property, plant or equipment, there is no assurance that the insurance proceeds, if any, received will be sufficient to cover the entire cost of replacement or repair. DPL may be adversely affected by economic conditions. Periods of slowed economic activity generally result in decreased demand for power, particularly by industrial and large commercial customers. As a consequence, recessions or other downturns in the economy may result in decreased revenues and cash flows for DPL. DPL is dependent on its ability to successfully access capital markets. An inability to access capital may adversely affect its business. DPL relies on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity and to satisfy its capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from its operations. Capital market disruptions, or a downgrade in DPLs credit ratings, would increase the cost of borrowing or could adversely affect its ability to access one or more financial markets. Disruptions to the capital markets could include, but are not limited to: recession or an economic slowdown; the bankruptcy of one or more energy companies; significant increases in the prices for oil or other fuel; a terrorist attack or threatened attacks; or a significant transmission failure. 130 In accordance with the requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, and the SEC rules thereunder, DPLs management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and is required to assess annually the effectiveness of these controls. The inability to certify the effectiveness of these controls due to the identification of one or more material weaknesses in these controls also could increase the financing costs of PHI and its subsidiaries or could adversely affect their ability to access one or more financial markets. DPLs future defined benefit plan funding obligations are affected by its assumptions regarding the valuation of its benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets; actual experience which varies from the assumptions could result in an obligation of DPL to make significant unplanned cash contributions to the plan. DPL follows the guidance of SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" in accounting for pension benefits under the Retirement Plan, a non contributory defined benefit plan. In accordance with these accounting standards, DPL makes assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. Changes in assumptions such as the use of a different discount rate or expected return on plan assets, affect the calculation of projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit obligations (ABO), reported pension liability on DPLs balance sheet, and reported annual net periodic pension benefit cost on DPLs statement of earnings. Furthermore, if actual pension plan experience is different from that which is expected, the ABO could be greater than the fair value of pension plan assets. If this were to occur, DPL could be required to recognize an additional minimum liability as prescribed by SFAS No. 87. The liability would be recorded as a reduction to common equity through a charge to Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), and would not affect net income for the year. The charge to OCI would be restored through common equity in future periods when the fair value of plan assets exceeded the ABO. DPLs funding policy is to make cash contributions to the pension plan sufficient for plan assets to exceed the ABO, and avoid the recognition of an additional minimum liability. Use of alternative assumptions could also impact the expected future cash funding requirements for the pension plan if DPLs defined benefit plan did not meet the minimum funding requirements of ERISA. Energy companies are subject to adverse publicity, which may render DPL vulnerable to negative regulatory and litigation outcomes. The energy sector has been among the sectors of the economy that have been the subject of highly publicized allegations of misconduct in recent years. In addition, many utility companies have been publicly criticized for their performance during recent natural disasters and weather related incidents. Adverse publicity of this nature may render legislatures, regulatory authorities, and tribunals less likely to view energy companies such as DPL in a favorable light and may cause DPL to be susceptible to adverse outcomes with respect to decisions by such bodies. 131 Because DPL is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of PHI, PHI can exercise substantial control over its dividend policy and business and operations.

The restatement includes the correction of other errors for the same periods, primarily relating to unbilled revenue, taxes, and various accrual accounts, which were considered by management to be immaterial. These other errors would not themselves have required a restatement absent the restatement to correct the accounting for deferred compensation arrangements. The restatement of Pepco Holdings consolidated financial statements was required solely because the cumulative impact of the correction, if recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005, would have been material to that periods reported net income. The re statement to correct the accounting for the deferred compensation arrangements had no impact on ACE; however, ACE restated its previously reported consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2004 and for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the quarterly financial information for the first three quarters in 2005, and all quarterly periods in 2004, to reflect the correction of other errors. The correction of these other errors, primarily relating to taxes and various accrual accounts, was considered by management to be immaterial. See Note 14 "Restatement" for further discussion. GENERAL OVERVIEW Atlantic City Electric Company (ACE) is engaged in the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity in southern New Jersey. ACE provides Default Electricity Supply, which is the supply of electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territory who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive supplier. Default Electricity Supply is also known as Basic Generation Service (BGS) in New Jersey. ACEs service territory covers approximately 2,700 square miles and has a population of approximately 998,000. ACE is a wholly owned subsidiary of Conectiv, which is wholly owned by Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI or Pepco Holdings). Because PHI is a public utility holding company subject to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005), the relationship between PHI and ACE and certain activities of ACE are subject to the regulatory oversight of FERC under PUHCA 2005. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The accompanying results of operations discussion is for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Other than this disclosure, information under this item has been omitted in accordance with General Instruction I(2)(a) to the Form 10 K. All amounts in the tables (except sales and customers) are in millions. 135 Operating Revenue 2005 2004 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 355.2 $ 351.6 $ 3.6 Default Supply Revenue 1,147.0 962.0 185.0 Other Electric Revenue 18.2 19.6 (1.4 ) Total Operating Revenue $ 1,520.4 $ 1,333.2 $ 187.2 The table above shows the amount of Operating Revenue earned that is subject to price regulation (Regulated T&D (Transmission and Distribution) Electric Revenue and Default Supply Revenue) and that which is not subject to price regulation (Other Electric Revenue). Regulated T&D Electric Revenue consists of the revenue ACE receives for delivery of electricity to its customers for which service ACE is paid regulated rates. Default Supply Revenue is the revenue received by ACE for providing Default Electricity Supply. The costs related to the supply of electricity are included in Fuel and Purchased Energy expense. Also included in Default Supply Revenue is revenue from non utility generators (NUGS), transition bond charges, market transition charges (MTC) and other restructuring related revenues (see Deferred Electric Service Costs). Other Electric Revenue includes work and services performed on behalf of customers including other utilities, which is not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rents, late payments, and collection fees. Regulated T&D Electric Regulated T&D Electric Revenue 2005 2004 Change Residential $ 175.8 $ 170.4 $ 5.4 Commercial 108.5 110.9 (2.4 ) Industrial 16.1 17.3 (1.2 ) Other (Includes PJM) 54.8 53.0 1.8 Total Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 355.2 $ 351.6 $ 3.6 Regulated T&D Electric Sales (Gwh) 2005 2004 Change Residential 4,444 4,275 169 Commercial 4,366 4,337 29 Industrial 1,224 1,213 11 Other 46 49 (3 ) Total Regulated T&D Electric Sales 10,080 9,874 206 Regulated T&D Electric Customers (000s) 2005 2004 Change Residential 468 461 7 Commercial 62 61 1 Industrial 1 1 Other 1 1 Total Regulated T&D Electric Customers 532 524 8 136 Regulated T&D Electric Revenue increased by $3.6 million primarily due to the following: (i) $6.8 million increase due to weather, the result of a 28% increase in Cooling Degree Days in 2005, (ii) $4.3 million due to customer growth, the result of a 1.5% customer increase in 2005, offset by (iii) $4.0 million reduction in estimated unbilled revenue recorded in the second quarter of 2005, primarily reflecting higher estimated power line losses (estimates of electricity expected to be lost in the process of its transmission and distribution to customers) and (iv) $3.5 million decrease due to other sales and rate variances. Default Electricity Supply Default Supply Revenue 2005 2004 Change Residential $ 367.8 $ 336.5 $ 31.3 Commercial 278.7 264.9 13.8 Industrial 46.2 49.0 (2.8 ) Other (Includes PJM) 454.3 311.6 142.7 Total Default Supply Revenue $ 1,147.0 $ 962.0 $ 185.0 Default Electricity Supply Sales (Gwh) 2005 2004 Change Residential 4,456 4,244 212 Commercial 3,028 2,991 37 Industrial 338 386 (48 ) Other 46 48 (2 ) Total Default Electricity Supply Sales 7,868 7,669 199 Default Electricity Supply Customers (000s) 2005 2004 Change Residential 467 460 7 Commercial 62 61 1 Industrial 1 1 Other 1 1 Total Default Electricity Supply Customers 531 523 8 137 Default Supply Revenue is primarily subject to deferral accounting, with differences in revenues and expenses deferred to the balance sheet for subsequent recovery under the New Jersey restructuring deferral. The $185.0 million increase in Default Supply Revenue primarily resulted from the following: (i) $142.2 million increase in wholesale energy revenues from sales of generated and purchased energy into PJM (included in Other) due to higher market prices in 2005, (ii) $22.3 million increase due to weather, primarily in the third quarter of 2005, (iii) $16.8 million increase due to higher retail energy rates resulting from the new market based New Jersey BGS effective October 2005, (iv) $10.3 million due to other sales and rate variances, and (v) $9.8 million increase due to customer growth, offset by (vi) $8.5 million decrease resulting from customer migration (load) and (vii) $7.9 million decrease due to a reduction in estimated unbilled revenue recorded in the second quar ter of 2005, primarily reflecting higher estimated power line losses (estimates of electricity expected to be lost in the process of its transmission and distribution to customers). Default Supply Revenue is partially offset in Fuel and Purchased Power expense. ACEs New Jersey customers served by an alternate supplier represented 22% of ACEs total load for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Operating Expenses Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Costs of Sales Fuel and Purchased Energy increased by $105.3 million to $912.0 million in 2005, from $806.7 million in 2004. The increase is primarily due to: (i) $84.5 million increase in higher average energy costs, the result of New Jersey BGS supply contracts in June 2005 and (ii) $21.6 million increase due to customer growth and (iii) $15.2 million increase in other sales and rate variances, partially offset by (iv) $16.0 million decrease due to higher customer migration. This expense is primarily offset in Default Supply Revenue. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and Amortization expenses decreased by $8.9 million to $123.9 million in 2005, from $132.8 million in 2004. The decrease is primarily due to a $7.6 million decrease from a change in depreciation technique resulting from a 2005 final rate order from the NJBPU. Other Taxes Other Taxes increased by $2.2 million to $22.9 million in 2005, from $20.7 million in 2004. The increase is primarily due to a $2.5 million true up for the Transitional Electricity Facilities Adjustment (TEFA), which decreased Other Taxes expense in 2004. 138 Deferred Electric Service Costs Deferred Electric Service Costs increased by $83.9 million to $120.2 million in 2005, from $36.3 million in 2004. The $83.9 million increase represents (i) $77.1 million net over recovery associated with New Jersey BGS, NUGS, market transition charges and other restructuring items and (ii) $4.5 million in regulatory disallowances (net of amounts previously reserved) associated with the April 2005 NJBPU settlement agreement. At December 31, 2005, ACEs balance sheet included as a regulatory liability an over recovery of $40.9 million with respect to these items, which is net of a $47.3 million reserve for items disallowed by the NJBPU in a ruling that is under appeal. Gain on Sale of Assets Gain on Sale of Assets represents a $14.7 million gain from the 2004 condemnation settlement with the City of Vineland, New Jersey relating to the transfer of ACEs distribution assets and customer accounts to the city. Other Income (Expenses) Other expenses decreased by $3.2 million to a net expense of $50.7 million in 2005, from a net expense of $53.9 million in 2004. The decrease is primarily due to (i) lower interest expense resulting from maturities of debt in March, July and August of 2005 and (ii) an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates in 2005. Income Tax Expenses ACEs effective tax rate before extraordinary item for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 44% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference were state income taxes (net of federal benefit), the flow through of certain book tax depreciation differences and changes in estimates related to tax liabilities of prior tax years subject to audit (primarily due to the mixed service cost issue under IRS Rule 2005 43), partially offset by the flow through of deferred investment tax credits. ACEs effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2004 was 41% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference were state income taxes (net of federal benefit) and the flow through of certain book tax depreciation differences, partially offset by the flow through of deferred investment tax credits. Extraordinary Item On April 19, 2005, ACE, the staff of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU), the New Jersey Ratepayer Advocate, and active intervenor parties agreed on a settlement in ACEs electric distribution rate case. As a result of this settlement, ACE reversed $15.2 million in accruals related to certain deferred costs that are now deemed recoverable. The after tax credit to income of $9.0 million is classified as an extraordinary gain in the 2005 financial statements since the original accrual was part of an extraordinary charge in conjunction with the accounting for competitive restructuring in 1999. 139 RISK FACTORS The business of ACE is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the events or conditions identified below. The occurrence of one or more these events or conditions could have an adverse effect on the business of ACE, including, depending on the circumstances, its results of operations and financial condition. ACE is a public utility that is subject to substantial governmental regulation. If ACE receives unfavorable regulatory treatment, ACEs business could be negatively affected. ACEs utility business is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local regulatory agencies that significantly affects its operations. ACEs operations are regulated in New Jersey by the NJBPU with respect to, among other things, the rates it can charge retail customers for the supply and distribution of electricity. In addition, the rates that ACE can charge for electricity transmission are regulated by FERC. ACE cannot change supply, distribution or transmission rates without approval by the applicable regulatory authority. While the approved distribution and transmission rates are intended to permit ACE to recover its costs of service and earn a reasonable rate of return, ACEs profitability is affected by the rates it is able to charge. In addition, if the costs incurred by ACE in operating its transmission and distribution facilities exceed the allowed amounts for costs included in the approved rates, ACEs financial results will be adversely affected. ACE also is required to have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from governmental agencies that regulate its business. ACE believes that it has obtained or sought renewal of the material permits, approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations and that its business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, ACE is unable to predict the impact of future regulatory activities of any of these agencies on its business. Changes in or reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations, or the imposition of new laws or regulations, may require ACE to incur additional expenses or to change the way it conducts its operations. The operating results of ACE fluctuate on a seasonal basis and can be adversely affected by changes in weather. ACEs electric utility business is seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on its operating performance. Demand for electricity is generally greater in the summer months associated with cooling and in the winter months associated with heating as compared to other times of the year. Accordingly, ACE historically has generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer. ACEs facilities may not operate as planned or may require significant maintenance expenditures, which could decrease its revenues or increase its expenses. Operation of generation, transmission and distribution facilities involves many risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment, accidents, labor disputes and performance below expected levels. Older facilities and equipment, even if maintained in accordance with sound engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures for additions or upgrades to keep them operating at peak efficiency, to comply with changing environmental requirements, or to provide reliable operations. Natural disasters and weather related incidents, including tornadoes, hurricanes and snow and ice storms, also can disrupt generation, 140 transmission and distribution delivery systems. Operation of generation, transmission and distribution facilities below expected capacity levels can reduce revenues and result in the incurrence of additional expenses that may not be recoverable from customers or through insurance. Furthermore, if ACE is unable to perform its contractual obligations for any of these reasons, it may incur penalties or damages. ACEs transmission facilities are interconnected with the facilities of other transmission facility owners whose actions could have a negative impact on ACEs operations. The transmission facilities of ACE are directly interconnected with the transmission facilities of contiguous utilities and, as such, are part of an interstate power transmission grid. FERC has designated a number of regional transmission operators to coordinate the operation of portions of the interstate transmission grid. ACE is a member of PJM, which is the regional transmission operator that coordinates the movement of electricity in all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. ACE operates its transmission facilities under the direction and control of PJM. PJM and the other regional transmission operators have established sophisticated systems that are designed to ensure the reliability of the operation of transmission facilities and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impact on the operations of the o ther utilities. However, the systems put in place by PJM and the other regional transmission operators may not always be adequate to prevent problems at other utilities from causing service interruptions in the transmission facilities of ACE. If ACE were to suffer such a service interruption, it could have a negative impact on its business. The cost of compliance with environmental laws is significant and new environmental laws may increase ACEs expenses. ACEs operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, spill prevention, waste management, natural resources, site remediation, and health and safety. These laws and regulations require ACE to make capital expenditures and to incur other expenditures to, among other things, meet emissions standards, conduct site remediation and perform environmental monitoring. ACE also may be required to pay significant remediation costs with respect to third party sites. If ACE fails to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond its control, such failure could result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities and the need to expend significant sums to come into compliance. In addition, ACE incurs costs to obtain and comply with a variety of environmental permits, licenses, inspections and other approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval, or if ACE fails to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, operations at affected facilities could be halted or subjected to additional costs. New environmental laws and regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, could impose more stringent limitations on ACEs operations or require it to incur significant additional costs. ACEs current compliance strategy may not successfully address the relevant standards and interpretations of the future. 141 Changes in technology may adversely affect ACEs electricity delivery businesses. Increased conservation efforts and advances in technology could reduce demand for electricity supply and distribution, which could adversely affect ACEs business. In addition, changes in technology also could alter the channels through which retail electric customers buy electricity, which could adversely affect ACEs business. Acts of terrorism could adversely affect ACEs business. The threat of, or actual acts of, terrorism may affect ACEs operations in unpredictable ways and may cause changes in the insurance markets, force ACE to increase security measures and cause disruptions of power markets. If any of ACEs fuel storage, generation, transmission or distribution facilities were to be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism, its operations could be adversely affected. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism also could affect the ability of ACE to raise needed capital. ACEs insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all casualty losses that it might incur. ACE currently has insurance coverage for its facilities and operations in amounts and with deductibles that it considers appropriate. However, there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, some risks, such as weather related casualties, may not be insurable. In the case of loss or damage to property, plant or equipment, there is no assurance that the insurance proceeds, if any, received will be sufficient to cover the entire cost of replacement or repair. ACE may be adversely affected by economic conditions. Periods of slowed economic activity generally result in decreased demand for power, particularly by industrial and large commercial customers. As a consequence, recessions or other downturns in the economy may result in decreased revenues and cash flows for ACE. ACE is dependent on its ability to successfully access capital markets. An inability to access capital may adversely affect its business. ACE relies on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity and to satisfy its capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from its operations. Capital market disruptions, or a downgrade in ACEs credit ratings, would increase the cost of borrowing or could adversely affect its ability to access one or more financial markets. Disruptions to the capital markets could include, but are not limited to: recession or an economic slowdown; the bankruptcy of one or more energy companies; significant increases in the prices for oil or other fuel; a terrorist attack or threatened attacks; or a significant transmission failure. 142 In accordance with the requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and the SEC rules thereunder, ACEs management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and is required to assess annually the effectiveness of these controls. The inability to certify the effectiveness of these controls due to the identification of one or more material weaknesses in these controls also could increase the financing costs of PHI and its subsidiaries or could adversely affect their ability to access one or more financial markets. ACEs future defined benefit plan funding obligations are affected by its assumptions regarding the valuation of its benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets; actual experience which varies from the assumptions could result in an obligation of ACE to make significant unplanned cash contributions to the plan. ACE follows the guidance of SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" in accounting for pension benefits under the Retirement Plan, a non contributory defined benefit plan. In accordance with these accounting standards, ACE makes assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. Changes in assumptions such as the use of a different discount rate or expected return on plan assets, affect the calculation of projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit obligations (ABO), reported pension benefit obligation on ACEs Consolidated Balance Sheet, and reported annual net periodic pension benefit cost on ACEs Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Furthermore, if actual pension plan experience is different from that which is expected, the ABO could be greater than the fair value of pension plan assets. If this were to occur, ACE could be required to recognize an additional minimum liability as prescribed by SFAS No. 87. The liability would be recorded as a reduction to common equity through a charge to Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), and would not affect net income for the year. The charge to OCI would be restored through common equity in future periods when the fair value of plan assets exceeded the ABO. ACEs funding policy is to make cash contributions to the pension plan sufficient for plan assets to exceed the ABO, and avoid the recognition of an additional minimum liability. Use of alternative assumptions could also impact the expected future cash funding requirements for the pension plan if ACEs defined benefit plan did not meet the minimum funding requirements of ERISA. Energy companies are subject to adverse publicity, which may render ACE vulnerable to negative regulatory and litigation outcomes. The energy sector has been among the sectors of the economy that have been the subject of highly publicized allegations of misconduct in recent years. In addition, many utility companies have been publicly criticized for their performance during recent natural disasters and weather related incidents. Adverse publicity of this nature may render legislatures, regulatory authorities, and other government officials less likely to view energy companies such as ACE in a favorable light and may cause ACE to be susceptible to adverse outcomes with respect to decisions by such bodies. Because ACE is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of PHI, PHI can exercise substantial control over its dividend policy and business and operations. All of the members of ACEs board of directors, as well as many of ACEs executive officers, are officers of PHI. Among other decisions, ACEs board is responsible for decisions regarding 143 payment of dividends, financing and capital raising activities, and acquisition and disposition of assets. Within the limitations of applicable law, and subject to the financial covenants under ACEs outstanding debt instruments, ACEs board of directors will base its decisions concerning the amount and timing of dividends, and other business decisions, on ACEs earnings, cash flow and capital structure, but may also take into account the business plans and financial requirements of PHI and its other subsidiaries.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK GENERAL INFORMATION As of March 2003, Conectiv Energy ceased all proprietary trading activities, which generally consist of the entry into contracts to take a view of market direction, capture market price change, and put capital at risk. PHIs competitive energy segments are no longer engaged in proprietary trading; however, the market exposure under certain contracts entered into prior to cessation of proprietary trading activities was not eliminated due to the illiquid market environment to execute such elimination. Some of these contracts remained in place through December 2005. The competitive energy segments actively engage in commodity risk management activities to reduce their financial exposure to changes in the value of their assets and obligations due to commodity price fluctuations. Certain of these risk management activities are conducted using instruments classified as derivatives under SFAS 133. In addition, the competitive energy segments also manage commodity risk with contracts that are not classified as derivatives. The competitive energy segments primary risk management objectives are to manage the spread between the cost of fuel used to operate their electric generation plants and the revenue received from the sale of the power produced by those plants and manage the spread between retail sales commitments and the cost of supply used to service those commitments in order to ensure stable and known minimum cash flows and fix favorable prices and margins when they become available. To a lesser extent, Conectiv Energy also engages in market activities in an effort to profit from short term geographical price differentials in electricity prices among markets. PHI collectively refers to these energy market activities, including its commodity risk management activities, as "other energy commodity" activities and identifies this activity separately from that of the discontinued proprietary trading activity. PHIs risk management policies place oversight at the senior management level through the Corporate Risk Management Committee which has the responsibility for establishing corporate compliance requirements for the competitive energy segments energy market participation. PHI uses a value at risk (VaR) model to assess the market risk of its competitive energy segments other energy commodity activities and its remaining proprietary trading contracts. PHI also uses other measures to limit and monitor risk in its commodity activities, including limits on the nominal size of positions and periodic loss limits. VaR represents the potential mark to market loss on energy contracts or portfolios due to changes in market prices for a specified time period and confidence level. PHI estimates VaR using a delta gamma variance / covariance model with a 95 percent, one tailed confidence level and assuming a one day holding period. Since VaR is an estimate, it is not necessarily indicat ive of actual results that may occur. 147 Value at Risk Associated with Energy Contracts For the Year Ended December 31, 2005 (Millions of dollars) Proprietary Trading VaR (1) VaR for Competitive Energy Activity (2) 95% confidence level, one day holding period, one tailed(3) Period end $0 $17.0 Average for the period $0 $ 9.7 High $0 $23.1 Low $0 $ 2.9 Notes: (1) Includes all remaining proprietary trading contracts entered into prior to cessation of this activity prior to March 2003. (2) This column represents all energy derivative contracts, normal purchase and sales contracts, modeled generation output and fuel requirements and modeled customer load obligations for both the discontinued proprietary trading activity and the ongoing other energy commodity activities. (3) As VaR calculations are shown in a standard delta or delta/gamma closed form 95% 1 day holding period 1 tail normal distribution form, traditional statistical and financial methods can be employed to reconcile prior Form 10 K and Form 10 Q VaRs to the above approach. In this case, 5 day VaRs divided by the square root of 5 equal 1 day VaRs; and 99% 1 tail VaRs divided by 2.326 times 1.645 equal 95% 1 tail VaRs. Note that these methods of conversion are not valid for converting from 5 day or less holding periods to over 1 month holding periods and should not be applied to "non standard closed form" VaR calculations in any case. For additional quantitative and qualitative information on the fair value of energy contracts see Note (13) "Use of Derivatives in Energy and Interest Rate Hedging Activities" to the consolidated financial statements of Pepco Holdings included in Item 8. The competitive energy segments portfolio of electric generating plants includes "mid merit" assets and peaking assets. Mid merit electric generating plants are typically combined cycle units that can quickly change their megawatt output level on an economic basis. These plants are generally operated during times when demand for electricity rises and power prices are higher. The competitive energy segments dynamically (economically) hedge both the estimated plant output and fuel requirements as the estimated levels of output and fuel needs change. Dynamic (or economic) hedge percentages include the estimated electricity output of and fuel requirements for the competitive energy segments generation plants that have been economically hedged and any associated financial or physical commodity contracts (including derivative contracts that are classified as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133, other derivative instruments, wholesale normal purchase and sales contracts, and load service obligations). 148 During the fourth quarter of 2005, Conectiv Energy revised its energy commodity hedging targets to reflect several factors, including improving market conditions that are predicted for the eastern portion of the PJM power market. Conectiv Energy intends to maintain a forward 36 month program with targeted ranges for hedging energy and capacity margins as follows: Month Target Range 1 12 50 100% 13 24 25 75% 25 36 0 50% The primary purpose of the hedging program is to improve the predictability and stability of generation margins by selling forward a portion of its projected plant output, and buying forward a portion of its projected fuel supply requirements. Within each period, hedged values can vary significantly above or below the average reported values. As of December 31, 2005, Conectiv Energy was within the established target ranges for each of the forward twelve month periods. The projected amount of on peak output hedged on average was 91%, 66% and 18% for the 1 12 month, 13 24 month and 25 36 month forward periods respectively. While Conectiv Energy attempts to place hedges that are expected to generate energy margins at or near its forecasted gross margin levels, the volumetric percentages vary significantly by month and often do not capture the peak pricing hours and the related high margins that can be realized. As a result the percentage of on peak output hedged does not represent the amount of expected value hedged. Not all of Conectiv Energys Merchant Generation gross margins can be hedged such as ancillary services and fuel switching. Also the hedging of locational value and capacity can be limited. These margins can be material to Conectiv Energy. 149 This table provides information on the competitive energy segments credit exposure, net of collateral, to wholesale counterparties. Schedule of Credit Risk Exposure on Competitive Wholesale Energy Contracts (Millions of dollars) December 31, 2005 Rating (1) Exposure Before Credit Collateral (2) Credit Collateral (3) Net Exposure Number of Counterparties Greater Than 10% * Net Exposure of Counterparties Greater Than 10% Investment Grade $440.8 $147.1 $293.7 1 $64.8 Non Investment Grade 7.1 1.0 6.1 No External Ratings 29.2 15.6 13.6 Credit reserves $ 2.4 (1) Investment Grade primarily determined using publicly available credit ratings of the counterparty. If the counterparty has provided a guarantee by a higher rated entity (e.g., its parent), it is determined based upon the rating of its guarantor. Included in "Investment Grade" are counterparties with a minimum Standard & Poors or Moodys rating of BBB or Baa3, respectively. (2) Exposure before credit collateral includes the MTM energy contract net assets for open/unrealized transactions, the net receivable/payable for realized transactions and net open positions for contracts not subject to MTM. Amounts due from counterparties are offset by liabilities payable to those counterparties to the extent that legally enforceable netting arrangements are in place. Thus, this column presents the net credit exposure to counterparties after reflecting all allowable netting, but before considering collateral held. (3) Credit collateral the face amount of cash deposits, letters of credit and performance bonds received from counterparties, not adjusted for probability of default, and, if applicable, property interests (including oil and gas reserves). * Using a percentage of the total exposure.
