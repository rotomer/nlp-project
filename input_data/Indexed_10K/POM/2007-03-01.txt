MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The information required by this item is contained herein, as follows: Registrants Page No. Pepco Holdings 43 Pepco 110 DPL 117 ACE 125 41 THIS PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK. 42 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PEPCO HOLDINGS, INC. GENERAL OVERVIEW Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI or Pepco Holdings) is a diversified energy company that, through its operating subsidiaries, is engaged primarily in two principal business operations: electricity and natural gas delivery (Power Delivery), and competitive energy generation, marketing and supply (Competitive Energy). In 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, PHIs Power Delivery operations produced 61%, 58% and 61% of PHIs consolidated operating revenues (including revenues from intercompany amounts) and 67%, 74% and 70% of PHIs consolidated operating income (including income from intercompany transactions). The Power Delivery business consists primarily of the transmission, distribution and default supply of electric power, which for 2006, 2005, and 2004, was responsible for 95%, 94% and 95%, respectively, of Power Deliverys operating revenues. The distribution of natural gas contributed 5%, 6% and 5% of Power Deliverys operating revenues in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Power Delivery represents one operating segment for financial reporting purposes. The Power Delivery business is conducted by three utility subsidiaries: Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco), Delmarva Power & Light Company (DPL) and Atlantic City Electric Company (ACE). Each of these companies is a regulated public utility in the jurisdictions that comprise its service territory. Each company is responsible for the distribution of electricity and, in the case of DPL, natural gas in its service territory, for which it is paid tariff rates established by the applicable local public service commissions. Each company also supplies electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territory who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier. The regulatory term for this supply service varies by jurisdiction as follows: Delaware Provider of Last Resort service (POLR) before May 1, 2006 Standard Offer Service (SOS) on and after May 1, 2006 District of Columbia SOS Maryland SOS New Jersey Basic Generation Service (BGS) Virginia Default Service In this Form 10 K, these supply service obligations are referred to generally as Default Electricity Supply. Pepco, DPL and ACE are also responsible for the transmission of wholesale electricity into and across their service territories. The rates each company is permitted to charge for the wholesale transmission of electricity are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory 43 Commission (FERC). Effective June 1, 2006, new FERC approved transmission rates took effect for each of PHIs utility subsidiaries. These new rates incorporate true ups for the formula rates that went into effect June 1, 2005, on a tentative basis, which reflected a requested 12.9% return on equity, as compared to the approved rates, which were based on a return on equity of 10.8% for existing facilities and 11.3% for facilities put into service on or after January 1, 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2006, lower transmission revenues resulted in a $.06 decrease in PHIs earnings per share as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, a portion of which was attributable to the lower rates combined with the operation of the true up adjustment to compensate for the higher tentative rates. PHI expects the lower rates in effect and the true up to have a similar proportionate impact on earnings through May 2007 as compared to 2005 earnings. However, because the magnitude of the true u p for this first twelve month period, June 2006 through May 2007, was attributable in part to the transition to the new formula rate process, PHI expects that the impact of the annual true up adjustment will be less significant in future years. The profitability of the Power Delivery business depends on its ability to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on its capital investments through the rates it is permitted to charge. Power Deliverys operating revenue and income are seasonal, and weather patterns may have a material impact on operating results. In addition, customer usage may be affected by economic conditions, energy prices, and energy efficiency measures. The Competitive Energy business provides competitive generation, marketing and supply of electricity and gas, and related energy management services primarily in the mid Atlantic region. These operations are conducted through subsidiaries of Conectiv Energy Holding Company (collectively, Conectiv Energy) and Pepco Energy Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, Pepco Energy Services), each of which is treated as a separate operating segment for financial reporting purposes. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the operating revenues of the Competitive Energy business (including revenue from intercompany transactions) were equal to 46%, 51% and 50%, respectively, of PHIs consolidated operating revenues, and the operating income of the Competitive Energy business (including operating income from intercompany transactions) was 20%, 16% and 19% of PHIs consolidated operating income for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 , respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, amounts equal to 12%, 14% and 16% respectively, of the operating revenues of the Competitive Energy business were attributable to electric energy and capacity, and natural gas sold to the Power Delivery segment. Conectiv Energy provides wholesale electric power, capacity and ancillary services in the wholesale markets administered by PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM) and also supplies electricity to other wholesale market participants under long and short term bilateral contracts. Conectiv Energy also supplies electric power to satisfy a portion of ACEs New Jersey, Pepcos Maryland and DPLs Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia Default Electricity Supply load, as well as default electricity supply load shares of other utilities. PHI refers to these activities as Merchant Generation & Load Service. Conectiv Energy obtains the electricity required to meet its Merchant Generation & Load Service power supply obligations from its own generation plants, bilateral contract purchases from other wholesale market participants, and purchases in the PJM wholesale market. Conectiv Energy also sells natural gas and fuel oil to very large end users and to wholesale market participants under bilateral agreements. P HI refers to these sales operations as Energy Marketing. 44 Pepco Energy Services provides retail energy supply and energy services primarily to commercial, industrial, and government customers. Pepco Energy Services sells electricity and natural gas to customers primarily in the mid Atlantic region. Pepco Energy Services owns and operates two district energy systems, provides energy savings performance contracting services, and designs, constructs and operates combined heat and power and central energy plants. Pepco Energy Services provides high voltage construction and maintenance services to customers throughout the U.S. and low voltage construction and maintenance services in the Washington, D.C. area and owns and operates electric generating plants in Washington, D.C. Conectiv Energys primary objective is to maximize the value of its generation fleet by leveraging its operational and fuel flexibilities. Pepco Energy Services primary objective is to capture retail energy supply and service opportunities primarily in the mid Atlantic region. The financial results of the Competitive Energy business can be significantly affected by wholesale and retail energy prices, the cost of fuel to operate the Conectiv Energy plants, and the cost of purchased energy necessary to meet its power supply obligations. The Competitive Energy business, like the Power Delivery business, is seasonal, and therefore weather patterns can have a material impact on operating results. Over the last several years, PHI has discontinued its investments in non energy related businesses, and has sold its aircraft investments and its 50% interest in Starpower Communications, LLC (Starpower). Through its subsidiary, Potomac Capital Investment Corporation (PCI), PHI continues to maintain a portfolio of cross border energy sale leaseback transactions with a book value at December 31, 2006 of approximately $1.3 billion. This activity constitutes a fourth operating segment, which is designated as "Other Non Regulated," for financial reporting purposes. For a discussion of PHIs cross border leasing transactions, see "Regulatory and Other Matters Federal Income Tax Treatment of Cross Border Leases" below. BUSINESS STRATEGY PHIs business strategy is to remain a regional diversified energy delivery utility and competitive energy services company focused on value creation and operational excellence. This strategy has three primary components: Achieving earnings growth in the Power Delivery business by focusing on infrastructure investments and constructive regulatory outcomes, while maintaining a high level of operational excellence. Supplementing PHIs utility earnings through competitive energy businesses that focus on serving the competitive wholesale and retail markets primarily in PJM. Maintaining PHIs investment grade credit ratings. EARNINGS OVERVIEW Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2005 PHIs net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $248.3 million, or $1.30 per share, compared to $371.2 million, or $1.96 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2005. 45 Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006, included the credits (charges) set forth below, which are presented net of federal and state income taxes and are in millions of dollars.

The operating segment that recognized the credits (charges) is also indicated. Power Delivery Favorable impact of $5.1 related to the ACE base rate case settlement as follows: Ordinary loss from write offs of regulatory assets, net of reserve $ (3.9) Extraordinary gain from reversal of restructuring reserves 9.0 Total $ 5.1 Gain on sale of assets, specifically non utility land $ 40.7 Increase in income tax expense for the interest accrued on the potential impact of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) mixed service cost issue $(10.9) Gain on settlement of Pepcos $105 million allowed, pre petition general unsecured claim against Mirant Corporation and its predecessors and its subsidiaries (Mirant) (the Pepco TPA Claim) and the Pepco asbestos claim against Mirant bankruptcy estate $ 42.2 Conectiv Energy Impairment charge to reduce the value of an investment in a jointly owned generation project $ (2.6) Other Non Regulated Gain related to the final liquidation of a PCI financial investment that was written off in a prior year $ 8.9 Excluding the items listed above for the year ended December 31, net income would have been $254.1 million in 2006 and $287.8 million in 2005. PHIs net income for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, by operating segment, is set forth in the table below (millions of dollars): 46 2006 2005 Change Power Delivery $191.3 $302.1 $(110.8) Conectiv Energy 47.1 48.1 (1.0) Pepco Energy Services 20.6 25.7 (5.1) Other Non Regulated 50.2 43.7 6.5 Corp. & Other (60.9) (48.4) (12.5) Total PHI Net Income $248.3 $371.2 $(122.9) Discussion of Operating Segment Net Income Variances: Power Deliverys earnings were $110.8 million lower in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to the following: $42.2 million decrease in earnings due to the gain on settlement of Pepco TPA Claim and Pepco asbestos claim against Mirant bankruptcy estate in 2005. $40.7 million decrease in earnings due to the gain on sale of assets (specifically, non utility land) in 2005. $33.9 million decrease in earnings due to lower regulated distribution sales, primarily the impact of milder weather. $10.9 million decrease in earnings due to a FERC network transmission formula rate change in June 2006. $5.1 million decrease in earnings as a result of the reversal of restructuring reserves associated with the ACE base rate case settlement in 2005. $3.6 million decrease in earnings related to a change in the 2005 unbilled revenue accrual balance of ACE. $3.1 million decrease in operation and maintenance expenses (primarily lower employee expenses and outside legal services; partially offset by increased electric system emergency restoration and maintenance activity). $2.8 million increase in Default Electricity Supply margins, primarily as a result of higher procurement costs for the period January 22, 2005 to February 8, 2005 (which represents the period between the expiration of certain transition power agreements between Pepco and Mirant and commencement of the fully compensatory SOS rates in the District of Columbia). $7.4 million increase in earnings resulting from a charge in 2005 related to a change by DPL and ACE in the estimation of unbilled revenue, primarily reflecting an increase in the amount of estimated power line losses. $20.6 million increased earnings related to a reduction in income taxes (primarily due to a 2005 accrual of $10.9 million for the potential impact of the mixed service cost issue and other favorable tax audit adjustments in 2006). 47 Power Delivery realized a .9% growth in the number of customers in 2006. However, weather adjusted sales for the calendar year 2006 have decreased by .7% in 2006 compared to an increase of 1.2% in 2005. Conectiv Energys earnings were $1.0 million lower in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to the following: $21.8 million decrease resulting primarily from milder weather, lower spark spreads, and an unplanned outage at Hay Road resulted in 26% decrease in generation output, which was partially offset by favorable hedges. $3.1 million increase in operation and maintenance expenses. $8.8 million decrease in earnings from other net activity (higher interest expense, 2005 Burney distribution and termination of an agreement to provide operating services with an unaffiliated operating plant). $12.3 million increase resulting primarily from increased margins from new default electricity supply contracts, lower supply costs, and a mark to market gain on a supply contract. $9.9 million increase related to higher Energy Marketing margins. $7.9 million gain on the disposition of assets associated with a cogeneration facility. $2.6 million increase in earnings due to an impairment charge to reduce the value of an investment in an energy project in 2005. Pepco Energy Services earnings were $5.1 million lower in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to the following: $13.7 million (net of tax) of impairment losses related to certain energy services business assets. $7.6 million decrease in earnings from the power generation plants (milder weather and higher fuel oil prices in 2006 resulted in 62% lower generation output). $12.4 million increase in earnings from its retail energy supply business, primarily due to more favorable supply costs and gains on sale of excess energy supply in 2006. $5.3 million increase in earnings from energy services activity due to increased construction projects and thermal energy sales in 2006. Other Non Regulated earnings were $6.5 million higher in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to the following: $6.2 million increase in earnings due to favorable tax audit adjustments. $2.5 million increase in financial investment earnings (including the gain in 2005 related to the final liquidation of a financial investment that was written off in a prior year). $2.0 million increase in earnings due to decreases in interest and other expenses. $4.8 million decrease in earnings due to gain on the sale of PCIs Solar Electric Generation Stations investment in 2005. 48 Corp. & Other earnings were $12.5 million lower in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to the $9.1 million recorded by the affected operating segments and eliminated in consolidation through Corp. & Other. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following results of operations discussion is for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. All amounts in the tables (except sales and customers) are in millions. Operating Revenue A detail of the components of PHIs consolidated operating revenue is as follows: 2006 2005 Change Power Delivery $ 5,118.8 $ 4,702.9 $ 415.9 Conectiv Energy 2,157.3 2,603.6 (446.3) Pepco Energy Services 1,668.9 1,487.5 181.4 Other Non Regulated 90.6 84.5 6.1 Corp. & Other (672.7) (813.0) 140.3 Total Operating Revenue $ 8,362.9 $ 8,065.5 $ 297.4 Power Delivery Business The following table categorizes Power Deliverys operating revenue by type of revenue. 2006 2005 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 1,533.2 $ 1,623.2 $ (90.0) Default Supply Revenue 3,271.9 2,753.0 518.9 Other Electric Revenue 58.3 65.2 (6.9) Total Electric Operating Revenue 4,863.4 4,441.4 422.0 Regulated Gas Revenue 204.8 198.7 6.1 Other Gas Revenue 50.6 62.8 (12.2) Total Gas Operating Revenue 255.4 261.5 (6.1) Total Power Delivery Operating Revenue $ 5,118.8 $ 4,702.9 $ 415.9 Regulated Transmission and Distribution (T&D) Electric Revenue consists of revenue from the transmission and the delivery of electricity including Default Electricity Supply to PHIs customers within its service territories at regulated rates. Default Supply Revenue is the revenue received for Default Electricity Supply. The costs related to Default Electricity Supply are included in Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales. 49 Other Electric Revenue consists of utility related work and services performed on behalf of customers, including other utilities. Regulated Gas Revenue consists of revenues for on system natural gas sales and the transportation of natural gas for customers within PHIs service territories at regulated rates. Other Gas Revenue consists of off system natural gas sales and the release of excess system capacity. Electric Operating Revenue Regulated T&D Electric Revenue 2006 2005 Change Residential $ 575.7 $ 613.0 $ (37.3) Commercial 699.0 726.8 (27.8) Industrial 28.6 36.8 (8.2) Other (Includes PJM) 229.9 246.6 (16.7) Total Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 1,533.2 $ 1,623.2 $ (90.0) Regulated T&D Electric Sales (gigawatt hours (Gwh)) 2006 2005 Change Residential 17,139 18,045 (906) Commercial 28,638 29,441 (803) Industrial 4,119 4,288 (169) Total Regulated T&D Electric Sales 49,896 51,774 (1,878) Regulated T&D Electric Customers (000s) 2006 2005 Change Residential 1,605 1,591 14 Commercial 198 196 2 Industrial 2 2 Total Regulated T&D Electric Customers 1,805 1,789 16 The Pepco, DPL and ACE service territories are located within a corridor extending from Washington, D.C. to southern New Jersey. These service territories are economically diverse and include key industries that contribute to the regional economic base. Commercial activity in the region includes banking and other professional services, government, insurance, real estate, strip malls, casinos, stand alone construction, and tourism. Industrial activity in the region includes automotive, chemical, glass, pharmaceutical, steel manufacturing, food processing, and oil refining. 50 Regulated T&D Revenue decreased by $90.0 million primarily due to the following: (i) $51.2 million decrease in sales due to weather, the result of a 16% decrease in Heating Degree Days and 12% decrease in Cooling Degree Days in 2006, (ii) $18.5 million decrease due to a change in Delaware rate structure effective May 1, 2006, which shifted revenue from Regulated T&D Electric Revenue to Default Supply Revenue, (iii) $17.1 million decrease in network transmission revenues due to lower rates approved by FERC in June 2006, (iv) $7.0 million decrease due to a Delaware base rate reduction effective May 1, 2006, primarily offset by (v) $12.9 million increase in sales due to a 0.9% increase in the number of customers. Default Electricity Supply Default Supply Revenue 2006 2005 Change Residential $ 1,482.2 $ 1,161.7 $ 320.5 Commercial 1,348.6 994.9 353.7 Industrial 108.2 134.2 (26.0) Other (Includes PJM) 332.9 462.2 (129.3) Total Default Supply Revenue $ 3,271.9 $ 2,753.0 $ 518.9 Default Electricity Supply Sales (Gwh) 2006 2005 Change Residential 16,698 17,490 (792) Commercial 14,799 15,020 (221) Industrial 1,379 2,058 (679) Other 129 157 (28) Total Default Electricity Supply Sales 33,005 34,725 (1,720) Default Electricity Supply Customers (000s) 2006 2005 Change Residential 1,575 1,557 18 Commercial 170 181 (11) Industrial 1 2 (1) Other 2 2 Total Default Electricity Supply Customers 1,748 1,742 6 Default Supply Revenue increased $518.9 million, representing an 18.8% increase despite a 5% decrease in Gwh sales. This increase was primarily due to the following: (i) an increase of $709.3 million attributable to higher retail electricity rates, primarily resulting from market based rates beginning in Delaware on May 1, 2006 and annual increases in Default Electricity Supply rates during the year in the District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, and Virginia, primarily offset by (ii) $142.1 million decrease in wholesale energy revenues from sales of generated and purchased energy in PJM due to lower market prices in the third quarter of 2006 and the sale by ACE of its interests in the Keystone and Conemaugh generating plants, effective September 1, 2006, and (iii) $93.1 million decrease in sales due to milder weather (a 16% decrease in Heating Degree Days and a 12% decrease in Cooling Degree Days in 2006). 51 Other Electric Revenue Other Electric Revenue decreased $6.9 million to $58.3 million in 2006 from $65.2 million in 2005 primarily due to a decrease in customer requested work.

Several key industries contribute to the economic base as well as to growth. Commercial activity in the region includes banking and other professional services, government, insurance, real estate, strip malls, stand alone construction and tourism. Industrial activity in the region includes automotive, chemical and pharmaceutical. Regulated Gas Revenue increased by $6.1 million primarily due to (i) a $33.2 million increase in revenues as the result of Gas Cost Rate (GCR) increases effective November 1, 2006 and November 1, 2005, as a result of higher natural gas commodity costs (primarily offset in Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Costs of Sales expense), offset by (ii) a $22.3 million decrease in sales due to milder weather (a 17% decrease in Heating Degree Days in 2006), and (iii) a $4.8 million decrease primarily due to differences in consumption among various customer rate classes. 52 Other Gas Revenue Other Gas Revenue decreased by $12.2 million to $50.6 million in 2006 from $62.8 million in 2005 primarily due to lower off system sales (partially offset in Gas Purchased expense). Competitive Energy Businesses Conectiv Energy The impact of Operating Revenue changes and Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales changes with respect to the Conectiv Energy component of the Competitive Energy business are encompassed within the discussion that follows. Operating Revenues of the Conectiv Energy segment are derived primarily from the sale of electricity. The primary components of its Costs of Sales are fuel and purchased power. Because fuel and electricity prices tend to move in tandem, price changes in these commodities from period to period can have a significant impact on Operating Revenue and Costs of Sales without signifying any change in the performance of the Conectiv Energy segment. For this reason, PHI from a managerial standpoint focuses on gross margin as a measure of performance. Conectiv Energy Gross Margin The following discussion of the results of operations for the Conectiv Energy segment combines as a single business activity designated as "Merchant Generation & Load Service" the activities that in prior reports were designated as "Merchant Generation" and "Full Requirements Load Service." This change has been implemented because Full Requirements Load Service contracts are primarily used, along with other hedges already contained in the prior "Merchant Generation" category, to hedge capacity and energy output from Conectiv Energys generation plants. Merchant Generation & Load Service consists primarily of electric power, capacity and ancillary services sales from Conectiv Energys generating plants; tolling arrangements entered into sell energy and other products from Conectiv Energys generating plants and to purchase energy and other products from generating plants of other companies; hedges of power, capacity, fuel and load; the sale of excess fuel (primarily natural gas) and emission allowances; electric power, capacity, and ancillary services sales pursuant to competitively bid contracts entered into with affiliated and non affiliated companies to fulfill their default electricity supply obligations; and fuel switching activities made possible by the multi fuel capabilities of some of Conectiv Energys power plants. In addition, the activity designated as "Other Power, Oil and Gas Marketing Services" in previous reports has been renamed "Energy Marketing". Energy Marketing activities continue to consist primarily of wholesale natural gas and fuel oil marketing; the activities of the real time power desk, which generates margin by capturing price differences between power pools, and locational and timing differences within a power pool; and prior to October 31, 2006, provided operating services under an agreement with an unaffiliated generating plant. 53 December 31, 2006 2005 Operating Revenue ($ millions): Merchant Generation & Load Service $1,347.1 $1,524.4 Energy Marketing 810.2 1,079.2 Total Operating Revenue1 $2,157.3 $2,603.6 Cost of Sales ($ millions): Merchant Generation & Load Service $1,116.4 $1,276.3 Energy Marketing 785.6 1,068.1 Total Cost of Sales2 $1,902.0 $2,344.4 Gross Margin ($ millions): Merchant Generation & Load Service $ 230.7 $ 248.1 Energy Marketing 24.6 11.1 Total Gross Margin $ 255.3 $ 259.2 Generation Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses ($ millions) 3: Generation Fuel Expenses 4,5 Natural Gas $ 161.5 $ 95.4 Coal 53.3 46.7 Oil 26.6 104.6 Other6 4.1 4.9 Total Generation Fuel Expenses $ 245.5 $ 251.6 Purchased Power Expenses 5 $ 431.1 $ 539.0 Statistics: 2006 2005 Generation Output (MWh): Base Load 7 1,814,516 1,738,280 Mid Merit (Combined Cycle) 8 2,081,872 2,971,294 Mid Merit (Oil Fired) 9 115,120 694,887 Peaking 131,930 190,688 Tolled Generation 94,064 70,834 Total 4,237,502 5,665,983 Load Service Volume (MWh) 10 8,514,719 14,230,888 Average Power Sales Price 11 ($/MWh): Generation Sales 4 $77.69 $87.62 Non Generation Sales 12 $73.79 $53.16 Total $74.77 $60.12 Average on peak spot power price at PJM East Hub ($/MWh) 13 $65.29 $83.35 Average around the clock spot power price at PJM East Hub ($/MWh) 13 $53.07 $66.05 Average spot natural gas price at market area M3 ($/MMBtu)14 $ 7.31 $ 9.69 Weather (degree days at Philadelphia Airport): 15 Heating degree days 4,205 4,966 Cooling degree days 1,136 1,306 1 Includes $664.1 million and $801.8 million of affiliate transactions for 2006 and 2005, respectively. 2 Includes $197.7 million and $217.7 million of affiliate transactions for 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Lower sales of default electricity supply was a lesser factor. Merchant Generation & Load Service gross margin decreased 7%. Milder weather during 2006, coupled with lower spark spreads and an unplanned summer outage at the Hay Road generating facility, resulted in a 26% decrease in output from Conectiv Energys generating plants. Sales of ancillary services and fuel switching activities contributed less to gross margin in 2006 than in 2005. New higher margin default electricity service contracts (which replaced expiring higher volume, but lower margin default electricity supply sales), a mark to market gain on a supply contract, and hedging gains helped reduce the gross margin decrease. Energy Marketing gross margins increased $13.5 million in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to improved inventory management in the oil marketing business that resulted in a $9.2 million increase and increased gross margins of $7.7 million in the gas marketing business from gains on storage, transportation, and supply contracts. The gross margin increase was partially offset by $3.3 million due to the expiration and associated termination costs of a contract to provide operating services for an unaffiliated generation station which expired on October 31, 2006. Pepco Energy Services Pepco Energy Services operating revenue increased $181.4 million primarily due to (i) an increase of $265.6 million due to higher retail electricity customer load in 2006 and (ii) an increase of $44.3 million due to higher energy services project revenue in 2006 resulting from increased construction activity partially offset by lower revenue related to the sale of five businesses in 2006; partially offset by (iii) a decrease of $93.8 million due to lower natural gas volumes in 2006 as a result of fewer customers served and milder weather, (iv) a decrease of $29.0 million due to reduced electricity generation by the Benning and Buzzard power plants in 2006 due to milder weather and higher fuel oil prices, and (v) a decrease of $5.7 million in mass market products and services revenue, a business Pepco Energy Services exited in 2005. As of December 31, 2006, Pepco Energy Services had 3,544 megawatts of commercial and industrial load, as compared to 2,034 megawatts of commerci al and industrial load at the end of 2005. In 2006, Pepco Energy Services power plants generated 89,578 megawatt hours of electricity as compared to 237,624 in 2005. Other Non Regulated Other Non Regulated revenue increased $6.1 million to $90.6 million in 2006 from $84.5 million in 2005. Operating revenues consist of lease earnings recognized under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 13 and changes to the carrying value of the other miscellaneous investments. Operating Expenses Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales A detail of PHIs consolidated Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales is as follows: 55 2006 2005 Change Power Delivery $ 3,303.6 $ 2,720.5 $ 583.1 Conectiv Energy 1,902.0 2,344.4 (442.4) Pepco Energy Services 1,531.1 1,357.5 173.6 Corp. & Other (670.8) (810.4) 139.6 Total $ 6,065.9 $ 5,612.0 $ 453.9 Power Delivery Business Power Deliverys Fuel and Purchased Energy costs associated with Default Electricity Supply sales increased by $583.1 million primarily due to: (i) $736.8 million increase in average energy costs, resulting from higher costs of Default Electricity Supply contracts that went into effect primarily in June 2006 and 2005, offset by (ii) $155.5 million decrease primarily due to differences in consumption among the various customer rate classes (impact due to such factors as weather, migration, etc). Competitive Energy Business Conectiv Energy The impact of Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales changes with respect to the Conectiv Energy component of the Competitive Energy business are encompassed within the prior discussion under the heading "Conectiv Energy Gross Margin." Pepco Energy Services Pepco Energy Services Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales increased $173.6 million due to (i) a $246.5 million increase in purchases of electricity in 2006 to serve higher retail customer load and (ii) an increase of $37.2 million in costs due to higher energy services projects in 2006 as a result of increased construction activity; partially offset by (iii) a decrease of $87.6 million for purchases of natural gas due to lower volumes sold in 2006 as the result of fewer customers served and milder weather, (iv) a $17.6 million decrease in electricity generation costs in 2006 due to reduced electricity generation by the Benning and Buzzard power plants as a result of milder weather and higher fuel oil prices, (v) a $4.9 million decrease in mass market products and services costs, a business Pepco Energy Services exited in 2005, and (vi) decreased costs due to the sale of five companies in 2006. Other Operation and Maintenance A detail of PHIs other operation and maintenance expense is as follows: 2006 2005 Change Power Delivery $ 639.6 $ 643.1 $ (3.5) Conectiv Energy 116.3 107.7 8.6 Pepco Energy Services 67.6 71.2 (3.6) Other Non Regulated 4.2 5.2 (1.0) Corp. & Other (20.4) (11.5) (8.9) Total $ 807.3 $ 815.7 $ (8.4) 56 The higher operation and maintenance expenses of the Conectiv Energy segment were primarily due to planned and unplanned facility outages. The impact of this increase was substantially offset by lower corporate expenses related to the amortization of non compete agreements and other administrative and general expenses. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by $14.1 million to $413.2 million in 2006, from $427.3 million in 2005. The decrease is primarily due to (i) a $5.4 million change in depreciation technique resulting from the ACE distribution base rate case settlement in 2005 that depreciates assets over their whole life versus their remaining life, (ii) a $4.1 million reduction of ACE regulatory debits, and (iii) a $3 million reduction due to completion of amortization related to software, offset by net increases to plant in service (adds less retirements) of about $5.4 million. Deferred Electric Service Costs Deferred Electric Service Costs decreased by $98.1 million to $22.1 million in 2006, from $120.2 million in 2005. The $98.1 million decrease was attributable to (i) $92.4 million net under recovery associated with New Jersey BGS, NUGs, market transition charges and other restructuring items and (ii) $5.7 million in regulatory disallowances (net of amounts previously reserved) in connection with the ACE distribution base rate case settlement in 2005. At December 31, 2006, ACEs balance sheet included as a regulatory liability an over recovery of $164.9 million with respect primarily to these items, which is net of a $46.0 million reserve for items disallowed by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) in a ruling that is under appeal. The $164.9 million regulatory liability also includes an $81.3 million gain related to the September 1, 2006 sale of ACEs interests in Keystone and Conemaugh. Impairment Losses For the year ended December 31, 2006, Pepco Holdings recorded pre tax impairment losses of $18.9 million ($13.7 million after tax) related to certain energy services business assets owned by Pepco Energy Services. The impairments were recorded as a result of the execution of contracts to sell certain assets and due to the lower than expected production and related estimated cash flows from other assets. The fair value of the assets under contracts for sale was determined based on the sales contract price, while the fair value of the other assets was determined by estimating future expected production and cash flows. Gain on Sales of Assets Pepco Holdings recorded a Gain on Sales of Assets of $.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $86.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The $86.8 million gain in 2005 primarily consisted of: (i) a $68.1 million gain from the sale of non utility land owned by Pepco located at Buzzard Point in the District of Columbia, and (ii) a $13.3 million gain recorded by PCI from proceeds related to the final liquidation of a financial investment that was written off in 2001. 57 Gain on Settlement of Claims with Mirant The Gain on Settlement of Claims with Mirant of $70.5 million in 2005 represents a settlement (net of customer sharing) with Mirant of the Pepco TPA Claim ($70 million gain) and a Pepco asbestos claim against the Mirant bankruptcy estate ($.5 million gain). See "Regulatory and Other Matters Relationship with Mirant Corporation" for additional information. Other Income (Expenses) Other Expenses (which are net of other income) decreased by $3.1 million to $282.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $285.5 million for the same period in 2005. The decrease primarily resulted from an increase in income from equity fund valuations at PCI of $7.3 million and $2.3 in lower impairment charges during 2006 compared to 2005, partially offset by a $6.6 million gain in 2005 related to the sale of an investment. Income Tax Expense Pepco Holdings effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 39% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference were state income taxes (net of federal benefit), and the flow through of certain book/tax depreciation differences, partially offset by the flow through of Deferred Investment Tax Credits and tax benefits related to certain leveraged leases. Pepco Holdings effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 41% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference were state income taxes (net of federal benefit), changes in estimates related to tax liabilities of prior tax years under audit, and the flow through of certain book/tax depreciation differences, partially offset by the flow through of Deferred Investment Tax Credits and tax benefits related to certain leveraged leases. The following results of operations discussion is for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004.

Higher fuel and energy prices in 2005 resulted in costlier load service and negative hedge results. This was partially offset by a 10% increase in Merchant Generation output primarily driven by warmer weather during the summer months of 2005 and continued PJM load growth. Energy Marketing margins decreased because of a one time gain of $8.7 million on a group of coal contracts in 2004. This was partially offset by higher margin sales for oil marketing ($5.6 million) and gas marketing ($2.0 million) during the fourth quarter of 2005. Pepco Energy Services The increase in Pepco Energy Services operating revenue of $320.9 million is primarily due to (i) an increase of $228.1 million due to commercial and industrial retail load acquisition by Pepco Energy Services in 2005 at higher prices than in 2004, (ii) an increase of $39.3 million due to higher generation from its Benning and Buzzard Point power plants in 2005 due to warmer weather conditions, and (iii) an increase of $49.5 million due to higher energy services activities in 2005 resulting from contracts signed with customers under which Pepco Energy Services provides services for energy efficiency and high voltage installation projects. As of December 31, 2005, Pepco Energy Services had 2,034 megawatts of commercial and industrial load, as compared to 1,663 megawatts of commercial and industrial load at the end of 2004. In 2005, Pepco Energy Services power plants generated 237,624 megawatt hours of electricity as compared to 45,836 in 2004. Operating Expenses Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales A detail of PHIs consolidated Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales is as follows: 2005 2004 Change Power Delivery $ 2,720.5 $ 2,524.2 $ 196.3 Conectiv Energy 2,344.4 2,130.9 213.5 Pepco Energy Services 1,357.5 1,064.4 293.1 Corporate and Other (810.4) (829.0) 18.6 Total $ 5,612.0 $ 4,890.5 $ 721.5 Power Delivery Business Power Deliverys Fuel and Purchased Energy costs increased by $196.3 million primarily due to (i) $326.7 million increase for higher average energy costs resulting from Default Electricity Supply contracts implemented in 2005, (ii) $65.6 million increase due to customer growth, (iii) $33.1 million increase for gas commodity purchases, (iv) $25.8 million increase in other sales and rate variances, offset by (v) $254.9 million decrease due to higher customer migration. This expense is primarily offset in Default Supply Revenue. 63 Conectiv Energy The impact of Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales changes with respect to the Conectiv Energy component of the Competitive Energy business is encompassed within the prior discussion heading "Conectiv Energy Gross Margin." Pepco Energy Services Pepco Energy Services fuel and purchased energy and other services cost of sales increased $293.1 million due to (i) higher volumes of electricity purchased at higher prices in 2005 to serve commercial and industrial retail customers, (ii) higher fuel and operating costs for the Benning and Buzzard Point power plants in 2005 due to higher electric generation that resulted from warmer weather in 2005, and (iii) higher energy services activities in 2005 resulting from contracts signed with customers under which Pepco Energy Services provides services for energy efficiency and high voltage installation projects. Other Operation and Maintenance A detail of PHIs other operation and maintenance expense is as follows: 2005 2004 Change Power Delivery $ 643.1 $ 623.9 $ 19.2 Conectiv Energy 107.7 103.8 3.9 Pepco Energy Services 71.2 71.5 (.3) Other Non Regulated 5.2 4.6 .6 Corporate and Other (11.5) (7.2) (4.3) Total $ 815.7 $ 796.6 $ 19.1 PHIs other operation and maintenance increased by $19.1 million to $815.7 million for the year ended 2005 from $796.6 million for the year ended 2004 primarily due to the following: (i) a $10.3 million increase in employee related costs, (ii) $9.0 million increase in corporate services allocation, (iii) $3.9 million increase due to the write off of software, (iv) $3.2 million increase due to mutual assistance work related to storm damage in 2005 (offset in Other Electric Revenues), and (v) $2.1 million increase in maintenance expenses, partially offset by (vi) $4.9 million reduction in the uncollectible account reserve to reflect the amount expected to be collected on unpaid obligations of Mirant to Pepco existing at the time of filing of Mirants bankruptcy petition consisting primarily of payments due Pepco with respect to Mirants obligations to purchase from Pepco the capacity and energy that Pepco is obligated to purchase under a power purchase agreement with Panda Bran dywine, L.P. and (vii) a $5.5 million decrease in PJM administrative expenses. Depreciation and Amortization PHIs depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by $18.9 million to $427.3 million in 2005 from $446.2 million in 2004. The decrease is primarily due to a $7.6 million decrease from a change in depreciation technique resulting from a 2005 final rate order from the NJBPU and a $4.8 million decrease due to a change in the estimated useful lives of Conectiv Energys generation assets. 64 Other Taxes Other taxes increased by $30.8 million to $342.2 million in 2005 from $311.4 million in 2004 due to higher pass throughs, mainly as the result of a county surcharge rate increase (primarily offset in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue). Deferred Electric Service Costs Deferred Electric Service Costs, which relates only to ACE, increased by $83.9 million to $120.2 million in 2005, from $36.3 million in 2004. At December 31, 2005, DESC represents the net expense or over recovery associated with New Jersey NUGs, market transition change and other restructuring items. The $83.9 million increase represents (i) $77.1 million net over recovery associated with New Jersey BGS, NUGs, market transition charges and other restructuring items, and (ii) $4.5 million in regulatory disallowances (net of amounts previously reserved) associated with the April 2005 NJBPU settlement agreement. ACEs rates for the recovery of those costs are reset annually and the rates will vary from year to year. At December 31, 2005, ACEs balance sheet included as a regulatory liability an over recovery of $40.9 million with respect to these items, which is net of a $47.3 million reserve for items disallowed by the NJBPU in a ruling that is under appeal. Gain on Sales of Assets Pepco Holdings recorded a Gain on Sales of Assets of $86.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $30.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The $86.8 million gain in 2005 primarily consists of: (i) a $68.1 million gain from the 2005 sale of non utility land owned by Pepco located at Buzzard Point in the District of Columbia, and (ii) a $13.3 million gain recorded by PCI from proceeds related to the final liquidation of a financial investment that was written off in 2001. The $30.0 million gain in 2004 consists of: (i) a $14.7 million gain from the 2004 condemnation settlement with the City of Vineland relating to the transfer of ACEs distribution assets and customer accounts to the city, (ii) a $6.6 million gain from the 2004 sale of land, and (iii) an $8.3 million gain on the 2004 sale of aircraft investments by PCI. Gain on Settlement of Claims with Mirant The Gain on Settlement of Claims with Mirant of $70.5 million in 2005 represents a settlement (net of customer sharing) with Mirant of the Pepco TPA Claim ($70 million gain) and a Pepco asbestos claim against the Mirant bankruptcy estate ($.5 million gain). See "Regulatory and Other Matters Relationship with Mirant Corporation" for additional information. Other Income (Expenses) Other expenses (which are net of other income) decreased by $55.9 million to $285.5 million in 2005 from $341.4 million in 2004, primarily due to the following: (i) a decrease in net interest expense of $35.7 million, which primarily resulted from a $23.6 million decrease due to less debt outstanding during the 2005 period and a decrease of $12.8 million of interest expense that was recorded by Conectiv Energy in 2004 related to costs associated with the prepayment of debt related to the Bethlehem mid merit facility, (ii) an $11.2 million impairment charge on the Starpower investment that was recorded during 2004, (iii) income of $7.9 million received by PCI in 2005 from the sale and liquidation of energy investments, and (iv) income of $3.9 million 65 in 2005 from cash distributions from a joint owned cogeneration facility, partially offset by (v) an impairment charge of $4.1 million in 2005 related to a Conectiv Energy investment in a jointly owned generation project, and (vi) a pre tax gain of $11.2 million on the distribution of a cogeneration joint venture that was recognized by Conectiv Energy during the second quarter of 2004. Income Tax Expense Pepco Holdings effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 41% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference were state income taxes (net of federal benefit), changes in estimates related to tax liabilities of prior tax years under audit and the flow through of certain book/tax depreciation differences, partially offset by the flow through of Deferred Investment Tax Credits and tax benefits related to certain leveraged leases. Pepco Holdings effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2004 was 39% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference were state income taxes (net of federal benefit), the flow through of certain book/tax depreciation differences, and the settlement with the IRS on certain non lease financial assets, partially offset by the flow through of Deferred Investment Tax Credits, tax benefits related to certain leveraged leases, and the benefit associated with the retroactive adjustment for the issuance of final consolidated tax return regulations by a taxing authority. Extraordinary Item On April 19, 2005, ACE, the staff of the NJBPU, the New Jersey Ratepayer Advocate, and active intervenor parties agreed on a settlement in ACEs electric distribution rate case. As a result of this settlement, ACE reversed $15.2 million in accruals related to certain deferred costs that are now deemed recoverable. The after tax credit to income of $9.0 million is classified as an extraordinary gain in the 2005 financial statements since the original accrual was part of an extraordinary charge in conjunction with the accounting for competitive restructuring in 1999. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY This section discusses Pepco Holdings working capital, cash flow activity, capital requirements and other uses and sources of capital. Working Capital At December 31, 2006, Pepco Holdings current assets on a consolidated basis totaled $2.0 billion and its current liabilities totaled $2.5 billion. At December 31, 2005, Pepco Holdings current assets on a consolidated basis totaled $2.1 billion and its current liabilities totaled $2.4 billion. PHIs working capital deficit results primarily from the fact that, in the normal course of business, PHIs utility subsidiaries acquire energy supplies for their customers before the supplies are delivered to, metered and billed to customers. Short term financing is used to meet liquidity needs. Short term financing is also used, at times, to temporarily fund redemptions of long term debt, until long term replacement financings are completed. 66 At December 31, 2006, Pepco Holdings cash and cash equivalents and its restricted cash totaled $60.8 million, none of which was net cash collateral held by subsidiaries of PHI engaged in Competitive Energy or Default Electricity Supply activities. At December 31, 2005, Pepco Holdings cash and cash equivalents and its restricted cash, totaled $144.5 million. Of the 2005 total, $112.8 million consisted of net cash collateral held by subsidiaries of PHI engaged in Competitive Energy and Default Electricity Supply activities (none of which was held as restricted cash). See "Capital Requirements Contractual Arrangements with Credit Rating Triggers or Margining Rights" for additional information. A detail of PHIs short term debt balance and its current maturities of long term debt and project funding balance follows. Current maturities of long term debt may be temporarily funded with short term financing until long term replacement financings are completed.

Cash Source (Use) 2006 2005 2004 (Millions of dollars) Net Income $248.3 $371.2 $260.6 Non cash adjustments to net income 543.0 48.3 527.6 Changes in working capital (588.7) 567.4 (72.5) Net cash from operating activities $202.6 $986.9 $715.7 Net cash from operating activities decreased by $784.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. In addition to the decrease in net income, the factors contributing to the decrease in cash flow from operating activities included: (i) an increase of $194.5 million in taxes paid in 2006, including a tax payment of $121 million made in February 2006 (see "Regulatory and Other Matters IRS Mixed Service Cost Issue" below), (ii) a decrease in the change in regulatory assets and liabilities of $107.9 million due primarily to the 2005 over recoveries associated with New Jersey BGS, NUGs, market transition charges and other restructuring items, and (iii) the collateral requirements associated with the activities of Competitive Energy, which in 2006 required the net posting of cash collateral with third parties, whereas in 2005 PHI was a net holder of net cash collateral. Changes in cash collateral include the following: The balance of net cash collateral held by PHI was $112.8 million as of December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2006, Competitive Energy activities and Default Electricity Supply purchase agreements of PHIs utility subsidiaries required the posting by PHI of cash collateral in the amount of $99.0 million (a total decrease of $211.8 million). The balance of net cash collateral held by PHI increased from $21.4 million as of December 31, 2004, to $112.8 million as of December 31, 2005 (a total increase of $91.4 million). Net cash from operating activities increased by $271.2 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. A $110.6 million increase in net income in 2005 as compared to 2004 is a result of improved operating results at PHIs regulated utilities. Other factors contributing to the increases in cash flow from operating activities include the following: (i) Pepcos receipt of $112.9 million in proceeds in December 2005 for the sale of the Pepco TPA Claim and the Pepco asbestos claim against the Mirant bankruptcy estate, (ii) a decrease of approximately $29 million in interest paid on debt obligations in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to a decrease in outstanding debt, (iii) an increase in power broker payables in 2005 as a result of higher electricity prices, and (iv) an increase from $21.4 million to $112.8 million in the cash collateral held in connection with Competitive Energy activities. 68 Investing Activities Cash flows used by investing activities during 2006, 2005, and 2004 are summarized below. Cash (Use) Source 2006 2005 2004 (Millions of dollars) Construction expenditures $(474.6) $(467.1) $(517.4) Cash proceeds from sale of: Starpower investment 29.0 Marketable securities, net 19.4 Office building and other properties 181.5 84.1 46.4 All other investing cash flows, net 64.0 49.1 5.3 Net cash used by investing activities $(229.1) $(333.9) $(417.3) Net cash used by investing activities decreased $104.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. The decrease is primarily due to the net proceeds received of $177.0 million related to the sale of ACEs ownership share of the Keystone and Conemaugh generating plants, offset by the $73.7 million in proceeds related to the 2005 sale of Buzzard Point land. Net cash used by investing activities decreased by $83.4 million in 2005 compared to 2004. The decrease is primarily due to a $50.3 million decrease in construction expenditures, net proceeds of $73.7 million related to the 2005 sale of Buzzard Point land, and proceeds of $33.8 million received by PCI from the sale of an energy investment and from the final liquidation of a financial investment that was written off in 2001. In 2004, PHI sold its 50% interest in Starpower for $29 million in cash. Additionally in 2004, PCI continued to liquidate its marketable securities portfolio and PHI received proceeds from the sale of aircraft and land.

All of the $514.5 million in issuances of long term debt for the year ended December 31, 2006, are discussed above. Additionally, $576.4 million of the total $578.0 million in reacquisitions of long term debt for the year ended December 31, 2006 are discussed above. In 2006, Pepco and DPL issued short term debt of $67.1 million and $91.1 million, respectively, in order to cover capital expenditures and tax obligations throughout the year. Net cash used by financing activities increased by $201.9 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. 70 Common stock dividend payments were $198.3 million in 2006, $188.9 million in 2005 and $176.0 million in 2004. The increase in common dividends paid in 2005 was due primarily to an offering of 14,950,000 shares of common stock in September 2004 and an issuance of 1,228,505 shares in 2005, under the DRP. The increase in common dividends paid in 2006 was due to the issuance of 1,232,569 shares under the DRP and a quarterly dividend increase from 25 cents per share to 26 cents per share in the first quarter of 2006. Preferred stock redemptions in 2005 totaled $9.0 million and included the following: in October 2005, Pepco redeemed 22,795 shares of its $2.44 Series 1957 Serial Preferred Stock at $1.1 million, 74,103 shares of its $2.46 Series 1958 Serial Preferred Stock at $3.7 million, and 13,148 shares of its $2.28 Series 1965 Serial Preferred Stock at $.7 million in August 2005, ACE redeemed 160 shares of its 4.35% Serial Preferred Stock at $.02 million, and in December 2005, DPL redeemed all of the 35,000 shares of its 6.75% Serial Preferred Stock outstanding at $3.5 million.

The net proceeds, plus additional funds, were used to repay commercial paper issued to fund the $300 million redemptions of Conectiv debt. In September 2005, Pepco used the proceeds from the June 2005 issuance of $175 million in senior secured notes to fund the retirement of $100 million in first mortgage bonds at maturity as well as the redemption of $75 million in first mortgage bonds prior to maturity.

Described above are $525 million of the $532 million total 2005 long term debt issuances and $727.7 million of the $755.8 million total 2005 reacquisition of long term debt. In 2005, ACE and PHI redeemed a total of $161.3 million in short term debt with cash from operations. As a result of the 2004 common stock issuance, Pepco Holdings received $278.5 million of proceeds, net of issuance costs of $10.3 million. The proceeds in combination with short term debt were used to prepay in its entirety the $335 million Conectiv Bethlehem term loan. In 2004, Pepco redeemed all of the 900,000 shares of $3.40 series mandatorily redeemable preferred stock then outstanding for $45 million and 165,902 shares of $2.28 series preferred stock for $8.3 million. 71 In 2004, Pepco Holdings redeemed $200 million of variable rate notes at maturity. In 2004, Pepco issued $275 million of secured senior notes with maturities of 10 and 30 years, the net proceeds of which were used to redeem higher interest rate securities of $210 million and to repay short term debt. Pepco borrowed $100 million under a bank loan due in 2006, and proceeds were used to redeem mandatorily redeemable preferred stock and repay short term debt.

PHIs long term debt is subject to certain covenants. PHI and its subsidiaries are in compliance with all requirements. Subsequent Financing Activities On November 17, 2006, certain institutional buyers tentatively agreed to purchase in April 2007, in a private placement, $200 million of Pepco Holdings unsecured notes having an interest rate of 6% and a term of twelve years. PHI intends to use the proceeds to repay a like amount of outstanding long term debt. On January 18, 2007, DPL redeemed all outstanding shares of its Serial Preferred Stock of each series at redemption prices ranging from 103% to 105% of par, for an aggregate redemption price of $18.9 million. Sales of ACE Generating Facilities As discussed in Note (12), Commitments and Contingencies, on September 1, 2006, ACE completed the sale of its interest in the Keystone and Conemaugh generating facilities for approximately $177.0 million, which was subsequently decreased by $1.6 million based on a post closing 60 day true up for applicable items not known at the time of closing. Additionally, on February 8, 2007, ACE completed the sale of the B.L. England generating facility for a price of $9.0 million, subject to adjustment. Sale of Interest in Cogeneration Joint Venture During the first quarter of 2006, Conectiv Energy recognized a $12.3 million pre tax gain ($7.9 million after tax) on the sale of its equity interest in a joint venture which owns a wood burning cogeneration facility in California. 72 Proceeds from Settlement of Claims with Mirant In December 2005, Pepco received proceeds of $112.9 million for the sale of the Pepco TPA Claim and the Pepco asbestos claim against the Mirant bankruptcy estate. After customer sharing, Pepco recorded a pre tax gain of $70.5 million related to the settlement of these claims. Sale of Buzzard Point Property In August 2005, Pepco sold for $75 million in cash 384,051 square feet of excess non utility land owned by Pepco located at Buzzard Point in the District of Columbia. The sale resulted in a pre tax gain of $68.1 million which was recorded as a reduction of Operating Expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Financial Investment Liquidation In October 2005, PCI received $13.3 million in cash and recorded an after tax gain of $8.9 million related to the liquidation of a financial investment that was written off in 2001. Capital Requirements Construction Expenditures Pepco Holdings construction expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $474.6 million of which $447.2 million were related to the Power Delivery businesses and the remainder related to Conectiv Energy and Pepco Energy Services. For the five year period 2007 through 2011, approximate construction expenditures are projected in the table below. The increase in the capital expenditure projections in 2006 compared to 2005 are primarily due to reliability (feeder conversions and cable and transformer replacements) and load related projects within Power Delivery, and potential generation related construction within the competitive businesses. For the Year 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Total Total $630 $618 $535 $603 $758 $3,144 Power Delivery related $581 $560 $489 $504 $573 $2,707 For details on environmental costs included in the above table, see Item 1 "Business Environmental Matters." Pepco Holdings expects to fund these expenditures through internally generated cash from the Power Delivery businesses and from external financing. Dividends Pepco Holdings annual dividend rate on its common stock is determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration, among other factors, current and possible future developments that may affect PHIs income and cash flows. In 2006, PHIs Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of 26 cents per share of common stock payable on March 31, 2006, June 30, 2006, September 29, 2006 and December 29, 2006. On January 25, 2007, the Board of Directors declared a dividend on common stock of 26 cents per share payable March 30, 2007, to shareholders of record March 12, 2007. 73 PHI generates no operating income of its own. Accordingly, its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders depends on dividends received from its subsidiaries. In addition to their future financial performance, the ability of PHIs direct and indirect subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to limits imposed by: (i) state corporate and regulatory laws, which impose limitations on the funds that can be used to pay dividends and, in the case of regulatory laws, as applicable, may require the prior approval of the relevant utility regulatory commissions before dividends can be paid, (ii) the prior rights of holders of existing and future preferred stock, mortgage bonds and other long term debt issued by the subsidiaries, and any other restrictions imposed in connection with the incurrence of liabilities, and (iii) certain provisions of ACEs certificate of incorporation which provides that, if any preferred stock is outstanding, no dividends may be paid on the ACE common sto ck if, after payment, ACEs common stock capital plus surplus would be less than the involuntary liquidation value of the outstanding preferred stock. Pepco and DPL have no shares of preferred stock outstanding. Currently, the restriction in the ACE charter does not limit its ability to pay dividends. Pension Funding Pepco Holdings has a noncontributory retirement plan (the PHI Retirement Plan) that covers substantially all employees of Pepco, DPL and ACE and certain employees of other Pepco Holdings subsidiaries. As of the 2006 valuation, the PHI Retirement Plan satisfied the minimum funding requirements of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) without requiring any additional funding. PHIs funding policy with regard to the PHI Retirement Plan is to maintain a funding level in excess of 100% of its accumulated benefit obligation (ABO). In 2006, no contribution was made to the PHI Retirement Plan. In 2005, PHI made a discretionary tax deductible cash contribution in the amount of $60 million (all of which was funded by ACE) to the PHI Retirement Plan in accordance with its funding policy. In 2006, the ABO for the PHI Retirement Plan decreased from 2005, due to an increase in the discount rate used to value the ABO obligation, which more than offset the accrual of an additional year of service for participants. The PHI Retirement Plan assets achieved returns in 2006 above the 8.50% level assumed in the valuation. As a result of the combination of these factors, no contribution was made to the PHI Retirement Plan, because the funding level at year end 2006 was in excess of 100% of the ABO. In 2005, PHI contributed a total of $60 million (all of which was funded by ACE) to the PHI Retirement Plan. Assuming no changes to the current pension plan assumptions, PHI projects no funding will be required under ERISA in 2007; however, PHI may elect to make a discretionary tax deductible contribution, if required to maintain its assets in excess of ABO for the PHI Retirement Plan. Recent legislative changes, in the form of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, impact t he funding requirements for pension plans beginning in 2008. The Pension Protection Act alters the manner in which liabilities and asset values are determined for the purpose of calculating required pension contributions. Based on preliminary actuarial projections and assuming no changes to current pension plan assumptions, PHI believes it is unlikely that there will be any required contribution in 2008. 74 Contractual Obligations And Commercial Commitments Summary information about Pepco Holdings consolidated contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2006, is as follows: Contractual Maturity Obligation (a) Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years (Millions of dollars) Variable rate demand bonds $ 154.2 $ 154.2 $ $ $ Commercial paper 195.4 195.4 Long term debt 5,093.1 855.1 405.8 601.8 3,230.4 PES project funding 25.7 2.4 4.5 3.7 15.1 Interest payments on debt 2,902.9 285.1 488.1 427.7 1,702.0 Capital leases 198.4 15.5 30.6 30.4 121.9 Operating leases 528.9 35.8 73.2 73.2 346.7 Non derivative fuel and purchase power contracts (b) 8,554.5 2,716.2 2,303.8 742.7 2,791.8 Total $17,653.1 $4,259.7 $3,306.0 $1,879.5 $8,207.9 (a) Estimates relating to the future funding of PHIs pension and other postretirement benefit plans are excluded from this table. For additional information, refer to Note (6) Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits "Cash Flows." (b) Excludes Mirants obligations to purchase from Pepco the capacity and energy that Pepco is obligated to purchase under a power purchase agreement with Panda Brandywine, L.P. (the Panda PPA) that are part of the back to back agreement that was entered into with Mirant (See "Relationship with Mirant Corporation" for additional information) and excludes ACEs BGS load supply. Third Party Guarantees, Indemnifications and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Pepco Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries have various financial and performance guarantees and indemnification obligations which are entered into in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties as discussed below. As of December 31, 2006, Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries were parties to a variety of agreements pursuant to which they were guarantors for standby letters of credit, performance residual value, and other commitments and obligations. The fair value of these commitments and obligations was not required to be recorded in Pepco Holdings Consolidated Balance Sheets; however, certain energy marketing obligations of Conectiv Energy were recorded. The commitments and obligations, in millions of dollars, were as follows: 75 Guarantor PHI DPL ACE Other Total Energy marketing obligations of Conectiv Energy (1) $ 100.9 $ $ $ $ 100.9 Energy procurement obligations of Pepco Energy Services (1) 206.7 206.7 Guaranteed lease residual values (2) .5 3.3 3.2 7.0 Other (3) 2.9 1.9 4.8 Total $ 311.0 $ 3.3 $ 3.2 $ 1.9 $ 319.4 1. Pepco Holdings has contractual commitments for performance and related payments of Conectiv Energy and Pepco Energy Services to counterparties related to routine energy sales and procurement obligations, including retail customer load obligations and requirements under BGS contracts entered into with ACE. 2. Subsidiaries of Pepco Holdings have guaranteed residual values in excess of fair value related to certain equipment and fleet vehicles held through lease agreements. As of December 31, 2006, obligations under the guarantees were approximately $7.0 million. Assets leased under agreements subject to residual value guarantees are typically for periods ranging from 2 years to 10 years. Historically, payments under the guarantees have not been made by the guarantor as, under normal conditions, the contract runs to full term at which time the residual value is minimal. As such, Pepco Holdings believes the likelihood of payment being required under the guarantee is remote. 3. Other guarantees consist of: Pepco Holdings has guaranteed a subsidiary building lease of $2.9 million. Pepco Holdings does not expect to fund the full amount of the exposure under the guarantee. PCI has guaranteed facility rental obligations related to contracts entered into by Starpower. As of December 31, 2006, the guarantees cover the remaining $1.9 million in rental obligations. 76 Energy Contract Net Asset Activity The following table provides detail on changes in the net asset or liability position of the Competitive Energy businesses (consisting of the activities of the Conectiv Energy and Pepco Energy Services segments) with respect to energy commodity contracts from one period to the next: Roll forward of Mark to Market Energy Contract Net Assets (Liabilities) For the Year Ended December 31, 2006 (Dollars are pre tax and in millions) Proprietary Trading (1) Other Energy Commodity (2) Total Total Marked to Market (MTM) Energy Contract Net Assets at December 31, 2005 $ $ 59.9 $ 59.9 Total change in unrealized fair value excluding reclassification to realized at settlement of contracts 60.3 60.3 Reclassification to realized at settlement of contracts (33.3) (33.3) Effective portion of changes in fair value recorded in Other Comprehensive Income (151.3) (151.3) Ineffective portion of changes in fair value recorded in earnings .1 .1 Total MTM Energy Contract Net Liabilities at December 31, 2006 $ $ (64.3) $ (64.3) Detail of MTM Energy Contract Net Assets at December 31, 2006 (see above) Total Current Assets (other current assets) $ 80.0 Noncurrent Assets (other assets) 15.0 Total MTM Energy Assets 95.0 Current Liabilities (other current liabilities) (128.6) Noncurrent Liabilities (other liabilities) (30.7) Total MTM Energy Contract Liabilities (159.3) Total MTM Energy Contract Net Assets (Liabilities) $ (64.3) Notes: (1) PHI discontinued its proprietary trading activities in 2003.

The table also provides the maturity, by year, of the Competitive Energy businesses mark to market energy contract net assets (liabilities), which indicates when the amounts will settle and either generate cash for, or require payment of cash by, PHI. PHI uses its best estimates to determine the fair value of the commodity and derivative contracts that its Competitive Energy businesses hold and sell.

Anticipated margin (Day 1 gain) on the transaction has been reserved in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 02 3. 78 Contractual Arrangements with Credit Rating Triggers or Margining Rights Under certain contractual arrangements entered into by PHIs subsidiaries in connection with Competitive Energy and other transactions, the subsidiary may be required to provide cash collateral or letters of credit as security for its contractual obligations if the credit ratings of the subsidiary are downgraded. In the event of a downgrade, the amount required to be posted would depend on the amount of the underlying contractual obligation existing at the time of the downgrade. As of December 31, 2006, a one level downgrade in the credit rating of PHI and all of its affected subsidiaries would have required PHI and such subsidiaries to provide an additional $389 million of aggregate cash collateral or letters of credit. PHI believes that it and its utility subsidiaries maintain adequate short term funding sources in the event the additional collateral or letters of credit are required. See "Sources of Capital Short Term Funding Sources." Many of the contractual arrangements entered into by PHIs subsidiaries in connection with Competitive Energy activities include margining rights pursuant to which the PHI subsidiary or a counterparty may request collateral if the market value of the contractual obligations reaches levels in excess of the credit thresholds established in the applicable arrangements. Pursuant to these margining rights, the affected PHI subsidiary may receive, or be required to post, collateral due to energy price movements. As of December 31, 2006, Pepco Holdings subsidiaries engaged in Competitive Energy activities and default supply activities provided cash collateral in the amount of approximately $99.0 million in connection with their competitive energy activities. Environmental Remediation Obligations PHIs accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2006 include approximately $21.3 million, of which $5.5 million is expected to be incurred in 2007, for potential environmental cleanup and other costs related to sites at which an operating subsidiary is a potentially responsible party (PRP), is alleged to be a third party contributor, or has made a decision to clean up contamination on its own property. For information regarding projected expenditures for environmental control facilities, see Item 1 "Business Environmental Matters." The principal environmental remediation obligations as of December 31, 2006, were: $6.1 million, of which $930,000 is expected to be incurred in 2007, payable by DPL in accordance with a consent agreement reached with the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) during 2001, for remediation, site restoration, natural resource damage compensatory projects and other costs associated with environmental contamination that resulted from an oil release at the Indian River power plant. That plant was sold on June 22, 2001. ACEs entry into a sale agreement in 2000 (which was subsequently terminated) for the B.L. England and Deepwater generating facilities (ACE transferred the Deepwater generating facility to Conectiv Energy in 2004) triggered the applicability of the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act requiring remediation at these facilities. When the prospective purchaser of these generating facilities terminated the agreement of sale in accordance with the agreements termination provisions, ACE decided to continue the environmental investigation process at these facilities. ACE and Conectiv Energy have been continuing the investigation with oversight from New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). Conectiv Energy anticipates that it will incur approximately $5.6 million in environmental remediation costs, of which $820,000 is 79 expected to be incurred in 2007, associated with the Deepwater generating facility. RC Cape May Holdings, LLC (RC Cape May), an affiliate of Rockland Capital Energy Investments, LLC, the purchaser of the B.L. England generating facility, has entered into a remediation agreement with the NJDEP under which it will assume responsibility for remediation at B.L. England. In the event that RC Cape May fails to remediate groundwater or other resources at B.L. England, the responsibility for such remediation will revert to ACE. DPL expects to incur costs of approximately $1.5 million (including approximately $260,000 in 2007) in connection with the Wilmington Coal Gas South site located in Wilmington, Delaware, to remediate residual material from the historical operation of a manufactured gas plant. Development pressure in the area of this site is expected to drive the scope and schedule of remediation during 2007. Pepco expects to incur approximately $820,000 for long term monitoring in connection with a pipeline oil release, of which it expects to incur $85,000 in 2007. Sources Of Capital Pepco Holdings sources to meet its long term funding needs, such as capital expenditures, dividends, and new investments, and its short term funding needs, such as working capital and the temporary funding of long term funding needs, include internally generated funds, securities issuances and bank financing under new or existing facilities. PHIs ability to generate funds from its operations and to access capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties. See Item 1A. "Risk Factors" for a discussion of important factors that may impact these sources of capital. Internally Generated Cash The primary source of Pepco Holdings internally generated funds is the cash flow generated by its regulated utility subsidiaries in the Power Delivery business. Additional sources of funds include cash flow generated from its non regulated subsidiaries and the sale of non core assets. Short Term Funding Sources Pepco Holdings and its regulated utility subsidiaries have traditionally used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs, such as commercial paper, short term notes and bank lines of credit. Proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs but may also be used to fund temporarily long term capital requirements. Pepco Holdings maintains an ongoing commercial paper program of up to $700 million. Pepco, DPL, and ACE have ongoing commercial paper programs of up to $300 million, up to $275 million, and up to $250 million, respectively. The commercial paper can be issued with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper programs of PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE are backed by a $1.2 billion credit facility. Long Term Funding Sources The sources of long term funding for PHI and its subsidiaries are the issuance of debt and equity securities and borrowing under long term credit agreements. Proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements, such as capital expenditures and new investments, and to repay or refinance existing indebtedness. 80 PUHCA 2005 Restrictions Under PUHCA 2005 and the Federal Power Act, FERC has jurisdiction (previously held by the SEC under PUHCA 1935) over the issuance of certain securities by Pepco, DPL and ACE. In accordance with regulations adopted by FERC, Pepco Holdings has notified FERC that it will continue until further notice to issue such securities under the authority granted in the financing order issued by the SEC under PUHCA 1935, which has an authorization period ending June 30, 2008 (the Financing Order). The Financing Order authorizes the issuance of equity, preferred securities and debt securities in an aggregate amount not to exceed $6 billion through an authorization period ending June 30, 2008, subject to a ceiling on the effective cost of these funds. In order to issue debt or equity securities pursuant to the Financing Order authorization, Pepco, ACE and DPL, respectively, must (a) maintain a ratio of common stock equity to total capitalization (consisting, for this purpose, of common stock, preferred stock, if any, long term debt and short term debt for this purpose) of at least 30 percent, and (b) have an "investment grade" rating by at least one nationally recognized rating agency for any rated securities issued. At December 31, 2006, the common equity ratios for purposes of the Financing Order for Pepco, DPL and ACE, respectively, were 46.2%, 44.6%, and 31.6%. If these conditions are not met, the affected utility could not issue the security under the Financing Order and may need to first obtain a new financing authorization from FERC. If FERC authorization pursuant to the Federal Power Act or FERC regulations is required to enable the utility subsidiaries to effect a financing, there is no certainty that such authorization could be obtained nor certainty as to the timing of FERC action. Money Pool Under the Financing Order, Pepco Holdings operates a system money pool. The money pool is a cash management mechanism used by Pepco Holdings to manage the short term investment and borrowing requirements of its subsidiaries that participate in the money pool. Pepco Holdings may invest in but not borrow from the money pool. Eligible subsidiaries with surplus cash may deposit those funds in the money pool. Deposits in the money pool are guaranteed by Pepco Holdings. Eligible subsidiaries with cash requirements may borrow from the money pool. Borrowings from the money pool are unsecured. Depositors in the money pool receive, and borrowers from the money pool pay, an interest rate based primarily on Pepco Holdings short term borrowing rate. Pepco Holdings deposits funds in the money pool to the extent that the pool has insufficient funds to meet the borrowing needs of its participants, which may require Pepco Holdings to borrow funds for deposit from external sources. REGULATORY AND OTHER MATTERS Relationship with Mirant Corporation In 2000, Pepco sold substantially all of its electricity generating assets to Mirant (formerly Southern Energy, Inc.). In July 2003, Mirant filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas (the Bankruptcy Court). On December 9, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Plan of Reorganization (the Reorganization Plan) of Mirant, and the Mirant business emerged 81 from bankruptcy on January 3, 2006, as a new corporation of the same name (for purposes of this section, together with its predecessors, Mirant). As part of the bankruptcy proceeding, Mirant had been seeking to reject certain ongoing contractual arrangements under the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement entered into by Pepco and Mirant for the sale of the generating assets that are described below. The Reorganization Plan did not resolve the issues relating to Mirants efforts to reject these obligations nor did it resolve certain Pepco damage claims against the Mirant bankruptcy estate. Power Purchase Agreement The Panda PPA obligates Pepco to purchase from Panda 230 megawatts of energy and capacity annually through 2021. At the time of the sale of Pepcos generating assets to Mirant, the purchase price of the energy and capacity under the Panda PPA was, and since that time has continued to be, substantially in excess of the market price. As a part of the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, Pepco entered into a "back to back" arrangement with Mirant. Under this arrangement, Mirant is obligated through 2021 to purchase from Pepco the capacity and energy that Pepco is obligated to purchase under the Panda PPA at a price equal to Pepcos purchase price from Panda (the PPA Related Obligations). The SMECO Agreement Under the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, Pepco assigned to Mirant a Facility and Capacity Agreement entered into by Pepco with Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative, Inc. (SMECO), under which Pepco was obligated to purchase from SMECO the capacity of an 84 megawatt combustion turbine installed and owned by SMECO at a former Pepco generating facility at a cost of approximately $500,000 per month until 2015 (the SMECO Agreement). Pepco is responsible to SMECO for the performance of the SMECO Agreement if Mirant fails to perform its obligations thereunder. Settlement Agreements with Mirant On May 30, 2006, Pepco, PHI, and certain affiliated companies entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release (the Settlement Agreement) with Mirant, which, subject to court approval, settles all outstanding issues between the parties arising from or related to the Mirant bankruptcy. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement: Mirant will assume the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, except for the PPA Related Obligations, which Mirant will be permitted to reject. Pepco will receive an allowed claim under the Reorganization Plan in an amount that will result in a total aggregate distribution to Pepco, net of certain transaction expenses, of $520 million, consisting of (i) $450 million in damages resulting from the rejection of the PPA Related Obligations and (ii) $70 million in settlement of other Pepco damage claims against the Mirant bankruptcy estate (the Pepco Distribution). Except as described below, the $520 million Pepco Distribution will be effected by means of the issuance to Pepco of shares of Mirant common stock (consisting of an initial distribution of 13.5 million shares of Mirant common stock, followed thereafter by a number of shares of Mirant common stock to be determined), which Pepco will be obligated to resell promptly in one or more block sale transactions. If the net proceeds 82 that Pepco receives from the resale of the shares of Mirant common stock are less than $520 million, Pepco will receive a cash payment from Mirant equal to the difference, and if the net proceeds that Pepco receives from the resale of the shares of Mirant common stock are more than $520 million, Pepco will make a cash payment to Mirant equal to the difference. If the closing price of shares of Mirant common stock is less than $16.00 per share for four business days in a twenty consecutive business day period, and Mirant has not made a distribution of shares of Mirant common stock to Pepco under the Settlement Agreement, Mirant has the one time option to elect to assume, rather than reject, the PPA Related Obligations. If Mirant elects to assume the PPA Related Obligations, the Pepco Distribution will be reduced to $70 million. All pending appeals, adversary actions or other contested matters between Pepco and Mirant will be dismissed with prejudice, and each will release the other from any and all claims relating to the Mirant bankruptcy. Separately, Mirant and SMECO have entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release (the SMECO Settlement Agreement). The SMECO Settlement Agreement provides that Mirant will assume, rather than reject, the SMECO Agreement. This assumption ensures that Pepco will not incur liability to SMECO as the guarantor of the SMECO Agreement due to the rejection of the SMECO Agreement, although Pepco will continue to guarantee to SMECO the future performance of Mirant under the SMECO Agreement. According to their terms, the Settlement Agreement and the SMECO Settlement Agreement will become effective when the Bankruptcy Court or the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas (the District Court), as applicable, has entered a final order, not subject to appeal or rehearing, approving both the Settlement Agreement and the SMECO Settlement Agreement. On August 9, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order approving the Settlement Agreement and the SMECO Settlement Agreement. On August 18, 2006, certain holders of Mirant bankruptcy claims, who had objected to approval of the Settlement Agreement and the SMECO Settlement Agreement before the Bankruptcy Court, appealed the approval order to the District Court. On December 26, 2006, the District Court issued an order affirming the Bankruptcy Courts order approving the Settlement Agreement. On January 25, 2007, the parties that previously appealed the Bankruptcy Courts order filed a notice of appeal of the District Courts order with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (the Fifth Circuit). On February 12, 2007, the Fifth Circuit issued a briefing schedule. The brief of the appealing creditors is due on March 26, 2007, while Mirants and Pepcos briefs are due on April 30, 2007. In August 2006, Mirant made a cash payment to Pepco of $70 million, which became due in accordance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement as a result of the approval of the Settlement Agreement by the Bankruptcy Court. If the Bankruptcy Court order approving the Settlement Agreement becomes a final order after the exhaustion of all appeals, the payment will be taken into account as if it were proceeds from the resale by Pepco of shares of the Mirant common stock, as described above, and treated as a portion of the $520 million payment due Pepco. If the Bankruptcy Court approval of the Settlement Agreement is not upheld on appeal, 83 Pepco must repay this cash payment to Mirant. Therefore, no income statement impact has been recognized in relation to the $70 million payment. Until the approval of the Settlement Agreement and the SMECO Settlement Agreement becomes final, Mirant is required to continue to perform all of its contractual obligations to Pepco and SMECO. Pepco intends to use the $450 million portion of the Pepco Distribution related to the rejection of the PPA Related Obligations to pay for future capacity and energy purchases under the Panda PPA. In litigation prior to the entry into the Settlement Agreement, the District Court had entered orders denying Mirants attempt to reject the PPA Related Obligations and directing Mirant to resume making payments to Pepco pursuant to the PPA Related Obligations, which Mirant had suspended. Mirant is making the payments as required by the District Court order. On July 19, 2006, the Fifth Circuit issued an opinion affirming the District Courts orders. On September 4, 2006, Mirant filed a petition for rehearing and motion to stay the appeals pending completion of the settlement between the parties. On September 12, 2006, the Fifth Circuit issued an Order denying Mirants motion for stay. On September 21, 2006, the Fifth Circuit issued an Order summarily denying Mirants petition for rehearing. The appeal period has expired and that order is now final and nonappealable. Rate Proceedings PHIs regulated utility subsidiaries currently have four active distribution base rate cases underway. Pepco has filed electric distribution base rate cases in the District of Columbia and Maryland; DPL has filed a gas distribution base rate case in Delaware (which is the subject of a settlement agreement as discussed below) and an electric base rate case in Maryland. In each of these cases, the utility has proposed the adoption of a bill stabilization adjustment mechanism (BSA) for retail customers. The BSA will increase rates if revenues from distribution deliveries fall below the level approved by the applicable regulatory commission and will decrease rates if revenues from distribution deliveries are above the commission approved level. The end result will be that the utility will collect its authorized revenues for distribution deliveries. As a consequence, a BSA "decouples" revenue from unit sales consumption and ties the growth in revenues to the growth in the num ber of customers. Some advantages of the BSA are that it (i) eliminates revenue fluctuations due to weather and changes in customer usage patterns and, therefore, provides for more predictable utility distribution revenues that are better aligned with costs, (ii) provides for more reliable fixed cost recovery, (iii) tends to stabilize customers delivery bills, and (iv) removes any disincentives for the regulated utilities to promote energy efficiency programs for their customers, because it breaks the link between overall sales volumes and delivery revenues. DPL has proposed a monthly BSA in the gas base rate case and, in each of the electric base rate cases, the companies have proposed a quarterly BSA. Delaware On August 31, 2006, DPL submitted its 2006 Gas Cost Rate (GCR) filing to the Delaware Public Service Commission (DPSC), which permits DPL to recover gas procurement costs through customer rates. The proposed decrease of approximately 9.6% is in anticipation of decreasing natural gas commodity costs. On October 3, 2006, the DPSC issued its initial order approving the proposed rates, which became effective November 1, 2006, subject to refund pending final DPSC approval after evidentiary hearings. Any amounts subject to refund would be deferred, resulting in no earnings impact. 84 On February 23, 2007, DPL submitted an additional filing to the DPSC that proposed a 4.3% decrease in the GCR effective April 1, 2007, in compliance with its gas service tariff and to ensure collections are more aligned with expenses. DPL expects DPSC approval of the rate decrease in late March 2007, subject to refund pending final DPSC approval after evidentiary hearings. On August 31, 2006, DPL submitted an application to the DPSC for an increase in gas distribution base rates, including a proposed BSA. The application requested an annual increase of approximately $15 million or an overall increase of 6.6%, including certain miscellaneous tariff fees, reflecting a proposed return on equity (ROE) of 11.00%. If the BSA is not approved, the proposed annual increase would be $15.5 million or an overall increase of 6.8%, reflecting an ROE of 11.25%. On October 17, 2006, the DPSC authorized DPL to place into effect beginning November 1, 2006, subject to refund, gas base rates designed to produce an annual interim increase in revenue of approximately $2.5 million. On February 16, 2007, all of the parties in this proceeding (DPL, DPSC staff and the Delaware Division of Public Advocate) filed a settlement agreement with the DPSC. The settlement provisions include a $9.0 million increase in distribution rates, including certain miscellaneous tarif f fees (of which $2.5 million was put into effect on November 1, 2006, as noted above), an ROE of 10.25%, and a change in depreciation rates that result in a $2.1 million reduction in pre tax annual depreciation expense. Although the settlement agreement does not include a BSA, it provides for all of the parties to the case to participate in any generic statewide proceeding for the purpose of investigating BSA mechanisms for electric and gas distribution utilities. In a separate proceeding, DPL has requested that a docket be opened for this purpose. Under the settlement agreement, rates will become effective on April 1, 2007. A DPSC decision is expected by the end of March 2007. District of Columbia In February 2006, Pepco filed an update to the District of Columbia Generation Procurement Credit (GPC) for the periods February 8, 2002 through February 7, 2004 and February 8, 2004 through February 7, 2005. The GPC provides for sharing of the profit from SOS sales. The update to the GPC in the District of Columbia takes into account the $112.4 million in proceeds received by Pepco from the December 2005 sale of an allowed bankruptcy claim against Mirant arising from a settlement agreement entered into with Mirant relating to Mirants obligation to supply energy and capacity to fulfill Pepcos SOS obligations in the District of Columbia. The filing also incorporates true ups to previous disbursements in the GPC for the District of Columbia. In the filing, Pepco requested that $24.3 million be credited to District of Columbia customers during the twelve month period beginning April 2006. On June 15, 2006, the District of Columbia Public Service Commission (DCPSC) granted conditional approval of the GPC update as filed, effective July 1, 2006. Final approval by the DCPSC is pending. On December 12, 2006, Pepco submitted an application to the DCPSC to increase electric distribution base rates, including a proposed BSA. The application requested an annual increase of approximately $46.2 million or an overall increase of 13.5%, reflecting a proposed ROE of 10.75%. If the BSA is not approved, the proposed annual increase would be $50.5 million or an overall increase of 14.8%, reflecting an ROE of 11.00%. The application also proposed a Pension/OPEB Expense Surcharge that will allow Pepco to reflect in its distribution rates the increases and decreases that occur in the level of its pension and other post employment benefits expense. A DCPSC decision is expected in mid September 2007. 85 Maryland On November 17, 2006, DPL and Pepco each submitted an application to the Maryland Public Service Commission (MPSC) to increase electric distribution base rates, including a proposed BSA. The applications requested an annual increase for DPL of approximately $18.4 million or an overall increase of 3.2%, including certain miscellaneous tariff fees, and an annual increase for Pepco of approximately $47.4 million or an overall increase of 10.9%, reflecting a proposed ROE for each of 11.00%. If the BSA is not approved, the proposed annual increase for DPL would be $20.3 million or an overall increase of 3.6%, and for Pepco would be $55.7 million or an overall increase of 12.9%, reflecting a proposed ROE for each of 11.25%. Each of the applications also proposed a Pension/OPEB Expense Surcharge that would allow the utility to reflect in its distribution rates the increases and decreases that occur in the level of its pension and other post employment benefits expense. The appli cations requested that rates go into effect on December 17, 2006. In an order dated December 11, 2006, the MPSC suspended the proposed rates pending MPSC approval. MPSC decisions are expected in June 2007. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission On May 15, 2006, Pepco, ACE and DPL updated their FERC approved formula transmission rates based on the FERC Form 1 data for 2005 for each of the utilities. These rates became effective on June 1, 2006, as follows: for Pepco, $12,009 per megawatt per year; for ACE, $14,155 per megawatt per year; and for DPL, $10,034 per megawatt per year. By operation of the formula rate process, the new rates incorporate true ups from the 2005 formula rates that were effective June 1, 2005 and the new 2005 customer demand or peak load. Also, beginning in January 2007, the new rates will be applied to 2006 customer demand data, replacing the 2005 demand data that is currently used. This demand component is driven by the prior year peak loads experienced in each respective zone. Further, the rate changes will be positively impacted by changes to distribution rates for Pepco and DPL based on the merger settlements in Maryland and the District of Columbia. The net earnings impact expected from the network transmission rate changes is estimated to be a reduction of approximately $5 million year over year (2005 to 2006). ACE Restructuring Deferral Proceeding Pursuant to orders issued by the NJBPU under the New Jersey Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act (EDECA), beginning August 1, 1999, ACE was obligated to provide BGS to retail electricity customers in its service territory who did not choose a competitive energy supplier. For the period August 1, 1999 through July 31, 2003, ACEs aggregate costs that it was allowed to recover from customers exceeded its aggregate revenues from supplying BGS. These under recovered costs were partially offset by a $59.3 million deferred energy cost liability existing as of July 31, 1999 (LEAC Liability) related to ACEs Levelized Energy Adjustment Clause and ACEs Demand Side Management Programs. ACE established a regulatory asset in an amount equal to the balance of under recovered costs. In August 2002, ACE filed a petition with the NJBPU for the recovery of approximately $176.4 million in actual and projected deferred costs relating to the provision of BGS and other restructuring related costs incurred by ACE over the four year period August 1, 1999 through July 31, 2003, net of the $59.3 million offset for the LEAC Liability. The petition also requested that ACEs rates be reset as of August 1, 2003 so that there would be no under recovery of costs 86 embedded in the rates on or after that date. The increase sought represented an overall 8.4% annual increase in electric rates. In July 2004, the NJBPU issued a final order in the restructuring deferral proceeding confirming a July 2003 summary order, which (i) permitted ACE to begin collecting a portion of the deferred costs and reset rates to recover on going costs incurred as a result of EDECA, (ii) approved the recovery of $125 million of the deferred balance over a ten year amortization period beginning August 1, 2003, (iii) transferred to ACEs then pending base rate case for further consideration approximately $25.4 million of the deferred balance (the base rate case ended in a settlement approved by the NJBPU in May 2005, the result of which is that any net rate impact from the deferral account recoveries and credits in future years will depend in part on whether rates associated with other deferred accounts considered in the case continue to generate over collections relative to costs), and (iv) estimated the overall deferral balance as of July 31, 2003 at $195 million, of which $44.6 million was disallowed recovery by ACE. Although ACE believes the record does not justify the level of disallowance imposed by the NJBPU in the final order, the $44.6 million of disallowed incurred costs were reserved during the years 1999 through 2003 (primarily 2003) through charges to earnings, primarily in the operating expense line item "deferred electric service costs," with a corresponding reduction in the regulatory asset balance sheet account. In August 2004, ACE filed a notice of appeal with respect to the July 2004 final order with the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey (the Appellate Division), which hears appeals of the decisions of New Jersey administrative agencies, including the NJBPU. Briefs in the appeal were also filed by the Division of the New Jersey Ratepayer Advocate and by Cogentrix Energy Inc., the co owner of two cogeneration power plants with contracts to sell ACE approximately 397 megawatts of electricity, as cross appellants between August 2005 and January 2006. The Appellate Division has not yet set the schedule for oral argument. Divestiture Cases District of Columbia Final briefs on Pepcos District of Columbia divestiture proceeds sharing application were filed with the DCPSC in July 2002 following an evidentiary hearing in June 2002. That application was filed to implement a provision of Pepcos DCPSC approved divestiture settlement that provided for a sharing of any net proceeds from the sale of Pepcos generation related assets. One of the principal issues in the case is whether Pepco should be required to share with customers the excess deferred income taxes (EDIT) and accumulated deferred investment tax credits (ADITC) associated with the sold assets and, if so, whether such sharing would violate the normalization provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and its implementing regulations. As of December 31, 2006, the District of Columbia allocated portions of EDIT and ADITC associated with the divested generating assets were approximately $6.5 million and $5.8 million, respectively. Pepco believes that a sharing of EDIT and ADITC would violate the IRS normalization rules. Under these rules, Pepco could not transfer the EDIT and the ADITC benefit to customers more quickly than on a straight line basis over the book life of the related assets. Since the assets are no longer owned there is no book life over which the EDIT and ADITC can be returned. If Pepco were required to share EDIT and ADITC and, as a result, the normalization rules were violated, Pepco would be unable to use accelerated depreciation on District of Columbia allocated or assigned property. In addition to sharing with customers the generation related 87 EDIT and ADITC balances, Pepco would have to pay to the IRS an amount equal to Pepcos District of Columbia jurisdictional generation related ADITC balance ($5.8 million as of December 31, 2006), as well as its District of Columbia jurisdictional transmission and distribution related ADITC balance ($4.7 million as of December 31, 2006) in each case as those balances exist as of the later of the date a DCPSC order is issued and all rights to appeal have been exhausted or lapsed, or the date the DCPSC order becomes operative. In March 2003, the IRS issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR), which would allow for the sharing of EDIT and ADITC related to divested assets with utility customers on a prospective basis and at the election of the taxpayer on a retroactive basis. In December 2005 a revised NOPR was issued which, among other things, withdrew the March 2003 NOPR and eliminated the taxpayers ability to elect to apply the regulation retroactively. Comments on the revised NOPR were filed in March 2006, and a public hearing was held in April 2006. Pepco filed a letter with the DCPSC in January 2006, in which it has reiterated that the DCPSC should continue to defer any decision on the ADITC and EDIT issues until the IRS issues final regulations or states that its regulations project related to this issue will be terminated without the issuance of any regulations. Other issues in the divestiture proceeding deal with the treatment of internal costs and cost allocations as deductions from the gross proceeds of the divestiture. Pepco believes that its calculation of the District of Columbia customers share of divestiture proceeds is correct. However, depending on the ultimate outcome of this proceeding, Pepco could be required to make additional gain sharing payments to District of Columbia customers, including the payments described above related to EDIT and ADITC. Such additional payments (which, other than the EDIT and ADITC related payments, cannot be estimated) would be charged to expense in the quarter and year in which a final decision is rendered and could have a material adverse effect on Pepcos and PHIs results of operations for those periods. However, neither PHI nor Pepco believes that additional gain sharing payments, if any, or the ADITC related payments to the IRS, if required, would have a material adverse impact on its financial position or cash flows. Maryland Pepco filed its divestiture proceeds plan application with the MPSC in April 2001. The principal issue in the Maryland case is the same EDIT and ADITC sharing issue that has been raised in the District of Columbia case. See the discussion above under "Divestiture Cases District of Columbia." As of December 31, 2006, the Maryland allocated portions of EDIT and ADITC associated with the divested generating assets were approximately $9.1 million and $10.4 million, respectively. Other issues deal with the treatment of certain costs as deductions from the gross proceeds of the divestiture. In November 2003, the Hearing Examiner in the Maryland proceeding issued a proposed order with respect to the application that concluded that Pepcos Maryland divestiture settlement agreement provided for a sharing between Pepco and customers of the EDIT and ADITC associated with the sold assets. Pepco believes that such a sharing would violate the normalization rules (discussed abo ve) and would result in Pepcos inability to use accelerated depreciation on Maryland allocated or assigned property. If the proposed order is affirmed, Pepco would have to share with its Maryland customers, on an approximately 50/50 basis, the Maryland allocated portion of the generation related EDIT ($9.1 million as of December 31, 2006), and the Maryland allocated portion of generation related ADITC. Furthermore, Pepco would have to pay to the IRS an amount equal to Pepcos Maryland jurisdictional generation related 88 ADITC balance ($10.4 million as of December 31, 2006), as well as its Maryland retail jurisdictional ADITC transmission and distribution related balance ($8.4 million as of December 31, 2006), in each case as those balances exist as of the later of the date a MPSC order is issued and all rights to appeal have been exhausted or lapsed, or the date the MPSC order becomes operative. The Hearing Examiner decided all other issues in favor of Pepco, except for the determination that only one half of the severance payments that Pepco included in its calculation of corporate reorganization costs should be deducted from the sales proceeds before sharing of the net gain between Pepco and customers. Pepco filed a letter with the MPSC in January 2006, in which it has reiterated that the MPSC should continue to defer any decision on the ADITC and EDIT issues until the IRS issues final regulations or states that its regulations project related to this issue will be terminated without the issuance of any reg ulations. In December 2003, Pepco appealed the Hearing Examiners decision to the MPSC as it relates to the treatment of EDIT and ADITC and corporate reorganization costs. The MPSC has not issued any ruling on the appeal and Pepco does not believe that it will do so until action is taken by the IRS as described above. However, depending on the ultimate outcome of this proceeding, Pepco could be required to share with its customers approximately 50 percent of the EDIT and ADITC balances described above in addition to the additional gain sharing payments relating to the disallowed severance payments, which Pepco is not contesting. Such additional payments would be charged to expense in the quarter and year in which a final decision is rendered and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for those periods. However, neither PHI nor Pepco believes that additional gain sharing payments, if any, or the ADITC related payments to the IRS, if required, would have a mate rial adverse impact on its financial position or cash flows. New Jersey In connection with the divestiture by ACE of its nuclear generating assets, the NJBPU in July 2000 preliminarily determined that the amount of stranded costs associated with the divested assets that ACE could recover from ratepayers should be reduced by approximately $94.5 million, representing the amount of the accumulated deferred federal income taxes (ADFIT) associated with the divested nuclear assets. However, due to uncertainty under federal tax law regarding whether the sharing of federal income tax benefits associated with the divested assets, including ADFIT, with ACEs customers would violate the normalization rules, ACE submitted a request to the IRS for a Private Letter Ruling (PLR) to clarify the applicable law. The NJBPU has delayed its final determination of the amount of recoverable stranded costs until after the receipt of the PLR. On May 25, 2006, the IRS issued a PLR in which it stated that returning to ratepayers any of the unamortized ADFIT attributable to accelerated depreciation on the divested assets after the sale of the assets by means of a reduction of the amount of recoverable stranded costs would violate the normalization rules. On June 9, 2006, ACE submitted a letter to the NJBPU to request that the NJBPU conduct proceedings to finalize the determination of the stranded costs associated with the sale of ACEs nuclear assets in accordance with the PLR. ACEs request remains pending. 89 Default Electricity Supply Proceedings Delaware Effective May 1, 2006, SOS replaced fixed rate POLR service for customers who do not choose an alternative electricity supplier. In October 2005, the DPSC approved DPL as the SOS provider to its Delaware delivery customers. DPL obtains the electricity to fulfill its SOS supply obligation under contracts entered pursuant to a competitive bid procedure approved by the DPSC. The bids received for the May 1, 2006, through May 31, 2007, period have had the effect of increasing rates significantly for all customer classes, including an average residential customer increase of 59%, as compared to the fixed rates previously in effect. To address this increase in rates, Delaware in April 2006 enacted legislation that provides for a deferral of the financial impact on customers of the increases through a three step phase in of the rate increases, with 15% of the increase taking effect on May 1, 2006, 25% of the increase taking effect on January 1, 2007, and any remaining balance taking effect on June 1, 2007, subject to the right of customers to elect not to participate in the deferral program. Customers who do not "opt out" of the rate deferral program are required to pay the amounts deferred, without any interest charge, over a 17 month period beginning January 1, 2008. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 53% of the eligible Delaware customers have opted not to participate in the deferral of the SOS rates offered by DPL. With approximately 47% of the eligible customers participating in the phase in program, DPL anticipates a maximum deferral balance of $51.4 million. Maryland Pursuant to orders issued by the MPSC in November 2006, Pepco and DPL each is the SOS provider to its delivery customers who do not choose an alternative electricity supplier. Each company purchases the power supply required to satisfy its SOS obligations from wholesale suppliers under contracts entered into pursuant to a competitive bid procedure approved and supervised by the MPSC. In March 2006, Pepco and DPL each announced the results of competitive bids to supply electricity to its Maryland SOS customers for one year beginning June 1, 2006. Due to significant increases in the cost of fuels used to generate electricity, the auction results had the effect of increasing the average monthly electric bill by about 38.5% and 35% for Pepcos and DPLs Maryland residential customers, respectively. On April 21, 2006, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement among Pepco, DPL, the staff of the MPSC and the Office of Peoples Counsel of Maryland, which provides for a rate mitigation plan for the residential customers of each company. Under the plan, the full increase for each companys residential customers who affirmatively elect to participate are being phased in in increments of 15% on June 1, 2006, 15.7% on March 1, 2007 and the remainder on June 1, 2007. Customers electing to participate in the rate deferral plan will be required to pay the deferred amounts over an 18 month period beginning June 1, 2007. Both Pepco and DPL will accrue the interest cost to fund the deferral program. The interest cost will be absorbed by Pepco and DPL during the period that the deferred balance is accumulated and collected from customers, to the extent of and offset against the margins that the companies otherwise would earn for providing SOS to residential customers. As of Dec ember 31, 2006, approximately 2% of Pepcos residential customers and approximately 1% of DPLs residential customers had elected to participate in the phase in program. 90 On June 23, 2006, Maryland enacted legislation that extended the period for customers to elect to participate in the phase in of higher rates and revised the obligation to provide SOS to residential and small commercial customers until further action of the General Assembly. The legislation also provides for a customer refund reflecting the difference between the interest expense on an initially projected deferred balance at a 25% customer participation level and the interest expense on a deferred balance based on actual participation levels referred to above. The total amount of the refund is approximately $1.1 million for Pepco customers and approximately $.3 million for DPL customers. At Pepcos 2% level of participation, Pepco estimates that the deferral balance, net of taxes, will be approximately $1.4 million. At DPLs 1% level of participation, DPL estimates that the deferral balance, net of taxes, will be approximately $.2 million. In July 200 6, the MPSC approved revised tariff riders filed in June 2006 by Pepco and DPL to implement the legislation. Virginia On March 10, 2006, DPL filed for a rate increase with the Virginia State Corporation Commission (VSCC) for its Virginia Default Service customers to take effect on June 1, 2006, which was intended to allow DPL to recover its higher cost for energy established by the competitive bid procedure. On June 19, 2006, the VSCC issued an order that granted a rate increase for DPL of $11.5 million ($8.5 million less than requested by DPL in its March 2006 filing), to go into effect July 1, 2006. In determining the amount of the approved increase, the VSCC applied the proxy rate calculation to DPLs fuel factor, rather than allowing full recovery of the costs DPL incurred in procuring the supply necessary for its Default Service obligation. The estimated after tax earnings and cash flow impacts of the decision are reductions of approximately $3.6 million in 2006 (including the loss of revenue in June 2006 associated with the Default Service rate increase being deferred from June 1 un til July 1) and $2.0 million in 2007. The order also mandated that DPL file an application by March 1, 2007 (which has been delayed until April 2, 2007 by subsequent VSCC order) for Default Service rates to become effective June 1, 2007, which should include a calculation of the fuel factor that is consistent with the procedures set forth in the order. In February 2007, the Virginia General Assembly passed amendments to the Virginia Electric Utility Restructuring Act (the Virginia Restructuring Act) that modified the method by which investor owned electric utilities in Virginia will be regulated by the VSCC. These amendments to the Virginia Restructuring Act, subject to further amendment or veto by the Virginia governor and subsequent action by the General Assembly, will be effective on July 1, 2007. The amendments provide that, as of December 31, 2008, the following will come to an end: (i) capped rates (the previous expiration date was December 31, 2010); (ii) DPLs Default Service obligation (previously, DPL was obligated to continue to offer Default Service until relieved of that obligation by the VSCC); and (iii) customer choice, except that customers with loads of 5 megawatts or greater will continue to be able to buy from competitive suppliers, as will smaller non residential customers tha t aggregate their loads to reach the 5 megawatt threshold and obtain VSCC approval. Additionally, if an ex customer of Default Service wants to return to DPL as its energy supplier, it must give 5 years notice or obtain approval of the VSCC that the return is in the public interest. In this event, the ex customer must take DPLs service at market based rates. DPL also believes that the amendments to the Virginia Restructuring Act will terminate, as of December 31, 2008, the ratemaking provisions within the memorandum of agreement entered into by DPL, the staff of the VSCC and the Virginia Attorney Generals office in the docket approving DPLs generating asset divestiture in 2000 (the 91 MOA), including the application of the proxy rate calculation to DPLs fuel factor as discussed above; however, the VSCCs interpretation of these provisions is not known. It should be noted that in DPLs view, in the absence these amendments, the MOA and all of its provisions (including the proxy rate calculation) expire on July 1, 2007; the VSCC staff and the Virginia Attorney General disagree with DPLs position. Assuming the ratemaking provisions of the MOA end on December 31, 2008 pursuant to the amended Virginia Restructuring Act, the amendments provide that DPL shall file a rate case in 2009 and every 2 years thereafter. The ROE to be allowed by the VSCC will be set within a range, the lower of which is essentially the average of vertically integrated investor owned electric utilities in the southeast with an upper point that is 300 basis points above that average. The VSCC has authority to set rates higher or lower to allow DPL to maintain the opportunity to earn the determined ROE and to cred it back to customers, in whole or in part, earnings that were 50 basis points or more in excess of the determined ROE. The amended Virginia Restructuring Act includes various incentive ROEs for the construction of new generation and would allow the VSCC to penalize or reward DPL for efficient operations or, if DPL were to add new generation, for generating unit performance. There are also enhanced ratemaking features if DPL pursues conservation, demand management and energy efficiency programs or pursues renewable energy portfolios. ACE Sale of Generating Assets On September 1, 2006, ACE completed the sale of its interests in the Keystone and Conemaugh generating facilities to Duquesne Light Holdings Inc. for approximately $177.0 million, which was subsequently decreased by $1.6 million based on a post closing 60 day true up for applicable items not known at the time of the closing. Approximately $81.3 million of the net gain from the sale has been used to offset the remaining regulatory asset balance, which ACE has been recovering in rates, and approximately $49.8 million of the net gain is being returned to ratepayers over a 33 month period as a credit on their bills, which began with the October 2006 billing month. The balance to be repaid to customers is $48.4 million as of December 31, 2006. On February 8, 2007, ACE completed the sale of the B.L. England generating facility to RC Cape May for a price of $9.0 million, after adjustment for, among other things, variances in the value of fuel and material inventories at the time of closing, plant operating capacity, the value of certain benefits for transferred employees and the actual closing date. The purchase price will be further adjusted based on a post closing 60 day true up for applicable items not known at the time of the closing. In addition, RC Cape May and ACE have agreed to arbitration concerning whether RC Cape May must pay to ACE, as part of the purchase price, an additional $3.1 million remaining in dispute. RC Cape May also assumed certain liabilities associated with the B.L. England generating station, including substantially all environmental liabilities. This transaction is further described below under the heading "Environmental Litigation." The sale of B.L. England will not affect the stranded costs associated with the plant that already have been securitized. ACE anticipates that approximately $9 to $10 million of additional regulatory assets related to B.L. England may, subject to NJBPU approval, be eligible for recovery as stranded costs. The emission allowance credits associated with B. L. England will be monetized for the benefit of ACEs ratepayers pursuant to the NJBPU order approving the sale. Net proceeds from the sale of the plant and monetization of the emission allowance credits, which will be determined after the sale upon resolution of certain adjustments, will be credited to ACEs ratepayers in accordance with the requirements of EDECA and NJBPU orders. 92 General Litigation During 1993, Pepco was served with Amended Complaints filed in the state Circuit Courts of Prince Georges County, Baltimore City and Baltimore County, Maryland in separate ongoing, consolidated proceedings known as "In re: Personal Injury Asbestos Case." Pepco and other corporate entities were brought into these cases on a theory of premises liability. Under this theory, the plaintiffs argued that Pepco was negligent in not providing a safe work environment for employees or its contractors, who allegedly were exposed to asbestos while working on Pepcos property. Initially, a total of approximately 448 individual plaintiffs added Pepco to their complaints. While the pleadings are not entirely clear, it appears that each plaintiff sought $2 million in compensatory damages and $4 million in punitive damages from each defendant. Since the initial filings in 1993, additional individual suits have been filed against Pepco, and significant numbers of cases have been dismissed. As a result of two motions to dismiss, numerous hearings and meetings and one motion for summary judgment, Pepco has had approximately 400 of these cases successfully dismissed with prejudice, either voluntarily by the plaintiff or by the court. As of January 31, 2007, there are approximately 180 cases still pending against Pepco in the State Courts of Maryland; of which approximately 85 cases were filed after December 19, 2000, and have been tendered to Mirant for defense and indemnification pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Mirant has agreed to assume this contractual obligation. For a description of the Settlement Agreement, see the discussion of the relationship with Mirant above. While the aggregate amount of monetary damages sought in the remaining suits (excluding those tendered to Mirant) exceeds $360 million, PHI and Pepco believe the amounts claimed by current plaintiffs are greatly exaggerated. The amount of total liability, if any, and any related insurance recovery cannot be determined at this time; however, based on information and relevant circumstances known at this time, neither PHI nor Pepco believes these suits will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, if an unfavorable decision were rendered against Pepco, it could have a material adverse effect on Pepcos and PHIs financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Cash Balance Plan Litigation In 1999, Conectiv established a cash balance retirement plan to replace defined benefit retirement plans then maintained by ACE and DPL. Following the acquisition by Pepco of Conectiv, this plan became the Conectiv Cash Balance Sub Plan within the PHI Retirement Plan. On September 26, 2005, three management employees of PHI Service Company filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the Delaware District Court) against the PHI Retirement Plan, PHI and Conectiv (the PHI Parties), alleging violations of ERISA, on behalf of a class of management employees who did not have enough age and service when the Cash Balance Sub Plan was implemented in 1999 to assure that their accrued benefits would be calculated pursuant to the terms of the predecessor plans sponsored by ACE and DPL. A fourth plaintiff was added to the case to represent DPL heritage "grandfathered" employees who will not be eligible for early retirement at the end of the grandfathere d period. The plaintiffs have challenged the design of the Cash Balance Sub Plan and are seeking a declaratory judgment that the Cash Balance Sub Plan is invalid and that the accrued benefits of each member of the class should be calculated pursuant to the terms of the predecessor plans. Specifically, the complaint alleges that the use of a variable rate to compute the plaintiffs 93 accrued benefit under the Cash Balance Sub Plan results in reductions in the accrued benefits that violate ERISA. The complaint also alleges that the benefit accrual rates and the minimal accrual requirements of the Cash Balance Sub Plan violate ERISA as did the notice that was given to plan participants upon implementation of the Cash Balance Sub Plan. The PHI Parties filed a motion to dismiss the suit, which was denied by the court on July 11, 2006. The Delaware District Court stayed one count of the complaint regarding alleged age discrimination pending a decision in another case before the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (the Third Circuit). On January 30, 2007, the Third Circuit issued a ruling in the other case that PHIs counsel believes should result in the favorable disposition of all of the claims (other than the claim of inadequate notice) against the PHI Parties in the Delaware District Court. The PHI Parties filed pleadings apprising the Delaware District Court of the Third Circuits decision on February 16, 2007, at the same time they filed their opposition to plaintiffs motion. While PHI believes it has an increasingly strong legal position in the case and that it is therefore unlikely that the plaintiffs will prevail, PHI estimates that, if the plaintiffs were to prevail, the ABO and projected benefit obligation (PBO), calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 87, each would increase by approximately $12 million, assuming no change in benefits for persons who have already retired or whose employment has been terminated and using actuarial valuation data as of the time the suit was filed. The ABO represents the present value that participants have earned as of the date of calculation. This means that only service already worked and compensation already earned and paid is considered. The PBO is similar to the ABO, except that the PBO includes recognition of the effect that estimated future pay increases would have on the pension plan obligation. Environmental Litigation PHI, through its subsidiaries, is subject to regulation by various federal, regional, state, and local authorities with respect to the environmental effects of its operations, including air and water quality control, solid and hazardous waste disposal, and limitations on land use. In addition, federal and state statutes authorize governmental agencies to compel responsible parties to clean up certain abandoned or unremediated hazardous waste sites. PHIs subsidiaries may incur costs to clean up currently or formerly owned facilities or sites found to be contaminated, as well as other facilities or sites that may have been contaminated due to past disposal practices. Although penalties assessed for violations of environmental laws and regulations are not recoverable from customers of the operating utilities, environmental clean up costs incurred by Pepco, DPL and ACE would be included by each company in its respective cost of service for ratemaking purposes. In July 2004, DPL entered into an administrative consent order (ACO) with the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) to perform a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) to further identify the extent of soil, sediment and ground and surface water contamination related to former manufactured gas plant (MGP) operations at a Cambridge, Maryland site on DPL owned property and to investigate the extent of MGP contamination on adjacent property. The MDE has approved the RI and DPL submitted a final FS to MDE on February 15, 2007. The costs of cleanup (as determined by the RI/FS and subsequent negotiations with MDE) are anticipated to be approximately $2.7 million. The remedial action will include dredging activities within Cambridge Creek, which are expected to take place as 94 early as October 2007, and soil excavation on DPLs and adjacent property as early as January 2008. In the early 1970s, both Pepco and DPL sold scrap transformers, some of which may have contained some level of PCBs, to a metal reclaimer operating at the Metal Bank/Cottman Avenue site in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, owned by a nonaffiliated company. In December 1987, Pepco and DPL were notified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that they, along with a number of other utilities and non utilities, were PRPs in connection with the PCB contamination at the site. In 1994, an RI/FS including a number of possible remedies was submitted to the EPA. In 1997, the EPA issued a Record of Decision that set forth a selected remedial action plan with estimated implementation costs of approximately $17 million. In 1998, the EPA issued a unilateral administrative order to Pepco and 12 other PRPs directing them to conduct the design and actions called for in its decision. In May 2003, two of the potentially liable owner/operator entities filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In October 2003, the bankruptcy court confirmed a reorganization plan that incorporates the terms of a settlement among the two debtor owner/operator entities, the United States and a group of utility PRPs including Pepco (the Utility PRPs). Under the bankruptcy settlement, the reorganized entity/site owner will pay a total of $13.25 million to remediate the site (the Bankruptcy Settlement). In March 2006, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania approved global consent decrees for the Metal Bank/Cottman Avenue site, entered into on August 23, 2005, involving the Utility PRPs, the U.S. Department of Justice, EPA, The City of Philadelphia and two owner/operators of the site. Under the terms of the settlement, the two owner/operators will make payments totaling $5.55 million to the U.S. Department of Justice and totaling $4.05 million to the Utility PRPs. The Utility PRPs will perform the remedy at the site and will be able to draw on the $13.25 million from the Bankruptcy Settlement to accomplish the remediation (the Bankruptcy Funds). The Utility PRPs will contribute funds to the extent remediation costs exceed the Bankruptcy Funds available. The Utility PRPs also will be liable for EPA costs associated with overseeing the monitoring and operation of the site remedy after the remedy construction is certified to be complete and also the cost of performing the "5 year" review of site conditions required by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. Any Bankruptcy Funds not spent on the remedy may be used to cover the Utility PRPs liabilities for future costs. No parties are released from potential liability for damages to natural resources. As of December 31, 2006, Pepco had accrued $1.7 million to meet its liability for a remedy at the Metal Bank/Cottman Avenue site. While final costs to Pepco of the settlement have not been determined, Pepco believes that its liability at this site will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In 1999, DPL entered into a de minimis settlement with EPA and paid approximately $107,000 to resolve its liability for cleanup costs at the Metal Bank/Cottman Avenue site. The de minimis settlement did not resolve DPLs responsibility for natural resource damages, if any, at the site. DPL believes that any liability for natural resource damages at this site will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 95 In November 1991, the NJDEP identified ACE as a PRP at the Delilah Road Landfill site in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey. In 1993, ACE, along with other PRPs, signed an ACO with NJDEP to remediate the site. The soil cap remedy for the site has been completed and the NJDEP conditionally approved the report submitted by the parties on the implementation of the remedy in January 2003. In March 2004, NJDEP approved a Ground Water Sampling and Analysis Plan. Positive results of groundwater monitoring events have resulted in a reduced level of groundwater monitoring. In August 2006, NJDEP issued a No Further Action Letter (NFA) and Covenant Not to Sue for the site. Among other things, the NFA requires the PRPs to monitor the effectiveness of institutional (deed restriction) and engineering (cap) controls at the site every two years and to continue groundwater monitoring. In March 2003, EPA demanded from the PRP group reimbursement for EPAs past costs at the site, totaling $168,789. The PRP group objected to the demand for certain costs, but agreed to reimburse EPA approximately $19,000. Based on information currently available, ACE anticipates that its share of additional cost associated with this site will be approximately $555,000 to $600,000. ACE believes that its liability for post remedy operation and maintenance costs will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. On January 24, 2006, PHI, Conectiv and ACE entered into an ACO with NJDEP and the Attorney General of New Jersey resolving (i) New Jerseys claim for alleged violations of the federal Clean Air Act (CAA) and (ii) the NJDEPs concerns regarding ACEs compliance with New Source Review requirements of the CAA and Air Pollution Control Act requirements with respect to the B.L. England generating facility and various other environmental issues relating to ACE and Conectiv Energy facilities in New Jersey. See Item 1 "Business Environmental Matters Air Quality Regulation." Federal Tax Treatment of Cross Border Leases PCI maintains a portfolio of cross border energy sale leaseback transactions, which, as of December 31, 2006, had a book value of approximately $1.3 billion, and from which PHI currently derives approximately $57 million per year in tax benefits in the form of interest and depreciation deductions. On February 11, 2005, the Treasury Department and IRS issued Notice 2005 13 informing taxpayers that the IRS intends to challenge on various grounds the purported tax benefits claimed by taxpayers entering into certain sale leaseback transactions with tax indifferent parties (i.e., municipalities, tax exempt and governmental entities), including those entered into on or prior to March 12, 2004 (the Notice). All of PCIs cross border energy leases are with tax indifferent parties and were entered into prior to 2004. In addition, on June 29, 2005 the IRS published a Coordinated Issue Paper concerning the resolution of audit issues related to such transactions. PCIs cross border energy leases are similar to those sale leaseback transactions described in the Notice and the Coordinated Issue Paper. PCIs leases have been under examination by the IRS as part of the normal PHI tax audit. On June 9, 2006, the IRS issued its final revenue agents report (RAR) for its audit of PHIs 2001 and 2002 income tax returns. In the RAR, the IRS disallowed the tax benefits claimed by PHI with respect to these leases for those years. The tax benefits claimed by PHI with respect to these leases from 2001 through December 31, 2006 were approximately $287 million. PHI has filed a protest against the IRS adjustments and the unresolved audit has been forwarded to the Appeals Office. The ultimate outcome of this issue is uncertain; however, if the IRS prevails, PHI would be subject to additional taxes, along with interest and possibly penalties on the 96 additional taxes, which could have a material adverse effect on PHIs financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. PHI believes that its tax position related to these transactions was appropriate based on applicable statutes, regulations and case law, and intends to contest the adjustments proposed by the IRS; however, there is no assurance that PHIs position will prevail. On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) on Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) 13 2, which amends SFAS No. 13 effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. This amendment requires a lease to be repriced and the book value adjusted when there is a change or probable change in the timing of tax benefits of the lease regardless of whether the change results in a deferral or permanent loss of tax benefits. Accordingly, a material change in the timing of cash flows under PHIs cross border leases as the result of a settlement with the IRS would require an adjustment to the book value of the leases and a charge to earnings equal to the repricing impact of the disallowed deductions which could result in a material adverse effect on PHIs financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. PHI believes its tax position was appropriate and at this time does not believe there is a probable change in the timing of its tax benefits that would require repricing the leases and a charge to earnings. On February 1, 2007 the U.S. Senate passed the Small Business and Work Opportunity Act of 2007. Included in this legislation is a provision which would apply passive loss limitation rules to leases with foreign tax indifferent parties effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006, even if the leases were entered into on or prior to March 12, 2004. On February 16, 2007, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Small Business Relief Act of 2007. This bill does not include any provision that would modify the current treatment of leases with tax indifferent parties. Enactment into law of a bill that is similar to that passed by the U.S. Senate in its current form could result in a material delay of the income tax benefits that PCI would receive in connection with its cross border energy leases. Furthermore, under FSP FAS 13 2, PHI would be required to adjust the book values of its leases and record a charge to earnings equal to the repricing impact of th e disallowed deductions which could result in a material adverse effect on PHIs financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate are expected to hold a conference in the near future to reconcile the differences in the two bills to determine the final legislation. IRS Mixed Service Cost Issue During 2001, Pepco, DPL, and ACE changed their methods of accounting with respect to capitalizable construction costs for income tax purposes. The change allowed the companies to accelerate the deduction of certain expenses that were previously capitalized and depreciated. Through December 31, 2005, these accelerated deductions generated incremental tax cash flow benefits of approximately $205 million (consisting of $94 million for Pepco, $62 million for DPL, and $49 million for ACE) for the companies, primarily attributable to their 2001 tax returns. On August 2, 2005, the Treasury Department released regulations that, if adopted in their current form, would require Pepco, DPL, and ACE to change their method of accounting with respect to capitalizable construction costs for income tax purposes for tax periods beginning in 2005. Based on those regulations, PHI in its 2005 federal tax return adopted an alternative method of accounting for capitalizable construction costs that management believes will be acceptable to the IRS. 97 On the same day that the new regulations were released, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 2005 53, which is intended to limit the ability of certain taxpayers to utilize the method of accounting for income tax purposes they utilized on their tax returns for 2004 and prior years with respect to capitalizable construction costs. In line with this Revenue Ruling, the IRS RAR for the 2001 and 2002 tax returns disallowed substantially all of the incremental tax benefits that Pepco, DPL and ACE had claimed on those returns by requiring the companies to capitalize and depreciate certain expenses rather than treat such expenses as current deductions. PHIs protest of the IRS adjustments is among the unresolved audit matters relating to the 2001 and 2002 audits pending before the Appeals Office. In February 2006, PHI paid approximately $121 million of taxes to cover the amount of taxes that management estimated to be payable based on the method of tax accounting that PHI, pursuant to the proposed regulations, has adopted on its 2005 tax return. However, if the IRS is successful in requiring Pepco, DPL and ACE to capitalize and depreciate construction costs that result in a tax and interest assessment greater than managements estimate of $121 million, PHI will be required to pay additional taxes and interest only to the extent these adjustments exceed the $121 million payment made in February 2006. IRS Examination of Like Kind Exchange Transaction In 2001, Conectiv and certain of its subsidiaries (the Conectiv Group) were divesting nonstrategic electric generating facilities and replacing these facilities with mid merit electric generating capacity. As part of this strategy, the Conectiv Group exchanged its interests in two older coal fired plants for the more efficient gas fired Hay Road II generating facility, which was owned by an unaffiliated third party. For tax purposes, Conectiv treated the transaction as a "like kind exchange" under IRC Section 1031. As a result, approximately $88 million of taxable gain was deferred for federal income tax purposes. The transaction was examined by the IRS as part of the normal Conectiv tax audit. In May 2006, the IRS issued its RAR for the audit of Conectivs 2000, 2001 and 2002 income tax returns. In the RAR, the IRS exam team disallowed the qualification of the exchange under IRC Section 1031. In July 2006, Conectiv filed a protest of this disallowance to the IRS Office of Appeals. PHI believes that its tax position related to this transaction is proper based on applicable statutes, regulations and case law and intends to vigorously contest the disallowance. However, there is no absolute assurance that Conectivs position will prevail. If the IRS prevails, Conectiv would be subject to additional income taxes, interest and possible penalties. However, a portion of the denied benefit would be offset by additional tax depreciation. As of December 31, 2006, if the IRS fully prevails, the potential cash impact on PHI would be current income tax and interest payments of approximately $29 million and the earnings impact would be approximately $7 million in after tax interest. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES General The SEC has defined a companys most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to 98 make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates represent those estimates and assumptions that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and that have a material impact on financial condition or operating performance. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, such as Statement of Position 94 6, "Disclosure of Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties," requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Examples of significant estimates used by Pepco Holdings include the assessment of contingencies and the need/amount for reserves of future receipts from Mirant (see "Relationship with Mirant Corporation"), the calculation of future cash flows and fair value amounts for use in goodwill and asset impairment evaluations, fair value calculations (based on estimated market pricing) associated with derivative instruments, pension and other postretirement benefits assumptions, unbilled revenue calculations, and the judgment involved with assessing the probability of recovery of regulatory assets. Additionally, PHI is subject to legal, regulatory, and other proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Pepco Holdings records an estimated liability for these proceedings and claims based upon the probable and reasonably estimable criteria contained in SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies." Although Pepco Holdings believes that its estimates and assu mptions are reasonable, they are based upon information available to management at the time the estimates are made. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Goodwill Impairment Evaluation Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in its goodwill impairment evaluation process represent "Critical Accounting Estimates" because (i) they may be susceptible to change from period to period because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about the discounting of future cash flows, which are inherently uncertain, (ii) actual results could vary from those used in Pepco Holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material, and (iii) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on Pepco Holdings assets and the net loss related to an impairment charge could be material. The provisions of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," require the evaluation of goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. SFAS No. 142 indicates that if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill, an impairment charge may be necessary. The goodwill generated in the transaction by which Pepco acquired Conectiv in 2002 was allocated to Pepco Holdings Power Delivery segment. In order to estimate the fair value of its Power Delivery segment, Pepco Holdings discounts the estimated future cash flows associated with the segment using a discounted cash flow model with a single interest rate that is commensurate with the risk involved with such an investment. The estimation of fair value is dependent on a number of factors, including but not limited to interest rates, future growth assumptions, operating and capital expenditu re requirements and other factors, changes in which could materially impact the results of impairment testing. Pepco Holdings tested its goodwill for 99 impairment as of July 1, 2006. This testing concluded that Pepco Holdings goodwill balance was not impaired. A hypothetical decrease in the Power Delivery segments forecasted cash flows of 10 percent would not have resulted in an impairment charge. Long Lived Assets Impairment Evaluation Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in its long lived asset impairment evaluation process represent "Critical Accounting Estimates" because (i) they are highly susceptible to change from period to period because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about undiscounted and discounted future cash flows and fair values, which are inherently uncertain, (ii) actual results could vary from those used in Pepco Holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material, and (iii) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on Pepco Holdings assets as well as the net loss related to an impairment charge could be material. SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," requires that certain long lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss may only be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. The asset is deemed not to be recoverable when its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. In order to estimate an assets future cash flows, Pepco Holdings considers historical cash flows. Pepco Holdings uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel costs, legislative initiatives, and operating costs. The process of determining fair value is done consistent with the process described in assessing the fair val ue of goodwill, which is discussed above. For a discussion of PHIs impairment losses during 2006, refer to the "Impairment Losses" section in the accompanying Consolidated Results of Operations discussion. Derivative Instruments Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in accounting for its derivative instruments represent "Critical Accounting Estimates" because (i) the fair value of the instruments are highly susceptible to changes in market value and or interest rate fluctuations, (ii) there are significant uncertainties in modeling techniques used to measure fair value in certain circumstances, (iii) actual results could vary from those used in Pepco Holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material, and (iv) changes in fair values and market prices could result in material impacts to Pepco Holdings assets, liabilities, other comprehensive income (loss), and results of operations. See Note (2), "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting for Derivatives" to the consolidated financial statements of PHI included in Item 8 for information on PHIs accounting for derivatives. Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments primarily to manage risk associated with commodity prices and interest rates. SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended, governs the accounting treatment for derivatives and requires that derivative instruments be measured at fair value. The fair value of derivatives is determined using quoted exchange prices where available. For instruments that are not traded on an exchange, external broker quotes are used to determine fair value. For some 100 custom and complex instruments, an internal model is used to interpolate broker quality price information. The same valuation methods are used to determine the value of non derivative, commodity exposure for risk management purposes. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in reporting the costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefits represent "Critical Accounting Estimates" because (i) they are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of assumptions which are subjective in nature, (ii) they are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience, and (iii) changes in assumptions could impact Pepco Holdings expected future cash funding requirements for the plans and would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations, the reported pension and other postretirement benefit liability on the balance sheet, and the reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost on the income statement. In terms of quantifying the anticipated impact of a change in assumptions, Pepco Holdings estimates that a .25% change in the discount rate used to value the benefit obligations could result in a $ 5 million impact on its consolidated balance sheets and statements of earnings. Additionally, Pepco Holdings estimates that a .25% change in the expected return on plan assets could result in a $4 million impact on the consolidated balance sheets and statements of earnings and a .25% change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate could result in a $.5 million impact on its consolidated balance sheets and statements of earnings. Pepco Holdings management consults with its actuaries and investment consultants when selecting its plan assumptions. Pepco Holdings follows the guidance of SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," and SFAS No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)" (SFAS No. 158), when accounting for these benefits. Under these accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. In accordance with these standards, the impact of changes in these assumptions and the difference between actual and expected or estimated results on pension and postretirement obligations is generally recognized over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans rather than immediately recognized in the statements of earnings. Plan assets are stated at their market value as of the measurement date, which is December 31. Regulation of Power Delivery Operations The requirements of SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," apply to the Power Delivery businesses of Pepco, DPL, and ACE. Pepco Holdings believes that the judgment involved in accounting for its regulated activities represent "Critical Accounting Estimates" because (i) a significant amount of judgment is required (including but not limited to the interpretation of laws and regulatory commission orders) to assess the probability of the recovery of regulatory assets, (ii) actual results and interpretations could vary from those used in Pepco Holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material, and (iii) the impact that writing off a regulatory asset would have on Pepco Holdings assets and the net loss related to the charge could be material. 101 Unbilled Revenue Unbilled revenue represents an estimate of revenue earned from services rendered by Pepco Holdings utility operations that have not yet been billed. Pepco Holdings utility operations calculate unbilled revenue using an output based methodology. This methodology is based on the supply of electricity or gas distributed to customers. Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in its unbilled revenue process represent "Critical Accounting Estimates" because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about input factors such as customer sales mix and estimated power line losses (estimates of electricity expected to be lost in the process of its transmission and distribution to customers), all of which are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change from period to period, the impact of which could be material. New Accounting Standards FSP FTB 85 4 1, "Accounting for Life Settlement Contracts by Third Party Investors" In March 2006, the FASB issued FSP FASB Technical Bulletin (FTB) 85 4 1, "Accounting for Life Settlement Contracts by Third Party Investors" (FSP FTB 85 4 1). This FSP provides initial and subsequent measurement guidance and financial statement presentation and disclosure guidance for investments by third party investors in life settlement contracts. FSP FTB 85 4 1 also amends certain provisions of FASB Technical Bulletin No. 85 4, "Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance," and SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." The guidance in FSP FTB 85 4 1 applies prospectively for all new life settlement contracts and is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2006 (the year ending December 31, 2007 for Pepco Holdings). Pepco Holdings has evaluated the impact of FSP FTB 85 4 1 and does not anticipate its adoption will have a material impact on its overall financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. EITF 04 13, "Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty" In September 2005, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 04 13, "Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty" (EITF 04 13), which addresses circumstances under which two or more exchange transactions involving inventory with the same counterparty should be viewed as a single exchange transaction for the purposes of evaluating the effect of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion 29, "Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions." EITF 04 13 is effective for new arrangements entered into, or modifications or renewals of existing arrangements, beginning in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after March 15, 2006. Pepco Holdings implemented EITF 04 13 on April 1, 2006. The implementation did not have a material impact on Pepco Holdings overall financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows for the second quarter of 2006. SFAS No. 155, "Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140" In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, "Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140" (SFAS No. 155). SFAS No. 155 amends FASB Statements No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," and No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities." SFAS No. 155 resolves issues addressed in Statement 133 102 Implementation Issue No. D1, "Application of Statement 133 to Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets." SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006 (year ending December 31, 2007 for Pepco Holdings). Pepco Holdings has evaluated the impact of SFAS No. 155 and does not anticipate that its implementation will have a material impact on its overall financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. SFAS No. 156, "Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140" In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, "Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets" (SFAS No. 156), an amendment of SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities," with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. SFAS No. 156 requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset or servicing liability upon undertaking an obligation to service a financial asset via certain servicing contracts, and for all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities to be initially measured at fair value, if practicable. Subsequent measurement is permitted using either the amortization method or the fair value measurement method for each class of separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. SFAS No. 156 is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006 (year ending December 31, 2007 for Pepco Holdings). Application is to be applied prospectively to all transactions following adoption of SFAS No. 156. Pepco Holdings has evaluated the impact of SFAS No. 156 and does not anticipate its adoption will have a material impact on its overall financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. FSP FIN 46(R) 6, "Determining the Variability to Be Considered in Applying FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)" In April 2006, the FASB issued FSP FASB Interpretation Number (FIN) 46(R) 6, "Determining the Variability to Be Considered in Applying FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)" (FSP FIN 46(R) 6), which provides guidance on how to determine the variability to be considered in applying FIN 46(R), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." The guidance in FSP FIN 46(R) 6 is applicable prospectively beginning the first day of the first reporting period beginning after June 15, 2006. Pepco Holdings started applying the guidance in FSP FIN 46(R) 6 to new and modified arrangements effective July 1, 2006. EITF Issue No. 06 3, "Disclosure Requirements for Taxes Assessed by a Governmental Authority on Revenue producing Transactions" On June 28, 2006, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 06 3, "Disclosure Requirements for Taxes Assessed by a Governmental Authority on Revenue producing Transactions" (EITF 06 3). EITF 06 3 provides guidance on an entitys disclosure of its accounting policy regarding the gross or net presentation of certain taxes and provides that if taxes included in gross revenues are significant, a company should disclose the amount of such taxes for each period for which an income statement is presented (i.e., both interim and annual periods). Taxes within the scope of EITF 06 3 are those that are imposed on and concurrent with a specific 103 revenue producing transaction. Taxes assessed on an entitys activities over a period of time are not within the scope of EITF 06 3. EITF 06 3 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2006 (March 31, 2007 for Pepco Holdings) although earlier application is permitted. Pepco Holdings does not anticipate that the adoption of EITF 06 3 will materially impact its disclosure requirements. FSP FAS 13 2, "Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction" On July 13, 2006, the FASB issued FSP FAS 13 2, "Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction" (FSP FAS 13 2). FSP FAS 13 2, which amends SFAS No. 13, "Accounting for Leases," addresses how a change or projected change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction affects the accounting by a lessor for that lease. FSP FAS 13 2 will not be effective until the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006 (year ending December 31, 2007 for Pepco Holdings). A material change in the timing of cash flows under PHIs cross border leases as the result of a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service or a change in tax law would require an adjustment to the book value of the leases and a charge to earnings equal to the repricing impact of the disallowed deductions which could result in a material adverse effect on PHIs financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. FIN 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" On July 13, 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the criteria for recognition of tax benefits in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," and prescribes a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Specifically, it clarifies that an entitys tax benefits must be "more likely than not" of being sustained prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements. If the position drops below the "more likely than not" standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006 (year ending December 31, 2007 for Pepco Holdings). Pepco Holdings has completed its evaluation of FIN 48, which resulted in an immaterial impact to its retained earnings at January 1, 2007, and no impact on its results of operations and cash flows. SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" (SFAS No. 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and does not require any new fair value measurements. However, it is possible that the application of this Statement 104 will change current practice with respect to the definition of fair value, the methods used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years (year ending December 31, 2008 for Pepco Holdings). Pepco Holdings is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 157 on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. FSP AUG AIR 1, "Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities" On September 8, 2006, the FASB issued FSP AUG AIR 1, which prohibits the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities in annual and interim financial reporting periods. FSP AUG AIR 1 is effective the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006 (year ending December 31, 2007 for Pepco Holdings). Pepco Holdings does not believe that the implementation of FSP AUG AIR 1 will have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. "Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108" On September 13, 2006, the SEC issued SAB No. 108 (SAB 108) which expresses the SEC staffs views on the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements. SAB 108 requires that registrants quantify the impact of correcting all misstatements, including both the carryover and reversing effects of prior year misstatements, on the current year financial statements by quantifying an error using both the rollover and iron curtain approaches and by evaluating the error measured under each approach. Under SAB 108, a registrants financial statements would require adjustment when either approach results in a material misstatement, after considering all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. Further, the SEC believes that a registrants materiality assessment of an identified unadjusted error should quantify the effects of the identified unadjusted error on each financial statement and related financial statement disclosure. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years endi ng on or after November 15, 2006. Pepco Holdings implemented the guidance provided in SAB 108 during the year ended December 31, 2006. EITF Issue No. 06 5, "Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance Determining the Amount That Could Be Realized in Accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin No. 85 4, Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance" On September 20, 2006, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 06 5, "Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance Determining the Amount That Could Be Realized in Accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin No. 85 4, Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance" (EITF 06 5) which provides guidance on whether an entity should consider the contractual ability to surrender all of the individual life policies (or certificates under a group life policy) together when determining the amount that could be realized in accordance with FTB 85 4, and whether a guarantee of the additional value associated with the group life policy affects that determination. EITF 06 5 provides that a policyholder should (i) determine the amount that could be realized under the insurance contract assuming the surrender of an individual life by individual life policy (or certificate by certificate in a group policy) and (ii) not discount the cash surrender value component of the amount that could be realized when c ontractual restrictions on the ability to 105 surrender a policy exist unless contractual limitations prescribe that the cash surrender value component of the amount that could be realized is a fixed amount, in which case the amount that could be realized should be discounted in accordance with Opinion 21. EITF 06 5 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 (year ending December 31, 2007 for Pepco Holdings). Pepco Holdings does not anticipate that the adoption of EITF 06 5 will materially impact its disclosure requirements. FASB Staff Position No. EITF 00 19 2, "Accounting for Registration Payment Arrangements" On December 21, 2006, the FASB issued FSP No. EITF 00 19 2, "Accounting for Registration Payment Arrangements" (FSP EITF 00 19 2), which addresses an issuers accounting for registration payment arrangements and specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment arrangement, whether issued as a separate agreement or included as a provision of a financial instrument or other agreement, should be separately recognized and measured in accordance with FASB SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies." FSP EITF 00 19 2 is effective immediately for registration payment arrangements and the financial instruments subject to those arrangements that are entered into or modified subsequent to the date of its issuance. For registration payment arrangements and financial instruments subject to those arrangements that were entered into prior to the issuance of FSP EITF 00 19 2, this guidance shall be effe ctive for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, and interim periods within those fiscal years (December 31, 2007 for Pepco Holdings). Pepco Holdings is evaluating the impact, if any, of FSP EITF 00 19 2 and does not anticipate its adoption will have a material impact on its overall financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115" On February 15, 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115" (SFAS No. 159) which permits entities to choose to elect to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value. The objective of SFAS No. 159 is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS No. 159 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and does not require any new fair value measurements. However, it is possible that the application of SFAS No. 159 will change current practice with respect to the definition of fair value, the methods used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No.159 establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of the companys choice to use fair value on its earnings. It also requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair 106 value on the face of the balance sheet. SFAS No. 159 does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards. SFAS No. 159 applies to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 (year ending December 31, 2008 for Pepco Holdings), with early adoption permitted for an entity that has also elected to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. An entity is prohibited from retrospectively applying SFAS No. 159, unless it chooses early adoption. SFAS No. 159 also applies to eligible items existing at November 15, 2007 (or early adoption date). Pepco Holdings is in the process of evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 159 on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Pepco provides Default Electricity Supply, which is the supply of electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its territories who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive supplier, in both the District of Columbia and Maryland. Default Electricity Supply is known as Standard Offer Service (SOS) in both the District of Columbia and Maryland. Pepcos service territory covers approximately 640 square miles and has a population of approximately 2.1 million. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 57% of delivered electricity sales were to Maryland customers and approximately 43% were to Washington, D.C. customers. Pepco is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI or Pepco Holdings). Because PHI is a public utility holding company subject to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005), the relationship between PHI and Pepco and certain activities of Pepco are subject to the regulatory oversight of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under PUHCA 2005.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, Pepcos Maryland customers served by Pepco represented 60% of Pepcos total Maryland sales, and Pepcos District of Columbia customers served by Pepco represented 57% of Pepcos total District of Columbia sales. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Pepcos Maryland customers served by Pepco represented 62% of Pepcos total Maryland sales, and Pepcos District of Columbia customers served by Pepco represented 41% of Pepcos total District of Columbia sales. Operating Expenses Fuel and Purchased Energy Fuel and Purchased Energy associated with Default Electricity Supply sales increased by $386.0 million to $1,299.7 million in 2006, from $913.7 million in 2005. The increase is primarily due to: (i) $337.3 million increase in average energy costs, the result of new supply contracts in June 2006 and 2005, (ii) $116.4 million increase due to increased Default Electricity Supply load in 2006, partially offset by (iii) $69.5 million decrease in sales and rate variances, primarily due to weather and customer usage (partially offset in Default Supply Revenue). Other Operation and Maintenance Other Operation and Maintenance expenses decreased by $3.0 million to $277.3 million in 2006, from $280.3 million in 2005. The decrease was primarily due to the following: (i) $7.0 million decrease in legal expenses primarily related to Mirant Corporation and its predecessors and its subsidiaries (Mirant), (ii) $5.6 million decrease in corporate allocations, (iii) $3.9 million decrease due to a write off of software in 2005, offset by (iv) $5.2 million increase in Default 112 Electricity Supply costs (partially deferred and recoverable), (v) $4.9 million increase due to the 2005 Mirant uncollectible reserve reduction, and (vi) $4.0 million increase in information technology business systems costs. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and Amortization expenses increased by $4.4 million to $166.2 million in 2006, from $161.8 million in 2005 primarily due to plant additions. Other Taxes Other Taxes decreased by $3.0 million to $273.1 million in 2006, from $276.1 million in 2005. The decrease was primarily due to (i) $7.2 million decrease due to lower pass throughs, resulting from lower Gwh sales (partially offset in Regulated T&D Revenue), partially offset by (ii) a $4.8 million District of Columbia delivery tax adjustment that corrected amounts that were previously recorded. Gain on Sales of Assets The Gain on Sales of Assets of $72.4 million in 2005 primarily resulted from a $68.1 million gain from the sale of non utility land located at Buzzard Point in the District of Columbia. Gain on Settlement of Claims with Mirant The Gain on Settlement of Claims with Mirant of $70.5 million in 2005 represents a settlement (net of customer sharing) with Mirant of Pepcos $105 million allowed, pre petition general unsecured claim against Mirant ($70 million gain) and a Pepco asbestos claim against the Mirant bankruptcy estate ($.5 million gain). See "Regulatory and Other Matters Relationship with Mirant Corporation" for additional information. Other Income (Expenses) Other Expenses decreased by $6.3 million to a net expense of $57.4 million in 2006, from a net expense of $63.7 million in 2005. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense resulting from debt maturities. Income Tax Expense Pepcos effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 40% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference were state income taxes (net of federal benefit) and the flow through of certain book tax depreciation and amortization differences, partially offset by the flow through of tax credits and the flow through of certain asset removal costs. Pepcos effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 44% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference were state income taxes (net of federal benefit), the flow through of certain book tax depreciation and amortization differences, and changes in estimates related to tax liabilities of prior tax years subject to audit (primarily due to the mixed service costs issued under Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 2005 53), partially offset by the flow through of tax credits. 113 FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Some of the statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are subject to the safe harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Other Gas Revenue Other Gas Revenue decreased by $12.2 million to $50.6 million in 2006 from $62.8 million in 2005 primarily due to lower off system sales (partially offset in Gas Purchased expense). Operating Expenses Fuel and Purchased Energy Fuel and Purchased Energy associated with Default Electricity Supply sales increased by $118.8 million to $816.8 million in 2006 from $698.0 million in 2005. The increase is primarily due to the following: (i) $288.4 million increase in average energy costs, the result of higher cost supply contracts in Maryland in June 2006 and 2005, in Delaware beginning in May 2006 and in Virginia in June 2006, offset by (ii) $105.4 million decrease due to lower Default Electricity Supply sales in 2006, and (iii) $45.3 million decrease in sales and rate variances, primarily due to weather and customer usage. 120 Gas Purchased Total Gas Purchased increased by $1.6 million to $198.4 million in 2006, from $196.8 million in 2005. The increase is primarily due to the following: (i) $26.3 million increase from the settlement of financial hedges (entered into as part of DPLs regulated natural gas hedge program), (ii) $12.0 million increase in deferred fuel costs, offset by (iii) $27.1 million decrease in sales primarily due to weather and customer usage, and (iv) $9.6 million decrease in costs associated with lower off system sales (offset in Regulated Gas Revenue and Other Gas Revenue). Other Operation and Maintenance Other Operation and Maintenance expenses increased by $4.8 million to $184.9 million in 2006 from $180.1 million in 2005. This increase was primarily due to (i) $4.6 million increase in maintenance and restoration expenses, (ii) $3.2 million increase in Default Electricity Supply costs (partially deferred and recoverable), (iii) $2.3 million increase primarily due to the accrual for a Cambridge, Maryland environmental coal gas liability, partially offset by (iv) $2.8 million decrease in costs related to customer requested work, and (v) $1.9 million decrease in the uncollectible reserve due to a change in estimate. Other Taxes Other Taxes increased by $2.2 million to $36.6 million in 2006 from $34.4 million in 2005. The increase was primarily due to a $2.0 million increase in property taxes due to higher assessments. Gain on Sales of Assets The Gain on Sales of Assets was $1.5 million in 2006, compared to $3.6 million in 2005. The gain in 2005 primarily resulted from the sale of non utility land. Other Income and Expenses Other Expenses (which are net of other income) increased by $6.8 million to a net expense of $36.9 million in 2006 from a net expense of $30.1 million in 2005. The increase primarily related to an increase in interest expense on short term debt. Income Tax Expense DPLs effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 43% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference were state income taxes (net of federal benefit), changes in estimates related to tax liabilities of prior tax years subject to audit, and the flow through of certain book tax depreciation differences, partially offset by the flow through of deferred investment tax credits. DPLs effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 43% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%.

ACE provides Default Electricity Supply, which is the supply of electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territory who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive supplier. Default Electricity Supply is also known as Basic Generation Service (BGS) in New Jersey. ACEs service territory covers approximately 2,700 square miles and has a population of approximately 1.0 million. ACE is a wholly owned subsidiary of Conectiv, which is wholly owned by Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI or Pepco Holdings). Because PHI is a public utility holding company subject to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005), the relationship between PHI and ACE and certain activities of ACE are subject to the regulatory oversight of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under PUHCA 2005. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In May 2005, ACE announced that it would auction its electric generation assets, consisting of its ownership interests in the Keystone and Conemaugh generating facilities and its B.L. England generating facility. On September 1, 2006, ACE completed the sale of its interests in the Keystone and Conemaugh generating facilities to Duquesne Light Holdings Inc. for approximately $177.0 million, which was subsequently decreased by $1.6 million based on a post closing 60 day true up for applicable items not known at the time of closing. Approximately $81.3 million of the net gain from the sale has been used to offset the remaining regulatory asset balance, which ACE has been recovering in rates, and approximately $49.8 million of the net gain is being returned to ratepayers over a 33 month period as a credit on their bills, which began during the October 2006 billing period. The balance to be repaid to customers is $48.4 million as of December 31, 2006. Additionally, on February 8, 2007, ACE completed the sale of the B.L. England generating facility to RC Cape May Holdings, LLC, an affiliate of Rockland Capital Energy Investments, LLC (RC Cape May), for a price of $9.0 million, after adjustment for, among other things, variances in the value of fuel and material inventories at the time of closing, plant operating capacity, the value of certain benefits for transferred employees and the actual closing date. The purchase price will be further adjusted based on a post closing 60 day true up for applicable items not known at the time of the closing. In addition, RC Cape May and ACE have agreed to arbitration concerning whether RC Cape May must pay to ACE, as part of the purchase price, an additional $3.1 million remaining in dispute. RC Cape May also assumed certain liabilities associated with the B.L. England generating station, including substantially all environmental liabilities. Not included in the sale are certain sulf ur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) allowances, including those covered by the administrative consent order (ACO) entered into by ACE on January 24, 2006, as described in Item 1 "Business Environmental Matters Air Quality Regulation." On October 31, 2006, ACE, RC Cape May and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) signed an amendment to the ACO, pursuant 125 to which RC Cape May assumed from ACE, upon closing of the sale, certain obligations under the ACO with respect to the B. L. England facility. In addition, among other conditions, the sale required the entry by RC Cape May into a remediation agreement with NJDEP and NJDEP approval of the transfer of certain environmental permits from ACE to the buyer. The sale of B.L. England will not affect the stranded costs associated with the plant that already have been securitized. ACE anticipates that approximately $9 million to $10 million of additional regulatory assets related to B.L. England may, subject to New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) approval, be eligible for recovery as stranded costs. The emission allowance credits associated with B. L. England will be monetized for the benefit of ACEs ratepayers pursuant to the NJBPU order approving the sale. Net proceeds from the sale of the plant and monetization of the emission allowance credits, which will be determined after the sale upon resolution of certain adjustments, will be credited to ACEs ratepayers in accordance with the requirements of the New Jersey Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act and NJBPU orders. B.L. England comprised a significant component of ACEs generation operations and its potential sale required "discontinued operations" presentation under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," on ACEs Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004. The operations of Keystone and Conemaugh are also reflected as "discontinued operations" for each period presented. Additionally, B.L. Englands assets and liabilities are reflected as "held for sale" on ACEs Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2006. The following table summarizes information related to the discontinued operations for the years presented (millions of dollars): 2006 2005 2004 Operating Revenue $113.7 $170.3 $119.9 Income Before Income Tax Expense and Extraordinary Item $ 4.4 $ 5.2 $ 4.8 Net Income $ 2.6 $ 3.1 $ 2.9 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following results of operations discussion is for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Other than this disclosure, information under this item has been omitted in accordance with General Instruction I(2)(a) to the Form 10 K. All amounts in the tables (except sales and customers) are in millions of dollars. Operating Revenue 2006 2005 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 345.6 $ 355.2 $ (9.6) Default Supply Revenue 1,014.0 976.7 37.3 Other Electric Revenue 13.7 18.2 (4.5) Total Operating Revenue $ 1,373.3 $ 1,350.1 $ 23.2 126 The table above shows the amount of Operating Revenue earned that is subject to price regulation (Regulated Transmission and Distribution (T&D) Electric Revenue and Default Supply Revenue) and that which is not subject to price regulation (Other Electric Revenue). Regulated T&D Electric Revenue consists of the revenue ACE receives for delivery of electricity to its customers for which service ACE is paid regulated rates. Default Supply Revenue is the revenue received by ACE for providing Default Electricity Supply. The costs related to the supply of electricity are included in Fuel and Purchased Energy expense. Also included in Default Supply Revenue is revenue from non utility generators (NUGs), transition bond charges (TBC), market transition charges and other restructuring related revenues (see Deferred Electric Service Costs). Other Electric Revenue includes revenue for work and services performed on behalf of customers including other utilities that is not s ubject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rents, late payments, and collection fees. Regulated T&D Electric Regulated T&D Electric Revenue 2006 2005 Change Residential $ 168.5 $ 175.8 $ (7.3) Commercial 107.2 108.5 (1.3) Industrial 15.1 16.1 (1.0) Other (Includes PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM)) 54.8 54.8 Total Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 345.6 $ 355.2 $ (9.6) Regulated T&D Electric Sales (gigawatt hours (Gwh)) 2006 2005 Change Residential 4,275 4,444 (169) Commercial 4,389 4,366 23 Industrial 1,220 1,224 (4) Other 47 46 1 Total Regulated T&D Electric Sales 9,931 10,080 (149) Regulated T&D Electric Customers (000s) 2006 2005 Change Residential 474 468 6 Commercial 63 62 1 Industrial 1 1 Other 1 1 Total Regulated T&D Electric Customers 539 532 7 Regulated T&D Electric Revenue decreased by $9.6 million primarily due to the following: (i) $11.9 million decrease due to lower weather related sales, the result of a 17% decrease in Heating Degree Days and 12% decrease in Cooling Degree Days in 2006, and (ii) $4.9 million decrease due to differences in consumption among the various customer rate classes, partially offset by (iii) $4.0 million increase due to an adjustment for estimated unbilled revenue in the second quarter 2005, primarily reflecting higher estimated power line losses, and (iv) $3.4 million increase due to customer growth of 1.3%. 127 Default Electricity Supply Default Supply Revenue 2006 2005 Change Residential $ 420.5 $ 367.8 $ 52.7 Commercial 333.8 278.7 55.1 Industrial 52.8 46.2 6.6 Other (Includes PJM) 206.9 284.0 (77.1) Total Default Supply Revenue $ 1,014.0 $ 976.7 $ 37.3 Default Electricity Supply Sales (Gwh) 2006 2005 Change Residential 4,275 4,456 (181) Commercial 3,167 3,028 139 Industrial 396 338 58 Other 47 46 1 Total Default Electricity Supply Sales 7,885 7,868 17 Default Electricity Supply Customers (000s) 2006 2005 Change Residential 474 467 7 Commercial 63 62 1 Industrial 1 1 Other 1 1 Total Default Electricity Supply Customers 539 531 8 Default Supply Revenue increased by $37.3 million primarily due to the following: (i) $114.1 million in higher retail energy rates, primarily resulting from new market based BGS increases in New Jersey (partially offset in Fuel and Purchased Energy expense), (ii) $10.8 million increase due to higher Default Electricity Supply sales in 2006, (iii) $8.9 million increase in sales due to customer growth, the result of a 1.5% increase in 2006, (iv) $7.9 million increase due to an adjustment for estimated unbilled revenue in the second quarter 2005, primarily reflecting higher estimated power line losses, partially offset by (v) $85.5 million decrease in wholesale energy revenues from sales of generated and purchased energy (included in Other) due to lower market prices and lower sales in 2006, and (vi) $23.6 million decrease due to weather related sales, the result of a 17% decrease in Heating Degree Days and 12% decrease in Cooling Degree Days in 2006. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, ACEs customers served energy by ACE represented 78% of ACEs total sales. Operating Expenses Fuel and Purchased Energy Fuel and Purchased Energy associated with Default Electricity Supply sales increased by $73.3 million to $924.2 million in 2006, from $850.9 million in 2005. This increase is primarily due to (i) $111.1 million increase in average energy costs, the result of higher cost supply contracts in June 2006 and 2005, partially offset by (ii) $34.8 million decrease in other sales and 128 rate variances primarily due to weather and customer usage (partially offset in Default Supply Revenue). Other Operation and Maintenance Other Operation and Maintenance expenses decreased by $6.8 million to $147.7 million in 2006 from $154.5 million in 2005. The decrease was primarily due to a $3.2 million decrease in corporate allocations and a $2.9 million decrease due to a workers compensation adjustment. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and Amortization expenses decreased by $10.9 million to $111.3 million in 2006, from $122.2 million in 2005. The decrease is primarily due to (i) $7.7 million lower depreciation due to a change in depreciation technique and rates resulting from a 2005 final rate order issued by the NJBPU. Deferred Electric Service Costs Deferred Electric Service Costs decreased by $41.6 million to $15.0 million in 2006, from $56.6 million in 2005. The $41.6 million decrease represents (i) $35.9 million net under recovery associated with New Jersey BGS, NUGs, market transition charges and other restructuring items and (ii) $5.7 million in regulatory disallowances (net of amounts previously reserved) associated with the April 2005 NJBPU settlement agreement. At December 31, 2006, ACEs balance sheet included as a regulatory liability an over recovery of $164.9 million with respect primarily to these items, which is net of a $46.0 million reserve for items disallowed by the NJBPU in a ruling that is under appeal. The $164.9 million regulatory liability also includes an $81.3 million gain related to the September 1, 2006, sale of ACEs interests in Keystone and Conemaugh. Other Income (Expenses) Other expenses increased by $8.1 million to a net expense of $59.1 million in 2006, from a net expense of $51.0 million in 2005. The increase is primarily due to (i) $4.2 million increase in interest expense related to ACEs deferred electric service costs regulated liability, and (ii) $2.8 million increase due to the Contribution in Aid of Construction tax gross up. Income Tax Expense ACEs effective tax rate, excluding discontinued operations, for the year ended December 31, 2006, was 35% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The effects of state income taxes (net of federal benefit) were offset by changes in estimates related to tax liabilities of prior tax years subject to audit (which is the primary reason for the decrease in the effective rate as compared to 2005) and the flow through of deferred investment tax credits. ACEs effective tax rate, before extraordinary item and excluding discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005, was 45% as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The major reasons for this difference were state income taxes (net of federal benefit), the flow through of certain book tax depreciation differences and changes in estimates related to tax liabilities of prior tax years subject to audit (primarily due to the mixed service cost issue under Internal Revenue Service Rule 2005 53), partially offset by the flow through of deferred investment tax credits. 129 Extraordinary Item As a result of the April 2005 settlement of ACEs electric distribution rate case, ACE reversed $15.2 million in accruals related to certain deferred costs that are now deemed recoverable. The after tax credit to income of $9.0 million is classified as an extraordinary gain in the 2005 financial statements since the original accrual was part of an extraordinary charge in conjunction with the accounting for competitive restructuring in 1999.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Risk management policies for PHI and its subsidiaries are determined by PHIs Corporate Risk Management Committee, the members of which are PHIs Chief Risk Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Chief Information Officer and other senior executives. The Corporate Risk Management Committee monitors interest rate fluctuation, commodity price fluctuation, and credit risk exposure, and sets risk management policies that establish limits on unhedged risk and determine risk reporting requirements. Pepco Holdings, Inc. Commodity Price Risk The Competitive Energy segments actively engage in commodity risk management activities to reduce their financial exposure to changes in the value of their assets and obligations due to commodity price fluctuations. Certain of these risk management activities are conducted using instruments classified as derivatives under SFAS No. 133. The Competitive Energy segments also manage commodity risk with contracts that are not classified as derivatives. The Competitive Energy segments primary risk management objectives are (1) to manage the spread between the cost of fuel used to operate their electric generation plants and the revenue received from the sale of the power produced by those plants by selling forward a portion of their projected plant output and buying forward a portion of their projected fuel supply requirements and (2) to manage the spread between retail sales commitments and the cost of supply used to service those commitments in order to ensure stable and know n minimum cash flows and fix favorable prices and margins when they become available. PHIs risk management policies place oversight at the senior management level through the Corporate Risk Management Committee which has the responsibility for establishing corporate compliance requirements for the Competitive Energy businesses energy market participation. PHI collectively refers to these energy market activities, including its commodity risk management activities, as "other energy commodity" activities and identifies this activity separately from that of the discontinued proprietary trading activity. PHI uses a value at risk (VaR) model to assess the market risk of its Competitive Energy segments energy commodity activities. PHI also uses other measures to limit and monitor risk in its commodity activities, including limits on the nominal size of positions and periodic loss limits. VaR represents the potential mark to market loss on energy contracts or portfolios due to changes in market prices for a specified time period and confidence level. PHI esti mates VaR using a delta gamma variance / covariance model with a 95 percent, one tailed confidence level and assuming a one day holding period. Since VaR is an estimate, it is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur. 133 Value at Risk Associated with Energy Contracts For the Year Ended December 31, 2006 (Millions of dollars) Proprietary Trading VaR VaR for Competitive Energy Activity (1) 95% confidence level, one day holding period, one tailed Period end $ $ 5.2 Average for the period $ $12.2 High $ $23.9 Low $ $ 4.0 Notes: (1) This column represents all energy derivative contracts, normal purchase and sales contracts, modeled generation output and fuel requirements and modeled customer load obligations for the ongoing other energy commodity activities. For additional quantitative and qualitative information on the fair value of energy contracts see Note (13) "Use of Derivatives in Energy and Interest Rate Hedging Activities" to the consolidated financial statements of Pepco Holdings included in Item 8. A significant portion of the Conectiv Energys portfolio of electric generating plants consists of "mid merit" assets and peaking assets. Mid merit electric generating plants are typically combined cycle units that can quickly change their megawatt output level on an economic basis. These plants are generally operated during times when demand for electricity rises and power prices are higher. Conectiv Energy economically hedges both the estimated plant output and fuel requirements as the estimated levels of output and fuel needs change. Economic hedge percentages include the estimated electricity output of Conectiv Energys generation plants and any associated financial or physical commodity contracts (including derivative contracts that are classified as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133, other derivative instruments, wholesale normal purchase and sales contracts, and load service obligations). Conectiv Energy maintains a forward 36 month program with targeted ranges for economically hedging its projected on peak plant output combined with its on peak energy purchase commitments (based on the then current forward electricity price curve) as follows: Month Target Range 1 12 50 100% 13 24 25 75% 25 36 0 50% 134 The primary purpose of the risk management program is to improve the predictability and stability of margins by selling forward a portion of its projected plant output, and buying forward a portion of its projected fuel supply requirements. Within each period, hedged percentages can vary significantly above or below the average reported percentages. As of December 31, 2006, the electricity sold forward by Conectiv Energy as a percentage of projected on peak plant output combined with on peak energy purchase commitments was 116%, 78%, and 25% for the 1 12 month, 13 24 month and 25 36 month forward periods, respectively. These hedge percentages were above the target ranges for the 1 12 month and 13 24 month periods due to Conectiv Energys success in the default electricity supply auctions and a decrease in projected on peak plant output since the forward sale commitments were entered into. The amount of forward on peak sales during the 1 12 month period represents only 29% of Conectiv Energys combined total on peak generating capability and on peak energy purchase commitments. The volumetric percentages for the forward periods can vary and may not represent the amount of expected value hedged. Not all of the value associated with Conectiv Energys generation activities can be hedged such as the portion attributable to ancillary services and fuel switching due to the lack of market products, market liquidity, and other factors. Also the hedging of locational value and capacity can be limited. Credit and Nonperformance Risk Pepco Holdings subsidiaries attempt to minimize credit risk exposure to wholesale energy counterparties through, among other things, formal credit policies, regular assessment of counterparty creditworthiness and the establishment of a credit limit for each counterparty, monitoring procedures that include stress testing, the use of standard agreements which allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty and collateral requirements under certain circumstances, and has established reserves for credit losses. As of December 31, 2006, credit exposure to wholesale energy counterparties was weighted 55% with investment grade counterparties, 20% with counterparties without external credit quality ratings, and 25% with non investment grade counterparties. This table provides information on the Competitive Energy businesses credit exposure, net of collateral, to wholesale counterparties. 135 Schedule of Credit Risk Exposure on Competitive Wholesale Energy Contracts (Millions of dollars) December 31, 2006 Rating (1) Exposure Before Credit Collateral (2) Credit Collateral (3) Net Exposure Number of Counterparties Greater Than 10% (4) Net Exposure of Counterparties Greater Than 10% Investment Grade $76.8 $ $76.8 Non Investment Grade 35.5 1.5 34.0 1 29.8 No External Ratings 30.7 2.5 28.2 Credit reserves 1.2 (1) Investment Grade primarily determined using publicly available credit ratings of the counterparty. If the counterparty has provided a guarantee by a higher rated entity (e.g., its parent), it is determined based upon the rating of its guarantor. Included in "Investment Grade" are counterparties with a minimum Standard & Poors or Moodys Investor Service rating of BBB or Baa3, respectively. (2) Exposure before credit collateral includes the marked to market (MTM) energy contract net assets for open/unrealized transactions, the net receivable/payable for realized transactions and net open positions for contracts not subject to MTM. Amounts due from counterparties are offset by liabilities payable to those counterparties to the extent that legally enforceable netting arrangements are in place. Thus, this column presents the net credit exposure to counterparties after reflecting all allowable netting, but before considering collateral held. (3) Credit collateral the face amount of cash deposits, letters of credit and performance bonds received from counterparties, not adjusted for probability of default, and, if applicable, property interests (including oil and gas reserves). (4) Using a percentage of the total exposure. Interest Rate Risk Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries floating rate debt is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. Pepco Holdings manages interest rates through the use of fixed and, to a lesser extent, variable rate debt. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates on the annual interest costs for short term and variable rate debt was approximately $4.8 million as of December 31, 2006. Potomac Electric Power Company Interest Rate Risk Pepcos debt is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. Pepco manages interest rates through the use of fixed and, to a lesser extent, variable rate debt. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates on the annual interest costs for short term debt and variable rate debt was approximately $.8 million as of December 31, 2006. Delmarva Power & Light Company Interest Rate Risk DPLs debt is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. DPL manages interest rates through the use of fixed and, to a lesser extent, variable rate debt. 136 The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates on the annual interest costs for short term debt and variable rate debt was approximately $1.2 million as of December 31, 2006. Atlantic City Electric Company Interest Rate Risk ACEs debt is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. ACE manages interest rates through the use of fixed and, to a lesser extent, variable rate debt. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates on the annual interest costs for short term debt and variable rate debt was approximately $.3 million as of December 31, 2006.
