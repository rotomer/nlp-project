Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The information required by this item is contained herein, as follows: Registrants Page No. Pepco Holdings 41 Pepco 104 DPL 116 ACE 129 39 THIS PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK. 40 PEPCO HOLDINGS MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PEPCO HOLDINGS, INC. GENERAL OVERVIEW In 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, PHIs Power Delivery operations produced 51%, 56%, and 61% of PHIs consolidated operating revenues (including revenues from intercompany transactions) and 72%, 66%, and 67% of PHIs consolidated operating income (including income from intercompany transactions). The Power Delivery business consists primarily of the transmission, distribution and default supply of electricity, which for 2008, 2007, and 2006, was responsible for 94%, 94%, and 95%, respectively, of Power Deliverys operating revenues. The distribution of natural gas contributed 6%, 6% and 5% of Power Deliverys operating revenues in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Power Delivery represents one operating segment for financial reporting purposes. The Power Delivery business is conducted by PHIs three utility subsidiaries: Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco), Delmarva Power & Light Company (DPL) and Atlantic City Electric Company (ACE). Each of these companies is a regulated public utility in the jurisdictions that comprise its service territory. Each company is responsible for the delivery of electricity and, in the case of DPL, natural gas in its service territory, for which it is paid tariff rates established by the applicable local public service commission. Each company also supplies electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territory who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier. The regulatory term for this supply service varies by jurisdiction as follows: Delaware Standard Offer Service (SOS) District of Columbia SOS Maryland SOS New Jersey Basic Generation Service (BGS) Effective January 2, 2008, DPL sold its retail electric distribution assets and its wholesale electric transmission assets in Virginia. Prior to that date, DPL supplied electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territory who did not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier, which is referred to in Virginia as Default Service. In this Form 10 K, the supply service obligations of the respective utility subsidiaries are referred to generally as Default Electricity Supply. Pepco, DPL and ACE are also responsible for the transmission of wholesale electricity into and across their service territories. The rates each company is permitted to charge for the wholesale transmission of electricity are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Transmission rates are updated annually based on a FERC approved formula methodology. 41 PEPCO HOLDINGS The profitability of the Power Delivery business depends on its ability to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on its capital investments through the rates it is permitted to charge. The Power Delivery operating results historically have been seasonal, generally producing higher revenue and income in the warmest and coldest periods of the year. Operating results also can be affected by economic conditions, energy prices and the impact of energy efficiency measures on customer usage of electricity. In connection with its approval of new electric service distribution base rates for Pepco and DPL in Maryland, effective in June 2007 (the 2007 Maryland Rate Orders), the Maryland Public Service Commission (MPSC) approved a bill stabilization adjustment mechanism (BSA) for retail customers. For customers to which the BSA applies, Pepco and DPL recognize distribution revenue based on an approved distribution charge per customer. From a revenue recognition standpoint, the BSA thus decouples the distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period. This change in the reporting of distribution revenue has the effect of eliminating changes in retail customer usage (whether due to weather conditions, energy prices, energy efficiency programs or other reasons) as a factor having an impact on reported revenue. As a consequence, the only factors that will cause distribution revenue from retail customers in Maryland to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer. The Competitive Energy businesses provide competitive generation, marketing and supply of electricity and gas, and related energy management services primarily in the mid Atlantic region. These operations are conducted through: Subsidiaries of Conectiv Energy Holding Company (collectively, Conectiv Energy), which engage primarily in the generation and wholesale supply and marketing of electricity and gas within the PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM) and Independent System Operator New England (ISONE) wholesale markets Pepco Energy Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, Pepco Energy Services), which provides retail energy supply and energy services primarily to commercial, industrial, and governmental customers. Each of Conectiv Energy and Pepco Energy Services is a separate operating segment for financial reporting purposes. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the operating revenues of the Competitive Energy businesses (including revenue from intercompany transactions) were equal to 53%, 48%, and 43%, respectively, of PHIs consolidated operating revenues, and the operating income of the Competitive Energy businesses (including operating income from intercompany transactions) was 36%, 26%, and 20% of PHIs consolidated operating income for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, amounts equal to 7%, 10%, and 13% respectively, of the operating revenues of the Competitive Energy businesses were attributable to electric energy and capacity, and natural gas sold to the Power Delivery segment. Conectiv Energys primary objective is to maximize the value of its generation fleet by leveraging its operational and fuel flexibilities. Pepco Energy Services primary objective is to capture retail energy supply and service opportunities predominantly in the mid Atlantic region. 42 PEPCO HOLDINGS The financial results of the Competitive Energy business can be significantly affected by wholesale and retail energy prices, the cost of fuel and gas to operate the Conectiv Energy plants, and the cost of purchased energy necessary to meet its power and gas supply obligations. The Competitive Energy businesses, like the Power Delivery business, are seasonal, and therefore weather patterns can have a material impact on operating results. Through its subsidiary Potomac Capital Investment Corporation (PCI), PHI maintains a portfolio of cross border energy sale leaseback transactions with a book value at December 31, 2008 of approximately $1.3 billion. This activity constitutes a fourth operating segment, which is designated as Other Non Regulated, for financial reporting purposes. For a discussion of PHIs cross border leasing transactions, see Regulatory and Other Matters PHIs Cross Border Energy Lease Investments in this Managements Discussion and Analysis. IMPACT OF THE CURRENT CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKET DISRUPTIONS The recent disruptions in the capital and credit markets, combined with the volatility of energy prices, have had an impact on several aspects of PHIs businesses. While these conditions have required PHI and its subsidiaries to make certain adjustments in their financial management activities, PHI believes that it and its subsidiaries currently have sufficient liquidity to fund their operations and meet their financial obligations. These market conditions, should they continue, could have a negative effect on PHIs financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Liquidity Requirements PHI and its subsidiaries depend on access to the capital and credit markets to meet their liquidity and capital requirements. To meet their liquidity requirements, PHIs utility subsidiaries and its Competitive Energy businesses historically have relied on the issuance of commercial paper and short term notes and on bank lines of credit to supplement internally generated cash from operations. PHIs primary credit source is its $1.5 billion syndicated credit facility, which can be used by PHI and its utility subsidiaries to borrow funds, obtain letters of credit and support the issuance of commercial paper. This facility is in effect until May 2012 and consists of commitments from 17 lenders, no one of which is responsible for more than 8.5% of the total $1.5 billion commitment. The terms and conditions of the facility are more fully described below under the heading Capital Resources and Liquidity Credit Facilities. Due to the capital and credit market disruptions, the market for commercial paper in the latter part of 2008 was severely restricted for most companies. As a result, PHI and its subsidiaries have not been able to issue commercial paper on a day to day basis either in amounts or with maturities that they have typically required for cash management purposes. To address the challenges posed by the current capital and credit market environment and to ensure that PHI and its subsidiaries will continue to have sufficient access to cash to meet their liquidity needs, PHI and its subsidiaries have undertaken a number of actions, including the following: PHI has conducted a review to identify cash and liquidity conservation measures, including opportunities to reduce collateral obligations and to defer capital expenditures due to lower than anticipated growth. Several measures to reduce 43 PEPCO HOLDINGS collateral obligations and expenditures have been taken. Additional measures could be undertaken if conditions warrant. PHI issued an additional 16.1 million shares of the Companys common stock at a price per share of $16.50 in November 2008, for net proceeds of $255 million. PHI added a 364 day $400 million credit facility in November 2008. In November 2008, ACE issued $250 million of First Mortgage Bonds, 7.75% Series due November 15, 2018. In November 2008, DPL issued $250 million of First Mortgage Bonds, 6.40% Series due December 1, 2013. In December 2008, Pepco issued $250 million of First Mortgage Bonds, 7.90% Series due December 15, 2038. At December 31, 2008, the amount of cash, plus borrowing capacity under the syndicated credit facility and PHIs new 364 day credit facility, available to meet the liquidity needs of PHI on a consolidated basis totaled $1.5 billion, of which $843 million consisted of the combined cash and borrowing capacity of PHIs utility subsidiaries. During the months of January and February 2009, the average daily amount of the combined cash and borrowing capacity of PHI on a consolidated basis was $1.4 billion, and of its utility subsidiaries was $831 million. This decrease in liquidity of PHI on a consolidated basis was primarily due to increased collateral requirements of the Competitive Energy businesses. During the months of January and February 2009, the combined cash and borrowing capacity of PHIs utility subsidiaries ranged from a low of $673 million to a high of $1 billion. Collateral Requirements of the Competitive Energy Businesses In conducting its retail energy sales business, Pepco Energy Services typically enters into electricity and natural gas sales contracts under which it is committed to supply the electricity or natural gas requirements of its retail customers over a specified period at agreed upon prices. Generally, Pepco Energy Services acquires the energy to serve this load by entering into wholesale purchase contracts. To protect the respective parties against the risk of nonperformance by the other party, these wholesale purchase contracts typically impose collateral requirements that are tied to changes in the price of the contract commodity. In periods of energy market price volatility, these collateral obligations can fluctuate materially on a day to day basis. Pepco Energy Services practice of offsetting its retail energy sale obligations with corresponding wholesale purchases of energy has the effect of substantially reducing the exposure of its margins to energy price fluctuations. In addition, the non performance risks associated with its retail energy sales are relatively low due to the inclusion of governmental entities among its customers and the purchase of insurance on a significant portion of its commercial and other accounts receivable. However, because its retail energy sales contracts typically do not have collateral obligations, during periods of declining energy prices Pepco Energy Services is exposed to the asymmetrical risk of having to post collateral under its 44 PEPCO HOLDINGS wholesale purchase contracts without receiving a corresponding amount of collateral from its retail customers. In the second half of 2008, the decrease in energy prices has caused a significant increase in the collateral obligations of Pepco Energy Services. In addition, Conectiv Energy and Pepco Energy Services in the ordinary course of business enter into various contracts to buy and sell electricity, fuels and related products, including derivative instruments, designed to reduce their financial exposure to changes in the value of their assets and obligations due to energy price fluctuations. These contracts also typically have collateral requirements. Depending on the contract terms, the collateral required to be posted by Pepco Energy Services and Conectiv Energy can be of varying forms, including cash and letters of credit. As of December 31, 2008, the Competitive Energy businesses had posted net cash collateral of $331 million and letters of credit of $558 million. At December 31, 2008, the amount of cash, plus borrowing capacity under the syndicated credit facility and PHIs new 364 day credit facility, available to meet the liquidity needs of the Competitive Energy businesses on a consolidated basis totaled $684 million. During the months of January and February 2009, the combined cash and borrowing capacity available to PHIs Competitive Energy businesses ranged from a low of $378 million to a high of $757 million. Ongoing Monitoring of Financial and Market Conditions PHI monitors its liquidity position on a daily basis and routinely conducts stress testing to assess the impact of changes in commodity prices on its collateral requirements. Stress testing conducted over the months of January and February 2009, based on contractual rights and obligations in effect at the time, indicated that a 1% change in forward prices corresponding to the periods under the various contractual arrangements with respect to which collateral was required would have caused an estimated change of approximately $6 million in Conectiv Energys net collateral requirements and a change of approximately $17 million in Pepco Energy Services net collateral requirements. PHIs net collateral obligations decrease when forward prices increase and increase when forward prices decrease. PHI also closely monitors its credit ratings and outlooks and those of its rated subsidiaries, and computes the hypothetical effect that changes in credit ratings would have on collateral requirements and the cost of capital. Based on contractual provisions in effect at December 31, 2008, a one level downgrade in the unsecured debt credit ratings of PHI and each of its rated subsidiaries, which would decrease ratings to below investment grade, would increase the collateral obligations of PHI and its subsidiaries by up to $462 million. Counterparty Credit Risk PHI is exposed to the risk that the counterparties to contracts may fail to meet their contractual payment obligations or may fail to deliver purchased commodities or services at the contracted price. PHI attempts to minimize these risks through, among other things, formal credit policies, regular assessments of counterparty creditworthiness, and the establishment of a credit limit for each counterparty. 45 PEPCO HOLDINGS Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans PHI and its subsidiaries sponsor pension and postretirement benefit plans for their employees. While the plans have not experienced any significant impact in terms of liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the disruption of the capital and credit markets, the stock market declines have caused a decrease in the market value of benefit plan assets over the twelve months ended December 31, 2008. The negative return did not have an impact on PHIs results of operations for 2008; however, this reduction in benefit plan assets will result in increased pension and postretirement benefit costs in future years. PHI currently estimates that its net periodic pension benefit cost will be approximately $85 million in 2009, as compared to $24 million in 2008. The utility subsidiaries are generally responsible for approximately 80% to 85% of the total PHI net periodic pension benefit cost. Approximately 30% of net periodic pension benefit cost is capitalized. PHI expects to make a discretionary tax deductible contribution to the pension plan in 2009 of approximately $300 million. The utility subsidiaries will be responsible for funding their share of the contribution of approximately $170 million for Pepco, $10 million for DPL and $60 million for ACE. PHI Service Company is responsible to fund the remaining share of the contribution. PHI will monitor the markets and evaluate any additional discretionary funding needs later in the year. See Note (10), Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. BUSINESS STRATEGY PHIs business strategy is to remain a mid Atlantic regional diversified energy delivery utility and competitive energy services company focused on value creation and operational excellence. The components of this strategy include: Achieving earnings growth in the Power Delivery business by focusing on transmission and distribution infrastructure investments and constructive regulatory outcomes, while maintaining a high level of operational excellence. Supplementing PHIs utility earnings through competitive energy businesses that focus on serving the competitive wholesale and retail markets primarily within the PJM Regional Transmission Organization (PJM RTO) market. Pursuing technologies and practices that promote energy efficiency, energy conservation and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. To further this business strategy, PHI may from time to time examine a variety of transactions involving its existing businesses, including the entry into joint ventures or the disposition of one or more businesses, as well as possible acquisitions. PHI also may reassess or refine the components of its business strategy as it deems necessary or appropriate in response to a wide variety of factors, including the requirements of its businesses, competitive conditions and regulatory requirements. 46 PEPCO HOLDINGS Strategic Analysis of Pepco Energy Services Retail Energy Supply Business Over the past several months, PHI has been conducting a strategic analysis of the retail energy supply business of Pepco Energy Services. This review has included, among other things, the evaluation of potential alternative supply arrangements to reduce collateral requirements or a possible restructuring, sale or wind down of the business. As discussed above under the heading, Impact of Current Capital and Credit Market Disruption Collateral Requirements of the Competitive Energy Businesses, as energy prices have declined in the second half of 2008, the collateral that Pepco Energy Services has been required to post to secure its obligations under its wholesale energy purchase contracts has increased substantially. Among the factors being considered is the return PHI earns by investing capital in the retail energy supply business as compared to alternative investments. PHI expects the retail energy supply business to remain profitable based on its existing contract backlog and the margins that have been locked in with corresponding wholesale energy purchase contracts. The increased cost of capital associated with its collateral obligations has been factored into its retail pricing and, as a consequence, PES is experiencing reduced retail customer retention levels and reduced levels of new retail customer acquisitions. EARNINGS OVERVIEW Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2007 PHIs net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $300 million, or $1.47 per share, compared to $334 million, or $1.72 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008, included the charges set forth below in the Other Non Regulated operating segment, which are presented net of federal and state income taxes and are in millions of dollars: Adjustment to the equity value of cross border energy lease investments to reflect the impact of a change in assumptions regarding the estimated timing of the tax benefits $ (86) Additional interest accrued under Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48) related to the estimated federal and state income tax obligations from the change in assumptions regarding the estimated timing of the tax benefits on cross border energy lease investments $ (7) Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007, included the credits set forth below in the Power Delivery operating segment, which are presented net of federal and state income taxes and are in millions of dollars. Mirant Corporation (Mirant) bankruptcy damage claims settlement $ 20 Maryland income tax settlement, net of fees $ 18 Excluding the items listed above, net income would have been $393 million, or $1.93 per share, in 2008 and $296 million, or $1.53 per share, in 2007. 47 PEPCO HOLDINGS PHIs net income for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, by operating segment, is set forth in the table below (in millions of dollars): 2008 2007 Change Power Delivery $ 250 $ 232 $ 18 Conectiv Energy 122 73 49 Pepco Energy Services 39 38 1 Other Non Regulated (59) 46 (105) Corp. & Other (52) (55) 3 Total PHI Net Income $ 300 $ 334 $ (34) Discussion of Operating Segment Net Income Variances: Power Deliverys $18 million increase in earnings is primarily due to the following: $38 million increase due to the impact of the distribution base rate orders ($23 million related to Maryland, which became effective in June 2007 for Pepco and DPL, and $15 million related to the District of Columbia, which became effective in February 2008 for Pepco). $23 million increase due to favorable income tax adjustments primarily related to FIN 48 interest impact. $15 million increase due to FERC network transmission service rate changes in June 2007 and 2008. $20 million decrease due to the Mirant bankruptcy damage claims settlement in 2007. $18 million decrease due to the Maryland tax settlement, net of fees in 2007. $16 million decrease primarily due to lower sales (primarily decreased customer usage, including an unfavorable impact of weather compared to 2007). $5 million decrease due to higher operating and maintenance costs (primarily higher employee related costs and bad debt expense). Conectiv Energys $49 million increase in earnings is primarily due to the following: $43 million increase in Merchant Generation & Load Service primarily due to: (i) an increase of $22 million primarily due to short term sales of firm natural gas and natural gas transportation and storage rights, the dual fuel capability of the combined cycle mid merit units (fuel switching), cross commodity hedging (use of natural gas to hedge power positions), and the opportunities created by the mid merit combined cycle units operating flexibility (option value) in conjunction with short term power and fuel price volatility, (ii) an increase of $28 million due to higher PJM capacity prices net of capacity hedges, 48 PEPCO HOLDINGS (iii) an increase of $11 million due to the application of fair value accounting treatment and associated settlements with respect to excess coal hedges accounted for at fair value, (iv) a decrease of $9 million due to a lower of cost or market adjustment to the value of oil inventory held at the power plants at year end 2008, and (v) a decrease of $9 million due to lower sales of emissions allowances. $9 million increase in Energy Marketing primarily due to increased short term power desk margins, and new default electricity supply contracts. $5 million increase due to favorable income tax adjustments primarily due to the reversal of FIN 48 interest accruals. $10 million decrease primarily due to higher plant maintenance. Pepco Energy Services $1 million increase in earnings is primarily due to the following: $6 million increase resulting from higher volumes due to growth in the retail gas supply business. $2 million increase in the retail electricity business due to more favorable congestion costs; partially offset by higher cost of electricity and other electricity supply costs. $2 million increase resulting from favorable income tax adjustments related to deferred income taxes. $9 million decrease for the generation plants primarily due to Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) related charges. Other Non Regulateds $105 million decrease in earnings is primarily due to the following: $86 million after tax charge resulting from a $124 million adjustment to the equity value of PHIs cross border energy lease investments. $7 million after tax charge for interest accrued under FIN 48 related to estimated federal and state income tax obligations for the period from January 1, 2001 through June 30, 2008 resulting from the change in assumptions regarding the estimated timing of the tax benefits of PHIs cross border energy lease investments. $9 million decrease primarily due to favorable valuation adjustments to certain other PCI portfolio investments in 2007; partially offset by lower interest expense. Corporate and Others $3 million increase in earnings is primarily due to lower interest expense and corporate governance costs. 49 PEPCO HOLDINGS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following results of operations discussion compares the year ended December 31, 2008, to the year ended December 31, 2007. All amounts in the tables (except sales and customers) are in millions. Operating Revenue A detail of the components of PHIs consolidated operating revenue is as follows: 2008 2007 Change Power Delivery $ 5,487 $ 5,244 $ 243 Conectiv Energy 3,047 2,206 841 Pepco Energy Services 2,648 2,309 339 Other Non Regulated (60) 76 (136) Corp. & Other (422) (469) 47 Total Operating Revenue $ 10,700 $ 9,366 $ 1,334 Power Delivery The following table categorizes Power Deliverys operating revenue by type of revenue. 2008 2007 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 1,690 $ 1,592 $ 98 Default Supply Revenue 3,413 3,295 118 Other Electric Revenue 66 66 Total Electric Operating Revenue 5,169 4,953 216 Regulated Gas Revenue 204 211 (7) Other Gas Revenue 114 80 34 Total Gas Operating Revenue 318 291 27 Total Power Delivery Operating Revenue $ 5,487 $ 5,244 $ 243 Regulated Transmission and Distribution (T&D) Electric Revenue includes revenue from the delivery of electricity, including the delivery of Default Electricity Supply, by PHIs utility subsidiaries to customers within their service territories at regulated rates. Regulated T&D Electric Revenue also includes transmission service revenue that PHIs utility subsidiaries receive as transmission owners from PJM. Default Supply Revenue is the revenue received for Default Electricity Supply. The costs related to Default Electricity Supply are included in Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales. Default Supply Revenue also includes revenue from transition bond charges and other restructuring related revenues. Other Electric Revenue includes work and services performed on behalf of customers, including other utilities, which is not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes 50 PEPCO HOLDINGS mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of pole attachments, late payment fees, and collection fees. Regulated Gas Revenue consists of revenues from on system natural gas sales and the transportation of natural gas for customers by DPL within its service territories at regulated rates. Other Gas Revenue consists of DPLs off system natural gas sales and the sale of excess system capacity. In response to an order issued by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) regarding changes to ACEs retail transmission rates, ACE has established deferred accounting treatment for the difference between the rates that ACE is authorized to charge its customers for the transmission of Default Electricity Supply and the cost that ACE incurs. Under the deferral arrangement, any over or under recovery is deferred as part of Deferred Electric Service Costs pending an adjustment of retail rates in a future proceeding. As a consequence of the order, effective January 1, 2008, ACEs retail transmission revenue is being recorded as Default Supply Revenue, rather than as Regulated T&D Electric Revenue, thereby conforming to the practice of PHIs other utility subsidiaries, which previously established deferred accounting treatment for any over or under recovery of retail transmission rates relative to the cost incurred. ACEs retail transmission revenue for the period prior to January 1, 2008 has been reclassified to Default Supply Revenue in order to conform to the current period presentation.

The Pepco, DPL and ACE service territories are located within a corridor extending from Washington, D.C. to southern New Jersey. These service territories are economically diverse and include key industries that contribute to the regional economic base. Commercial activity in the region includes banking and other professional services, government, insurance, real estate, shopping malls, casinos, stand alone construction, and tourism. Industrial activity in the region includes automotive, chemical, glass, pharmaceutical, steel manufacturing, food processing, and oil refining. Regulated T&D Electric Revenue increased by $98 million primarily due to: An increase of $28 million due to a distribution rate change under the 2007 Maryland Rate Orders that became effective in June 2007, including a positive $19 million Revenue Decoupling Adjustment. An increase of $24 million due to a distribution rate change in the District of Columbia that became effective in February 2008. An increase of $24 million due to a distribution rate change as part of a higher New Jersey Societal Benefit Charge that became effective in June 2008 (substantially offset in Deferred Electric Service Costs). An increase of $24 million in transmission service revenue primarily due to transmission rate changes in June 2008 and 2007. 52 PEPCO HOLDINGS An increase of $24 million in Other Regulated T&D Electric Revenue from the resale of energy and capacity purchased under the power purchase agreement between Panda Brandywine, L.P. (Panda) and Pepco (the Panda PPA) (offset in Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales. An increase of $4 million due to customer growth of 1% in 2008 (excluding customers associated with the sale of DPLs Virginia retail electric distribution and wholesale transmission assets in January 2008). The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $20 million due to lower weather related sales (a 2% decrease in Heating Degree Days and a 10% decrease in Cooling Degree Days). A decrease of $12 million due to the sale of DPLs Virginia retail electric distribution and wholesale transmission assets in January 2008.

Default Supply Revenue, which is substantially offset in Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales and Deferred Electric Service Costs, increased by $118 million primarily due to: An increase of $202 million in market based Default Electricity Supply rates. An increase of $48 million in wholesale energy revenues due to the sale in PJM RTO at higher market prices of electricity purchased from NUGs. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $55 million due to lower weather related sales (a 2% decrease in Heating Degree Days and a 10% decrease in Cooling Degree Days). A decrease of $33 million primarily due to existing commercial and industrial customers electing to purchase electricity from competitive suppliers. A decrease of $32 million due to the sale of DPLs Virginia retail electric distribution and wholesale transmission assets in January 2008.

Commercial activity in the region includes banking and other professional services, government, insurance, real estate, shopping malls, stand alone construction and tourism. Industrial activity in the region includes automotive, chemical and pharmaceutical. Regulated Gas Revenue decreased by $7 million primarily due to: A decrease of $4 million due to differences in consumption among the various customer rate classes. A decrease of $3 million due to lower weather related sales (a 3% decrease in Heating Degree Days). A decrease of $2 million primarily due to Gas Cost Rate changes effective April 2007, November 2007 and November 2008. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $2 million due to a distribution base rate change effective April 2007. Other Gas Revenue Other Gas Revenue, which is substantially offset in Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales, increased by $34 million primarily due to revenue from higher off system sales, the result of an increase in market prices. Off system sales are made possible due to available pipeline capacity that results from low demand for natural gas from regulated customers. Conectiv Energy The impact of Operating Revenue changes and Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales changes with respect to the Conectiv Energy component of the Competitive Energy business are encompassed within the discussion that follows. 55 PEPCO HOLDINGS Operating Revenues of the Conectiv Energy segment are derived primarily from the sale of electricity. The primary components of its costs of sales are fuel and purchased power. Because fuel and electricity prices tend to move in tandem, price changes in these commodities from period to period can have a significant impact on Operating Revenue and Costs of Sales without signifying any change in the performance of the Conectiv Energy segment. Conectiv Energy also uses a number of and various types of derivative contracts to lock in sales margins, and to economically hedge its power and fuel purchases and sales. Gains and losses on derivative contracts are netted in revenue and Cost of Sales as appropriate under the applicable accounting rules. For these reasons, PHI from a managerial standpoint focuses on gross margin as a measure of performance. Conectiv Energy Gross Margin Merchant Generation & Load Service consists primarily of electric power, capacity and ancillary services sales from Conectiv Energys generating plants; tolling arrangements entered into to sell energy and other products from Conectiv Energys generating plants and to purchase energy and other products from generating plants of other companies; hedges of power, capacity, fuel and load; the sale of excess fuel (primarily natural gas); natural gas transportation and storage; emission allowances; electric power, capacity, and ancillary services sales pursuant to competitively bid contracts entered into with affiliated and non affiliated companies to fulfill their default electricity supply obligations; and fuel switching activities made possible by the multi fuel capabilities of some of Conectiv Energys power plants. Energy Marketing activities consist primarily of wholesale natural gas and fuel oil marketing, the activities of the short term power desk, which generates margin by capturing price differences between power pools and locational and timing differences within a power pool, and power origination activities, which primarily represent the fixed margin component of structured power transactions such as default supply service. 56 PEPCO HOLDINGS Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Change Operating Revenue ($ millions): Merchant Generation & Load Service $ 1,846 $ 1,087 $ 759 Energy Marketing 1,201 1,119 82 Total Operating Revenue1 $ 3,047 $ 2,206 $ 841 Cost of Sales ($ millions): Merchant Generation & Load Service $ 1,492 $ 806 $ 686 Energy Marketing 1,148 1,081 67 Total Cost of Sales2 $ 2,640 $ 1,887 $ 753 Gross Margin ($ millions): Merchant Generation & Load Service $ 354 $ 281 $ 73 Energy Marketing 53 38 15 Total Gross Margin $ 407 $ 319 $ 88 Generation Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses ($ millions) 3: Generation Fuel Expenses 4,5 Natural Gas $ 223 $ 268 $ (45) Coal 57 62 (5) Oil 46 34 12 Other6 2 2 Total Generation Fuel Expenses $ 328 $ 366 $ (38) Purchased Power Expenses 5 $ 992 $ 480 $ 512 Statistics: 2008 2007 Change Generation Output (MWh): Base Load 7 1,710,916 2,232,499 (521,583) Mid Merit (Combined Cycle) 8 2,625,668 3,341,716 (716,048) Mid Merit (Other) 9 74,254 190,253 (115,999) Peaking 78,450 146,486 (68,036) Tolled Generation 116,776 160,755 (43,979) Total 4,606,064 6,071,709 (1,465,645) Load Service Volume (MWh) 10 10,629,905 7,075,743 3,554,162 Average Power Sales Price 11($/MWh): Generation Sales 4 $ 109.71 $ 82.19 $ 27.52 Non Generation Sales 12 $ 92.02 $ 70.43 $ 21.59 Total $ 96.92 $ 74.34 $ 22.58 Average on peak spot power price at PJM East Hub ($/MWh) 13 $ 91.73 $ 77.85 $ 13.88 Average around the clock spot power price at PJM East Hub ($/MWh) 13 $ 77.15 $ 63.92 $ 13.23 Average spot natural gas price at market area M3 ($/MMBtu)14 $ 9.83 $ 7.76 $ 2.07 Weather (degree days at Philadelphia Airport): 15 Heating degree days 4,403 4,560 (157) Cooling degree days 1,354 1,513 (159) 1 Includes $397 million and $442 million of affiliate transactions for 2008 and 2007, respectively. 2 Includes $6 million and $7 million of affiliate transactions for 2008 and 2007, respectively.

In 2008, Conectiv Energy expanded its default electricity supply business into ISONE. Conectiv Energys margins were favorably impacted by higher energy commodity prices in the first half of 2008, and unfavorably impacted by the decrease in prices and spark spreads during the second half of the year. Volatile commodity prices contributed to significant movements in the value of transactions accounted for at fair value. Merchant Generation & Load Service gross margin increased approximately $73 million primarily due to: An increase of approximately $37 million primarily due to short term sales of firm natural gas, and natural gas transportation and storage rights, the dual fuel capability of the combined cycle mid merit units (fuel switching), cross commodity hedging (use of natural gas to hedge power positions), and the opportunities created by the mid merit combined cycle units operating flexibility (option value) in conjunction with short term power and fuel price volatility. This combination of strategies positioned Conectiv Energy to realize the upside potential of its overall portfolio during the winter period. The magnitude of gain was due partly to significant fuel price increases in conjunction with less significant increases in power prices. An increase of approximately $46 million due to higher PJM capacity prices net of capacity hedges. An increase of approximately $18 million due to the application of fair value accounting treatment and associated settlements with respect to excess coal hedges. A decrease of approximately $15 million due to a lower of cost or market adjustment to the value of oil inventory held at the power plants at year end 2008. A decrease of approximately $15 million due to lower sales of emissions allowances. Energy Marketing gross margin increased approximately $15 million primarily due to: An increase of approximately $9 million in short term power desk margins in 2008. An increase of approximately $9 million due to additional default electricity supply contracts in 2008. A decrease of approximately $4 million due to lower wholesale gas margins. Pepco Energy Services Pepco Energy Services operating revenue increased by $339 million to $2,648 million in 2008 from $2,309 million in 2007 primarily due to: 58 PEPCO HOLDINGS An increase of $259 million due to higher volumes of retail electric load served due to customer acquisitions and higher prices in 2008, An increase of $64 million due to higher natural gas volumes driven by customer acquisitions and higher prices in 2008, An increase of $26 million due to increased construction activities in 2008; The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $11 million due to RPM related charges that lowered capacity revenues for the generation plants. Other Non regulated Other Non Regulated operating revenue decreased by $136 million primarily due to: A non cash charge of $124 million was recorded during 2008 as a result of revised assumptions regarding the estimated timing of tax benefits from PCIs cross border energy lease investments. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position 13 2, this charge was recorded as a reduction to lease revenue from these transactions, which is included in Other Non Regulated revenues. Operating Expenses Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales A detail of PHIs consolidated Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales is as follows: 2008 2007 Change Power Delivery $ 3,578 $ 3,360 $ 218 Conectiv Energy 2,640 1,887 753 Pepco Energy Services 2,489 2,161 328 Corp. & Other (418) (465) 47 Total $ 8,289 $ 6,943 $ 1,346 Power Delivery Power Deliverys Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales, which is primarily associated with Default Electricity Supply sales, increased by $218 million primarily due to: An increase of $333 million in average energy costs, the result of new Default Electricity Supply contracts. 59 PEPCO HOLDINGS An increase of $32 million in gas purchases for off system sales, the result of higher average gas costs. An increase of $24 million for energy and capacity purchased under the Panda PPA. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $61 million primarily due to commercial and industrial customers electing to purchase electricity from competitive suppliers. A decrease of $60 million due to lower weather related sales. A decrease of $45 million due to the sale of Virginia retail electric distribution and wholesale transmission assets in January 2008. Fuel and Purchased Energy expense is substantially offset in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue, Default Supply Revenue, Regulated Gas Revenue and Other Gas Revenue. Conectiv Energy The impact of Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales changes with respect to the Conectiv Energy component of the Competitive Energy business are encompassed within the prior discussion under the heading Conectiv Energy Gross Margin. Pepco Energy Services Pepco Energy Services Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales increased $328 million primarily due to: An increase of $236 million due to higher volumes of electricity purchased at higher prices in 2008 to serve increased retail customer load. An increase of $65 million due to higher volumes of natural gas purchased at higher prices in 2008 to serve increased retail customer load. An increase of $15 million due to increased construction activities in 2008. An increase of $12 million for the generation plants primarily due to capacity costs related to RPM. 60 PEPCO HOLDINGS Other Operation and Maintenance A detail of PHIs other operation and maintenance expense is as follows: 2008 2007 Change Power Delivery $ 702 $ 667 $ 35 Conectiv Energy 143 127 16 Pepco Energy Services 87 74 13 Other Non Regulated 2 3 (1) Corp. & Other (17) (13) (4) Total $ 917 $ 858 $ 59 Other Operation and Maintenance expenses of the Power Delivery segment increased by $35 million; however, excluding $3 million resulting from the operation of ACEs B.L. England electric generating facility prior to its sale in February 2007, Other Operation and Maintenance expenses increased by $38 million. The $38 million increase was primarily due to: An increase of $17 million in deferred administrative expenses associated with Default Electricity Supply (offset in Default Supply Revenue) due to (i) the inclusion of $10 million of customer late payment fees in the calculation of the deferral and (ii) a higher rate of recovery of bad debt and administrative expenses as a result of an increase in Default Electricity Supply revenue rates. See the discussion below regarding a 2008 correction of errors in recording customer late payment fees, including $6 million related to prior periods. An increase of $11 million due to higher bad debt expenses associated with distribution and Default Electricity Supply customers, of which approximately $6 million was deferred. An increase of $9 million in employee related costs primarily due to the recording of additional stock based compensation expense as discussed below, including $6 million related to prior periods. An increase of $3 million in Demand Side Management program costs (offset in Deferred Electric Service Costs). An increase of $3 million in legal expenses. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $3 million in corrective and preventative maintenance and emergency restoration costs. A decrease of $4 million in regulatory expenses primarily due to higher expenses in 2007 relating to the District of Columbia distribution rate case. A decrease of $3 million due to higher construction project write offs in 2007 related to customer requested work. 61 PEPCO HOLDINGS A decrease of $2 million in accounting services related to tax consulting fees. Other Operation and Maintenance expense for Conectiv Energy increased by $16 million primarily due to increased planned maintenance at its power plants. Other Operation and Maintenance expense for Pepco Energy Services increased by $13 million due to increased compensation, benefit, outside contractor and regulatory costs related to growth in its businesses. During 2008, PHI recorded adjustments, on a consolidated basis, to correct errors in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses for prior periods dating back to February 2005 during which (i) customer late payment fees were incorrectly recognized and (ii) stock based compensation expense related to certain restricted stock awards granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan was understated. The late payment fees and stock based compensation adjustments resulted in increases in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 of $6 million and $9 million, respectively. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and Amortization expenses increased by $11 million to $377 million in 2008 from $366 million in 2007. The increase was primarily due to: An increase of $21 million due to higher amortization by ACE of stranded costs as a result of an October 2007 Transition Bond Charge rate increase (offset in Default Supply Revenue) An increase of $7 million due to utility plant additions. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $15 million due to a change in depreciation rates in accordance with the 2007 Maryland Rate Orders. Deferred Electric Service Costs Deferred Electric Service Costs, which relate only to ACE, decreased by $77 million to income of $9 million in 2008 from an expense of $68 million in 2007. The decrease was primarily due to: A decrease of $46 million due to a lower rate of recovery associated with deferred energy costs. A decrease of $29 million due to a lower rate of recovery of costs associated with energy and capacity purchased under the NUGs. A decrease of $17 million due to a lower rate of recovery associated with deferred transmission costs. 62 PEPCO HOLDINGS The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $15 million primarily due to a higher rate of recovery associated with Demand Side Management program costs. Deferred Electric Service Costs are substantially offset in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue and Other Operation and Maintenance. Impairment Losses During 2008, Pepco Holdings recorded pre tax impairment losses of $2 million ($1 million after tax) related to a joint venture investment owned by Conectiv Energy. During 2007, Pepco Holdings recorded pre tax impairment losses of $2 million ($1 million after tax) related to certain energy services business assets owned by Pepco Energy Services. Effect of Settlement of Mirant Bankruptcy Claims The Effect of Settlement of Mirant Bankruptcy Claims reflects the recovery in 2007 of $33 million in operating expenses and certain other costs as damages in the Mirant bankruptcy settlement. See Capital Resources and Liquidity Cash Flow Activity Proceeds from Settlement of Mirant Bankruptcy Claims herein. Other Income (Expenses) Other Expenses (which are net of Other Income) increased by $16 million to a net expense of $300 million in 2008 from a net expense of $284 million in 2007 due to: A decrease of $15 million in income from equity investments. A decrease of $5 million in Contribution in Aid of Construction tax gross up income. The aggregate amount of these decreases in income was partially offset by: A net decrease of $10 million in interest expense. Income Tax Expense PHIs effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were 35.9% and 36.0%, respectively. While the change in the effective rate between 2008 and 2007 was minimal, the effective rate in each year was impacted by certain non recurring items. In 2008, PHI recorded certain tax benefits that reduced its overall effective tax rate, primarily representing net interest income accrued on effectively settled and uncertain tax positions (including interest related to the tentative settlements with the IRS on the mixed service cost and like kind exchange issues discussed below and a claim made with the IRS related to ACEs tax reporting of fuel over and under recoveries), interest income received in 2008 on the Maryland state tax refund referred to below, and deferred tax adjustments related to additional analysis of its deferred tax balances completed in 2008. These benefits were partially offset by limited federal and state tax benefits related to the charge taken on the cross border energy lease investments in the second 63 PEPCO HOLDINGS quarter of 2008. In 2007, PHI recorded the receipt of Pepcos Maryland state tax refund in the third quarter of 2007 as a reduction in income tax expense. During the second quarter 2008, PHI reached a tentative settlement with the IRS concerning the treatment by Pepco, DPL and ACE of mixed service construction costs for income tax purposes during the period 2001 to 2004. On the basis of the tentative settlement, PHI updated its estimated liability related to mixed service costs and, as a result, recorded a net reduction in its liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $19 million and recognized after tax interest income of $7 million in the second quarter of 2008. See Note (16), Commitments and ContingenciesRegulatory and Other Matters IRS Mixed Service Cost Issue, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. During the fourth quarter of 2008, PHI reached a final settlement with the IRS concerning a transaction between Conectiv and an unaffiliated third party that was treated by Conectiv as a like kind exchange under Internal Revenue Code Section 1031. PHIs reserve for this issue was more conservative than the actual settlement and resulted in the reversal of a total of $5 million (after tax) in excess accrued interest related to this matter in the fourth quarter of 2008. See Note (16), Commitments and Contingencies Regulatory and Other Matters IRS Examination of Like Kind Exchange Transaction to the consolidated financial statements of PHI set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The following results of operations discussion compares the year ended December 31, 2007, to the year ended December 31, 2006. All amounts in the tables (except sales and customers) are in millions. Operating Revenue A detail of the components of PHIs consolidated operating revenue is as follows: 2007 2006 Change Power Delivery $ 5,244 $ 5,119 $ 125 Conectiv Energy 2,206 1,964 242 Pepco Energy Services 2,309 1,669 640 Other Non Regulated 76 91 (15) Corp. & Other (469) (480) 11 Total Operating Revenue $ 9,366 $ 8,363 $ 1,003 64 PEPCO HOLDINGS Power Delivery The following table categorizes Power Deliverys operating revenue by type of revenue. 2007 2006 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 1,592 $ 1,496 $ 96 Default Supply Revenue 3,295 3,309 (14) Other Electric Revenue 66 58 8 Total Electric Operating Revenue 4,953 4,863 90 Regulated Gas Revenue 211 205 6 Other Gas Revenue 80 51 29 Total Gas Operating Revenue 291 256 35 Total Power Delivery Operating Revenue $ 5,244 $ 5,119 $ 125 Regulated Transmission and Distribution (T&D) Electric Revenue includes revenue from the delivery of electricity, including the delivery of Default Electricity Supply, by PHIs utility subsidiaries to customers within their service territories at regulated rates. Regulated T&D Electric Revenue also includes transmission service revenue that PHIs utility subsidiaries receive as transmission owners from PJM. Default Supply Revenue is the revenue received for Default Electricity Supply. The costs related to Default Electricity Supply are included in Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales. Default Supply Revenue also includes revenue from transition bond charges and other restructuring related revenues. Other Electric Revenue includes work and services performed on behalf of customers, including other utilities, which is not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of pole attachments, late payment fees, and collection fees. Regulated Gas Revenue consists of revenues for on system natural gas sales and the transportation of natural gas for customers by DPL within its service territories at regulated rates. Other Gas Revenue consists of DPLs off system natural gas sales and the sale of excess system capacity. In response to an order issued by the NJBPU regarding changes to ACEs retail transmission rates, ACE has established deferred accounting treatment for the difference between the rates that ACE is authorized to charge its customers for the transmission of default electricity supply and the cost that ACE incurs. Under the deferral arrangement, any over or under recovery is deferred as part of Deferred Electric Service Costs pending an adjustment of retail rates in a future proceeding. As a consequence of the order, effective January 1, 2008, ACEs retail transmission revenue is being recorded as Default Supply Revenue, rather than as Regulated T&D Electric Revenue, thereby conforming to the practice of PHIs other utility subsidiaries, which previously established deferred accounting treatment for any over or under 65 PEPCO HOLDINGS recovery of retail transmission rates relative to the cost incurred. In addition, ACEs retail transmission revenue for the period prior to January 1, 2008 has been reclassified to Default Supply Revenue in order to conform to the current period presentation.

The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: 69 PEPCO HOLDINGS A decrease of $18 million due to Gas Cost Rate decreases effective November 2006, April 2007 and November 2007 resulting from lower natural gas commodity costs (offset in Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales). Other Gas Revenue Other Gas Revenue increased by $29 million to $80 million in 2007 from $51 million in 2006 primarily due to higher off system sales (partially offset in Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales). The gas sold off system resulted from increased demand from unaffiliated third party electric generators during periods of low customer demand for natural gas. Conectiv Energy Conectiv Energy Gross Margin Merchant Generation & Load Service consists primarily of electric power, capacity and ancillary services sales from Conectiv Energys generating plants; tolling arrangements entered into to sell energy and other products from Conectiv Energys generating plants and to purchase energy and other products from generating plants of other companies; hedges of power, capacity, fuel and load; the sale of excess fuel (primarily natural gas); natural gas transportation and storage; emission allowances; electric power, capacity, and ancillary services sales pursuant to competitively bid contracts entered into with affiliated and non affiliated companies to fulfill their default electricity supply obligations; and fuel switching activities made possible by the multi fuel capabilities of some of Conectiv Energys power plants. Energy Marketing activities consist primarily of wholesale natural gas and fuel oil marketing, the activities of the short term power desk, which generates margin by capturing price differences between power pools and locational and timing differences within a power pool, and power origination activities, which primarily represent the fixed margin component of structured power transactions such as default supply service. 70 PEPCO HOLDINGS Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Change Operating Revenue ($ millions): Merchant Generation & Load Service $ 1,087 $ 1,073 $ 14 Energy Marketing 1,119 891 228 Total Operating Revenue1 $ 2,206 $ 1,964 $ 242 Cost of Sales ($ millions): Merchant Generation & Load Service $ 806 $ 861 $ (55) Energy Marketing 1,081 848 233 Total Cost of Sales2 $ 1,887 $ 1,709 $ 178 Gross Margin ($ millions): Merchant Generation & Load Service $ 281 $ 212 $ 69 Energy Marketing 38 43 (5) Total Gross Margin $ 319 $ 255 $ 64 Generation Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses ($ millions) 3: Generation Fuel Expenses 4,5 Natural Gas6 $ 268 $ 175 $ 93 Coal 62 53 9 Oil 34 27 7 Other7 2 4 (2) Total Generation Fuel Expenses $ 366 $ 259 $ 107 Purchased Power Expenses 5 $ 480 $ 431 $ 49 Statistics: 2007 2006 Change Generation Output (MWh): Base Load 8 2,232,499 1,814,517 417,982 Mid Merit (Combined Cycle) 9 3,341,716 2,081,873 1,259,843 Mid Merit (Other) 10 190,253 115,120 75,133 Peaking 146,486 131,930 14,556 Tolled Generation 160,755 94,064 66,691 Total 6,071,709 4,237,504 1,834,205 Load Service Volume (MWh) 11 7,075,743 8,514,719 (1,438,976) Average Power Sales Price 12($/MWh): Generation Sales 4 $ 82.19 $ 77.69 $ 4.50 Non Generation Sales 13 $ 70.43 $ 58.49 $ 11.94 Total $ 74.34 $ 62.54 $ 11.80 Average on peak spot power price at PJM East Hub ($/MWh) 14 $ 77.85 $ 65.29 $ 12.56 Average around the clock spot power price at PJM East Hub ($/MWh) 14 $ 63.92 $ 53.07 $ 10.85 Average spot natural gas price at market area M3 ($/MMBtu)15 $ 7.76 $ 7.31 $ 0.45 Weather (degree days at Philadelphia Airport): 16 Heating degree days 4,560 4,205 355 Cooling degree days 1,513 1,136 377 1 Includes $442 million and $471 million of affiliate transactions for 2007 and 2006, respectively.

An increase of approximately $26 million due to higher capacity prices due to the implementation of the PJM Reliability Pricing Model. A decrease of $33 million due to less favorable natural gas fuel hedges, and the expiration, in 2006, of an agreement with an international investment banking firm to hedge approximately 50% of the commodity price risk of Conectiv Energys generation and Default Electricity Supply commitment to DPL. Energy Marketing gross margin decreased $5 million primarily due to: A decrease of $5 million due to lower margins in oil marketing. A decrease of $4 million due to lower margins in natural gas marketing. An increase of $3 million for adjustments related to an unaffiliated generation operating services agreement that expired in 2006. Pepco Energy Services Pepco Energy Services operating revenue increased $640 million to $2,309 million in 2007 from $1,669 million in 2006 primarily due to: An increase of $646 million due to higher volumes of retail electric load served at higher prices in 2007 driven by customer acquisitions. An increase of $27 million due to higher volumes of wholesale natural gas sales in 2007 that resulted from increased natural gas supply transactions to deliver gas to retail customers. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $32 million due primarily to lower construction activity in 2007 and to the sale of five construction businesses in 2006. Other Non Regulated Other Non Regulated operating revenue decreased $15 million to $76 million in 2007 from $91 million in 2006. The operating revenue of this segment primarily consists of lease earnings recognized under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases. The revenue decrease is primarily due to: 72 PEPCO HOLDINGS A change in state income tax lease assumptions that resulted in increased revenue in 2006 as compared to 2007. Operating Expenses Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales A detail of PHIs consolidated Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales is as follows: 2007 2006 Change Power Delivery $ 3,360 $ 3,304 $ 56 Conectiv Energy 1,887 1,709 178 Pepco Energy Services 2,161 1,531 630 Corp. & Other (465) (478) 13 Total $ 6,943 $ 6,066 $ 877 Power Delivery Power Deliverys Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales, which is primarily associated with Default Electricity Supply sales, increased by $56 million primarily due to: An increase of $445 million in average energy costs, the result of new Default Electricity Supply contracts. An increase of $93 million due to higher weather related sales. An increase of $29 million for energy and capacity purchased under the Panda PPA. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $472 million primarily due to commercial and industrial customers electing to purchase an increased amount of electricity from competitive suppliers. A decrease of $36 million in the Default Electricity Supply deferral balance. Fuel and Purchased Energy expense is primarily offset in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue, Default Supply Revenue, Regulated Gas Revenue or Other Gas Revenue. 73 PEPCO HOLDINGS Conectiv Energy The impact of Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales changes with respect to the Conectiv Energy component of the Competitive Energy business are encompassed within the prior discussion under the heading Conectiv Energy Gross Margin. Pepco Energy Services Pepco Energy Services Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales increased $630 million primarily due to: An increase of $636 million due to higher volumes of purchased electricity at higher prices in 2007 to serve increased retail customer load. An increase of $40 million due to higher volumes of wholesale natural gas sales in 2007 that resulted from increased natural gas supply transactions to deliver gas to retail customers. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $45 million due primarily to lower construction activity in 2007 and to the sale of five construction businesses in 2006. Other Operation and Maintenance A detail of PHIs other operation and maintenance expense is as follows: 2007 2006 Change Power Delivery $ 667 $ 640 $ 27 Conectiv Energy 127 116 11 Pepco Energy Services 74 68 6 Other Non Regulated 3 4 (1) Corp. & Other (13) (20) 7 Total $ 858 $ 808 $ 50 Other Operation and Maintenance expense of the Power Delivery segment increased by $27 million; however, excluding the favorable variance of $34 million primarily resulting from ACEs sale of the B.L. England electric generating facility in February 2007, Other Operation and Maintenance expenses increased by $61 million. The $61 million increase was primarily due to: An increase of $16 million in employee related costs. An increase of $11 million in preventative maintenance and system operation costs. An increase of $7 million in customer service operation expenses. 74 PEPCO HOLDINGS An increase of $4 million in costs associated with Default Electricity Supply (primarily deferred and recoverable). An increase of $4 million in regulatory expenses. An increase of $4 million in accounting service expenses. An increase of $3 million due to various construction project write offs related to customer requested work. An increase of $3 million in Demand Side Management program costs (offset in Deferred Electric Service Costs). An increase of $3 million due to higher bad debt expenses. Other Operation and Maintenance expense for Conectiv Energy increased by $11 million primarily due to: Higher plant maintenance costs due to more scheduled outages in 2007 and higher costs of materials and labor. Other Operation and Maintenance expense for Pepco Energy Services increased by $6 million due to: Higher retail electric and gas operating costs to support the growth in the retail business in 2007. Other Operation and Maintenance expense for Corporate & Other increased by $7 million due to: An increase in employee related costs. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and Amortization expenses decreased by $47 million to $366 million in 2007 from $413 million in 2006. The decrease is primarily due to: A decrease of $31 million in ACEs regulatory asset amortization resulting primarily from the 2006 sale of ACEs interests in Keystone and Conemaugh. A decrease of $19 million in depreciation due to a change in depreciation rates in accordance with the 2007 Maryland Rate Order. Other Taxes Other Taxes increased by $14 million to $357 million in 2007 from $343 million in 2006. The increase was primarily due to: 75 PEPCO HOLDINGS An increase in pass throughs resulting from tax rate increases (partially offset in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue). Deferred Electric Service Costs Deferred Electric Service Costs, which relate only to ACE, increased by $46 million to $68 million in 2007 from $22 million in 2006. The increase is primarily due to: An increase of $38 million due to a higher rate of recovery associated with energy and capacity purchased under the NUGs. An increase of $12 million due to a higher rate of recovery associated with deferred energy costs. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $3 million due to a lower rate of recovery associated with Demand Side Management program costs. Deferred Electric Service Costs are substantially offset in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue and Other Operation and Maintenance. Impairment Losses During 2007, Pepco Holdings recorded pre tax impairment losses of $2 million ($1 million after tax) related to certain energy services business assets owned by Pepco Energy Services. During 2006, Pepco Holdings recorded pre tax impairment losses of $19 million ($14 million after tax) related to certain energy services business assets owned by Pepco Energy Services. Effect of Settlement of Mirant Bankruptcy Claims The Effect of Settlement of Mirant Bankruptcy Claims reflects the recovery in 2007 of $33 million in operating expenses and certain other costs as damages in the Mirant bankruptcy settlement. See Capital Resources and Liquidity Proceeds from Settlement of Mirant Bankruptcy Claims herein. Income Tax Expense PHIs effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were 36.0% and 39.3%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2007 was primarily the result of a 2007 Maryland state income tax refund. The refund was due to an increase in the tax basis of certain assets sold in 2000, and as a result, PHIs 2007 income tax expense was reduced by approximately $20 million, with a corresponding decrease to the effective tax rate of 3.7%. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY This section discusses Pepco Holdings working capital, cash flow activity, capital requirements and other uses and sources of capital. 76 PEPCO HOLDINGS Working Capital At December 31, 2008, Pepco Holdings current assets on a consolidated basis totaled $2.6 billion and its current liabilities totaled $2 billion. At December 31, 2007, Pepco Holdings current assets on a consolidated basis totaled $2 billion and its current liabilities totaled $2 billion. The increase in working capital from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008 is primarily due to an increase in cash as a result of the issuance of long term debt during the fourth quarter of 2008. At December 31, 2008, Pepco Holdings cash and current cash equivalents totaled $384 million, of which $343 million was invested in money market funds that invest in U.S. Treasury obligations, and the balance was held as cash and uncollected funds. Current restricted cash (cash that is available to be used only for designated purposes) totaled $10 million. At December 31, 2007, Pepco Holdings cash and current cash equivalents totaled $55 million and its current restricted cash totaled $15 million. See Capital Requirements Contractual Arrangements with Credit Rating Triggers or Margining Rights herein for additional information.

The aggregate borrowing limit under this primary credit facility is $1.5 billion, all or any portion of which may be used to obtain loans or to issue letters of credit. PHIs credit limit under the facility is $875 million. The credit limit of each of Pepco, DPL and ACE is the lesser of $500 million and the maximum amount of debt the company is permitted to have outstanding by its regulatory authorities, except that the aggregate amount of credit used by Pepco, DPL and ACE at any given time collectively may not exceed $625 million. The interest rate payable by each company on utilized funds is, at the borrowing companys election, (i) the greater of the prevailing prime rate and the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% or (ii) the prevailing Eurodollar rate, plus a margin that varies according to the credit rating of the borrower. The facility also includes a swingline loan sub facility pursuant to which each company may make same day borrowings in an aggregate amount not to exceed $150 million. Any swingline loan must be repaid by the borrower within seven days of receipt thereof. All indebtedness incurred under the facility is unsecured. The facility commitment expiration date is May 5, 2012, with each company having the right to elect to have 100% of the principal balance of the loans outstanding on the expiration date continued as non revolving term loans for a period of one year from such expiration date. The facility is intended to serve primarily as a source of liquidity to support the commercial paper programs of the respective companies. The companies also are permitted to use the facility to borrow funds for general corporate purposes and issue letters of credit. In order for a borrower to use the facility, certain representations and warranties must be true and correct, and the borrower must be in compliance with specified covenants, including (i) the requirement that each borrowing company maintain a ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization of 65% or less, computed in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement, which calculation excludes from the definition of total indebtedness certain trust preferred securities and deferrable interest subordinated debt (not to exceed 15% of total capitalization), (ii) a restriction on sales or other dispositions of assets, other than certain sales and dispositions, and (iii) a restriction on the incurrence of liens on the assets of a borrower or any of its significant subsidiaries other than permitted liens. The absence of a material adverse change in the borrowers business, property, and results of operations or financial condition is not a condition to the availability of credit under the facility. The facility does not include any rating triggers. In November 2008, PHI entered into a second credit facility in the amount of $400 million with a syndicate of nine lenders. Under the facility, PHI may obtain revolving loans and swingline loans over the term of the facility, which expires on November 6, 2009. The facility does not provide for the issuance of letters of credit. All indebtedness incurred under the facility is unsecured. The interest rate payable on funds borrowed under the facility is, at PHIs election, based on either (a) the prevailing Eurodollar rate or (b) the highest of (i) the prevailing prime rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% or (iii) the one month Eurodollar rate plus 1.0%, plus a margin that varies according to the credit rating of PHI. Under the swingline loan sub facility, PHI may obtain loans for up to seven days in an aggregate principal amount which does not exceed 10% of the aggregate borrowing limit under the facility. In order to obtain loans under the facility, PHI must be in compliance with the same covenants and conditions that it is required to satisfy for utilization of the primary credit facility. The absence of a material adverse 78 PEPCO HOLDINGS change in PHIs business, property, and results of operations or financial condition is not a condition to the availability of credit under the facility. The facility does not include any ratings triggers. Typically, PHI and its utility subsidiaries issue commercial paper if required to meet their short term working capital requirements. Given the recent lack of liquidity in the commercial paper markets, however, the companies have borrowed under the primary credit facility to maintain sufficient cash on hand to meet daily short term operating needs. As of December 31, 2008, PHI had an outstanding loan of $50 million and Pepco had an outstanding loan of $100 million under the facility. In January 2009, PHI borrowed an additional $150 million under the facility. Cash and Credit Facilities Available as of December 31, 2008 Consolidated PHI PHI Parent Utility Subsidiaries Credit Facilities (Total Capacity) $ 1,900 $ 1,275 $ 625 Borrowings under Credit Facilities (150) (50) (100) Letters of Credit (566) (561) (5) Commercial Paper Outstanding Remaining Credit Facilities Available 1,184 664 520 Cash Invested in Money Market Funds (a) 343 20 323 Total Cash and Credit Facilities Available $ 1,527 $ 684 $ 843 (a) Cash and cash equivalents reported on the Balance Sheet total $384 million, which includes the $343 million invested in money market funds and $41 million held in cash and uncollected funds. During the months of January and February 2009, the total cash and credit facilities available to PHI on a consolidated basis ranged from a low of $1.1 billion to a high of $1.7 billion, and averaged $1.4 billion. The total cash and credit facilities available to the utility subsidiaries collectively ranged from a low of $673 million to a high of $1 billion, and averaged $831 million. Cash Flow Activity PHIs cash flows for 2008, 2007, and 2006 are summarized below. Cash Source (Use) 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars) Operating Activities $ 413 $ 795 $ 203 Investing Activities (714) (582) (230) Financing Activities 630 (207) (46) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 329 $ 6 $ (73) 79 PEPCO HOLDINGS Operating Activities Cash flows from operating activities are summarized below for 2008, 2007, and 2006. Cash Source (Use) 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars) Net Income $ 300 $ 334 $ 248 Non cash adjustments to net income 1,073 382 613 Changes in working capital (960) 79 (658) Net cash from operating activities $ 413 $ 795 $ 203 Net cash from operating activities was $382 million lower for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. In addition to a $34 million decrease in net income, the primary contributor was a $336 million increase in cash collateral requirements associated with Competitive Energy activities. The cash collateral requirements of the Competitive Energy businesses fluctuate significantly based on changes in energy market prices. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the combined net cash collateral positions of the Pepco Energy Services and Conectiv Energy businesses were net cash posted of $331 million and $90 million, respectively. As energy prices have declined in the second half of 2008, the collateral that the Competitive Energy businesses have been required to post has increased substantially. In addition, the transfer by Pepco of the Panda PPA to Sempra Energy Trading LLC had an impact on 2008 cash flows from operating activities. Non cash adjustments to net income reflect the change in restricted cash equivalents used to make the payment and changes in working capital include the reduction in the regulatory liability established to help offset future above market capacity and energy purchase costs. Net cash from operating activities in 2007 was $592 million higher than in 2006. In addition to an increase in net income, the factors that primarily contributed to the increase were: (i) a decrease of $203 million in taxes paid in 2007, partially attributable to a tax payment of $121 million made in February 2006 in connection with an unresolved tax matter (see Note (16), Commitments and Contingencies Regulatory and Other Matters IRS Mixed Service Cost Issue to the consolidated financial statements of PHI set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10 K), (ii) a decrease in cash collateral requirements associated with Competitive Energy activities, and (iii) the receipt of the proceeds of the Mirant bankruptcy settlement, of which $399 million was designated as operating cash flows and $15 million was designated as investing cash flows. 80 PEPCO HOLDINGS Investing Activities Cash flows used by investing activities during 2008, 2007, and 2006 are summarized below. Cash (Use) Source 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars) Construction expenditures $ (781) $ (623) $ (475) Cash proceeds from sale of other assets 56 11 182 All other investing cash flows, net 11 30 63 Net cash used by investing activities $ (714) $ (582) $ (230) Net cash used by investing activities increased $132 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was due primarily to (i) $158 million increase in capital expenditures, of which $96 million was attributable to Conectiv Energy and $33 million was attributable to Power Delivery, and (ii) the receipt by Pepco in 2007 of the proceeds of the Mirant bankruptcy settlement of which $15 million was designated as a reimbursement of certain investments in property, plant and equipment, offset by (iii) an increase of $45 million in cash proceeds from the sale of assets. The increase in Conectiv Energy capital expenditures was primarily due to the construction of new generation plants. The increase in Power Delivery capital expenditures was primarily attributable to capital costs associated with new customer services, distribution reliability, and transmission. The proceeds from the sale of assets in 2008 consisted primarily of $54 million received from DPLs sale of its Virginia retail electric distribution assets and wholesale electric transmission assets. Proceeds from the sale of assets in 2007 consisted primarily of $9 million received from the sale by ACE of the B.L. England generating facility. Net cash used by investing activities in 2007 was $352 million higher than in 2006 primarily due to: (i) a $148 million increase in capital expenditures, $107 million of which relates to Power Delivery, and (ii) a decrease of $171 million in cash proceeds from the sale of property. The increase in Power Delivery capital expenditures is primarily due to major transmission projects and new substations for Pepco and ACE. The proceeds from the sale of other assets in 2006 consisted primarily of $175 million from the sale of ACEs interest in the Keystone and Conemaugh generating facilities. Proceeds from the sale of other assets in 2007 consisted primarily of $9 million received from the sale of the B.L. England generating facility. Cash flows from investing activities in 2007 also include $15 million of the net settlement proceeds received by Pepco in the Mirant bankruptcy settlement that were specifically designated as a reimbursement of certain investments in property, plant and equipment. 81 PEPCO HOLDINGS Financing Activities Cash flows used by financing activities during 2008, 2007 and 2006 are summarized below. Cash (Use) Source 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars) Dividends paid on common and preferred stock $ (222) $ (203) $ (199) Common stock issued through the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) 29 28 30 Issuance of common stock 287 200 17 Redemption of preferred stock of subsidiaries (18) (22) Issuances of long term debt 1,150 704 515 Reacquisition of long term debt (590) (855) (578) Issuances (repayments) of short term debt, net 26 (61) 193 Cost of issuances (30) (7) (6) All other financing cash flows, net (20) 5 4 Net cash provided by (used by) financing activities $ 630 $ (207) $ (46) Net cash provided by financing activities in 2008 was $837 million higher than in 2007. Net cash used by financing activities in 2007 was $161 million higher than in 2006. Common Stock Dividends Common stock dividend payments were $222 million in 2008, $203 million in 2007, and $198 million in 2006. The increase in common dividends paid in 2008 was the result of additional shares outstanding (primarily from PHIs sale of 6.5 million shares of common stock in November 2007) and a quarterly dividend increase from 26 cents per share to 27 cents per share beginning in the first quarter of 2008. The increase in common dividends paid in 2007 was due to the issuance of the additional shares under the DRP. Changes in Outstanding Common Stock In November 2008, PHI sold 16.1 million shares of common stock in a registered offering at a price per share of $16.50, resulting in gross proceeds of $265 million. In November 2007, PHI sold 6.5 million shares of common stock in a registered offering at a price per share of $27.00, resulting in gross proceeds of $176 million. Under the DRP, PHI issued approximately 1.3 million shares of common stock in 2008, approximately 1 million shares of common stock in 2007 and approximately 1.2 million shares of common stock in 2006. Changes in Outstanding Preferred Stock Cash flows from the redemption of preferred stock in 2008, 2007 and 2006 are summarized in the chart below. 82 PEPCO HOLDINGS Preferred Stock Redemptions Redemption Price Shares Redeemed Aggregate Redemption Costs for years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars) DPL Redeemable Serial Preferred Stock 4.0% Series of 1943, $100 per share par value $105.00 19,809 $ $ 2 $ 3.7% Series of 1947, $100 per share par value $104.00 39,866 4 4.28% Series of 1949, $100 per share par value $104.00 28,460 3 4.56% Series of 1952, $100 per share par value $105.00 19,571 2 4.20% Series of 1955, $100 per share par value $103.00 25,404 2 5.0% Series of 1956, $100 per share par value $104.00 48,588 5 $ $ 18 $ Pepco Serial Preferred Stock $2.44 Series of 1957 $51.00 216,846 $ $ $ 11 $2.46 Series of 1958 $51.00 99,789 5 $2.28 Series of 1965 $51.00 112,709 6 $ $ $ 22 $ $ 18 $ 22 Changes in Outstanding Long Term Debt Cash flows from the issuance and redemption of long term debt in 2008, 2007 and 2006 are summarized in the charts below. 2008 2007 2006 Issuances (Millions of dollars) PHI 6.0% unsecured notes due 2019 $ $ 200 $ 6.125% unsecured notes due 2017 250 5.9% unsecured notes due 2016 200 450 200 Pepco 6.5% senior notes due 2037 (a) 250 Auction rate tax exempt bonds due 2022 (a) 110 6.5% senior notes due 2037 (a) 250 7.9% first mortgage bonds due 2038 250 500 250 110 DPL 6.4% first mortgage bonds due 2013 250 5.22% unsecured notes due 2016 100 250 (b) 100 ACE 5.8% senior notes due 2036 (a) 105 7.75% first mortgage bonds due 2018 250 250 105 Pepco Energy Services 4 $ 1,000 (b) $ 704 $ 515 (a) Secured by an outstanding series of First Mortgage Bonds.

See Purchase of Tax Exempt Auction Rate Bonds below. Purchase of Tax Exempt Auction Rate Bonds The redemptions in 2008 shown below include the purchase at par by PHI subsidiaries of $276 million in aggregate principal amount of insured tax exempt auction rate bonds issued by municipal authorities for the benefit of the respective PHI subsidiaries. These purchases were made in response to disruption in the market for municipal auction rate securities that made it 84 PEPCO HOLDINGS difficult for the remarketing agent to successfully remarket the bonds. These bond purchases consisted of the following: The purchase by Pepco of Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds issued by the Maryland Economic Development Corporation of an aggregate principal amount of $110 million. The purchase by DPL of Exempt Facilities Refunding Revenue Bonds issued by The Delaware Economic Development Authority in the aggregate principal amount of $112 million. The purchase by ACE of (i) Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds issued by Cape May County in the aggregate principal amount of $32 million and (ii) Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds issued by Salem County in the aggregate principal amount of $23 million. The obligations of the PHI subsidiaries with respect to these tax exempt bonds are considered to be extinguished for accounting purposes; however, each of the companies continues to hold the bonds, while monitoring the market and evaluating the options for reselling the bonds to the public at some time in the future. Changes in Short Term Debt Due to the recent capital and credit market disruptions, the market for commercial paper in 2008 has been severely restricted for most companies. As a result, PHI and its subsidiaries have not been able to issue commercial paper on a day to day basis either in amounts or with maturities that they have typically required for cash management purposes. Given their restricted access to the commercial paper market and the general uncertainty in the credit markets, PHI and each of its utility subsidiaries borrowed under the primary credit facility to create a cash reserve for future short term operating needs. As of December 31, 2008, PHI had a loan of $50 million outstanding and Pepco had a loan of $100 million outstanding under this facility. In January 2009, PHI borrowed an additional $150 million under this facility. In March 2008, DPL obtained a $150 million unsecured bank loan that matures in July 2009. Interest on the loan is calculated at a variable rate. In May 2008, Pepco obtained a $25 million bank loan that matures on April 30, 2009. Interest on the loan is calculated at a variable rate. The following insured Variable Rate Demand Bonds (VRDBs) repurchased in 2008 by The Bank of New York Mellon, as bond trustee, were tendered to the trustee by the holders in accordance with the terms of the VRDBs for purchase at par: $17 million of Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds 1997 Series A issued by Salem County for the benefit of ACE, and $5 million of Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds 1997 Series B issued by Salem County for the benefit of ACE. 85 PEPCO HOLDINGS The purchase of these VRDBs was financed by The Bank of New York Mellon under Standby Bond Purchase Agreements for the respective series. If these VRDBs cannot be remarketed by the remarketing agent prior to the first anniversary of the purchase of the VRDBs by the bond trustee, ACE will be obligated to redeem 1/10th of the principal amount of each series of VRDBs held by the bond trustee every six months thereafter. While the VRDBs are held by the bond trustee, ACE is obligated to pay interest on such bonds at a rate equal to the prime rate or LIBOR plus 50 basis points. In November 2008, DPL repurchased $9 million of Variable Rate Demand Bonds due 2024. In 2007, PHI redeemed a total of $36 million in short term debt with cash from operations. In 2006, Pepco and DPL issued short term debt of $67 million and $91 million, respectively, in order to cover capital expenditures and tax obligations throughout the year. Sale of Virginia Retail Electric Distribution and Wholesale Transmission Assets In January 2008, DPL completed (i) the sale of its retail electric distribution assets on the Eastern Shore of Virginia to A&N Electric Cooperative for a purchase price of approximately $49 million, after closing adjustments, and (ii) the sale of its wholesale electric transmission assets located on the Eastern Shore of Virginia to Old Dominion Electric Cooperative for a purchase price of approximately $5 million, after closing adjustments. Sales of ACE Generating Facilities On September 1, 2006, ACE completed the sale of its interest in the Keystone and Conemaugh generating facilities for $175 million (after giving effect to post closing adjustments). On February 8, 2007, ACE completed the sale of the B.L. England generating facility for a price of $9 million and in February 2008, ACE received an additional $4 million in an arbitration settlement relating to the sale. For a discussion of the accounting treatment of the gains from these sales, see Note (7), Regulatory Assets and Regulatory Liabilities, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Sale of Interest in Cogeneration Joint Venture During the first quarter of 2006, Conectiv Energy recognized a $12 million pre tax gain ($8 million after tax) on the sale of its equity interest in a joint venture which owns a wood burning cogeneration facility. Proceeds from Settlement of Mirant Bankruptcy Claims On September 5, 2008, Pepco transferred the Panda PPA to Sempra Energy Trading LLC (Sempra), along with a payment to Sempra, terminating all further rights, obligations and liabilities of Pepco under the Panda PPA. The use of the damages received from Mirant to offset above market costs of energy and capacity under the Panda PPA and to make the payment to Sempra reduced the balance of proceeds from the Mirant settlement to approximately $102 million as of December 31, 2008. 86 PEPCO HOLDINGS In November 2008, Pepco filed with the District of Columbia Public Service Commission (DCPSC) and the MPSC proposals to share with customers the remaining balance of proceeds from the Mirant settlement in accordance with divestiture sharing formulas previously approved by the respective commissions. Under Pepcos proposals, District of Columbia and Maryland customers would receive a total of approximately $25 million and $29 million, respectively. On December 12, 2008, the DCPSC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking concerning the sharing of the Mirant divestiture proceeds, including the bankruptcy settlement proceeds. The public comment period for the proposed rules has expired without any comments being submitted. This matter remains pending before the DCPSC. On February 17, 2009, Pepco, the Maryland Office of Peoples Counsel (the Maryland OPC) and the MPSC staff filed a settlement agreement with the MPSC. The settlement, among other things, provides that of the remaining balance of the Mirant settlement, Pepco shall distribute $39 million to its Maryland customers through a one time billing credit. If the settlement is approved by the MPSC, Pepco currently estimates that it will result in a pre tax gain in the range of $15 million to $20 million, which will be recorded when the MPSC issues its final order approving the settlement. Pending the final disposition of these funds, the remaining $102 million in proceeds from the Mirant settlement is being accounted for as restricted cash and as a regulatory liability. Capital Requirements Capital Expenditures Pepco Holdings total capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2008 totaled $781 million of which $587 million was incurred by Power Delivery, $138 million was incurred by Conectiv Energy, $31 million was incurred by Pepco Energy Services and $25 million was incurred by Corporate and Other. The Power Delivery expenditures were primarily related to capital costs associated with new customer services, distribution reliability, and transmission. The table below shows the projected capital expenditures for Power Delivery, Conectiv Energy, Pepco Energy Services and Corporate and Other for the five year period 2009 through 2013. For the Year 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Total (Millions of Dollars) Power Delivery Distribution $ 407 $ 401 $ 433 $ 496 $ 532 $ 2,269 Distribution Blueprint for the Future 47 71 5 112 87 322 Transmission 143 183 249 200 204 979 Transmission MAPP 56 193 363 474 300 1,386 Gas Delivery 20 21 20 21 19 101 Other 41 52 61 57 38 249 Total for Power Delivery Business 714 921 1,131 1,360 1,180 5,306 Conectiv Energy 281 118 39 12 13 463 Pepco Energy Services 11 12 14 15 15 67 Corporate and Other 5 4 4 4 3 20 Total PHI $ 1,011 $ 1,055 $ 1,188 $ 1,391 $ 1,211 $ 5,856 87 PEPCO HOLDINGS Pepco Holdings expects to fund these expenditures through internally generated cash and external financing. Distribution, Transmission and Gas Delivery The projected capital expenditures listed in the table for distribution (other than Blueprint for the Future), transmission (other than the Mid Atlantic Power Pathway (MAPP)) and gas delivery are primarily for facility replacements and upgrades to accommodate customer growth and reliability. Blueprint for the Future During 2007, Pepco, DPL and ACE each announced an initiative that is referred to as the Blueprint for the Future. These initiatives combine traditional energy efficiency programs with new technologies and systems to help customers manage their energy use and reduce the total cost of energy. The programs include demand side management (DSM) efforts, such as rebates or other financial incentives for residential customers to replace inefficient appliances and for business customers to use more energy efficient equipment, such as improved lighting and HVAC systems. Under the programs, customers also could receive credits on their bills for allowing the utility company to cycle, or intermittently turn off, their central air conditioning or heat pumps when wholesale electricity prices are high. The programs contemplate that business customers would receive financial incentives for using energy efficient equipment, and would be rewarded for reducing use during periods of peak demand. Additionally, plans include the installation of smart meters for all customers in the District of Columbia, Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey, providing the utilities with the ability to remotely read the meters and identify the location of a power outage. Pepco, DPL and ACE have made filings with their respective regulatory commissions for approval of certain aspects of these programs. Delaware has approved a recovery mechanism associated with these plans, and work has proceeded to prepare for the installation of an Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) by the last quarter of 2009. On December 18, 2008, the DCPSC conditionally approved five DSM programs. The cost of these programs will be recovered through a rate surcharge. On December 31, 2008 the MPSC conditionally approved for both Pepco and DPL, four residential and four non residential DSM/energy efficiency programs. The MPSC will consider an AMI program in a separate proceeding. PHI anticipates that the costs of these programs will be recovered through a previously approved surcharge mechanism. MAPP Project In October 2007, the PJM Board of Managers approved PHIs proposed MAPP transmission project for construction of a new 230 mile, 500 kilovolt interstate transmission project at a then estimated cost of $1 billion. This MAPP project will originate at Possum Point substation in northern Virginia, connect into three substations across southern Maryland, cross the Chesapeake Bay, tie into two substations across the Delmarva Peninsula and terminate at Salem substation in southern New Jersey. This MAPP project is part of PJMs Regional Transmission Expansion Plan required to address the reliability objectives of the PJM RTO system. On December 4, 2008, the PJM Board approved a direct current technology for segments of the project including the Chesapeake Bay Crossing. With this modification, the cost of the MAPP project currently is estimated at $1.4 billion. PJM has determined that the line 88 PEPCO HOLDINGS segment from Possum Point substation to the second substation on the Delmarva Peninsula (Indian River substation) is required to be operational by June 1, 2013. PJM is continuing to evaluate the in service date for the remaining 80 miles of line segment to connect the Indian River substation to the Salem substation. Construction is expected to occur in sections over the next five year period. Delta Project In December 2007, Conectiv Energy announced a decision to construct a 545 megawatt natural gas and oil fired combined cycle electricity generation plant to be located in Peach Bottom Township, Pennsylvania (Delta Project). The total construction expenditures for the Delta Project are expected to be $470 million, of which $62 million was expended in 2008 and $63 million in 2007 for three combustion turbines. Projected expenditures of $230 million in 2009, $95 million in 2010, and $20 million in 2011 are included in Conectiv Energys projected capital expenditures shown in the table above. The plant is expected to become operational during the second quarter of 2011. Cumberland Project In 2007, Conectiv Energy began construction of a new 100 megawatt combustion turbine power plant in Millville, New Jersey. The total construction expenditures for this project are expected to be $75 million (of which $41 million and $23 million, respectively, were incurred in 2008 and 2007), with projected expenditures of $10 million in 2009. These future expenditures are included in Conectiv Energys projected capital expenditures shown in the table above. The plant is expected to become operational during the second quarter of 2009. Compliance with Delaware Multipollutant Regulations As required by the Delaware multipollutant emissions regulations adopted by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, PHI, in June 2007, filed a compliance plan for controlling nitrogen oxide (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and mercury emissions from its Edge Moor power plant. The plan includes installation of a sodium based sorbent injection system and a Selective Non Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) system and carbon injection for Edge Moor Units 3 and 4, and use of an SNCR system and lower sulfur oil at Edge Moor Unit 5. Conectiv Energy currently believes that with these modifications, it will be able to meet the requirements of the new regulations at an estimated capital cost of $81 million (of which $47 million was expended through December 2008) with projected expenditures of $18 million in 2009. Dividends Pepco Holdings annual dividend rate on its common stock is determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration, among other factors, current and possible future developments that may affect PHIs income and cash flows. In 2008, PHIs Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of 27 cents per share of common stock payable on March 31, 2008, June 30, 2008, September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2008. On January 22, 2009, the Board of Directors declared a dividend on common stock of 27 cents per share payable March 31, 2009, to shareholders of record on March 10, 2009. 89 PEPCO HOLDINGS PHI generates no operating income of its own. Accordingly, its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders depends on dividends received from its subsidiaries. In addition to their future financial performance, the ability of PHIs direct and indirect subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to limits imposed by: (i) state corporate and regulatory laws, which impose limitations on the funds that can be used to pay dividends and, in the case of regulatory laws, as applicable, may require the prior approval of the relevant utility regulatory commissions before dividends can be paid, (ii) the prior rights of holders of existing and future preferred stock, mortgage bonds and other long term debt issued by the subsidiaries, and any other restrictions imposed in connection with the incurrence of liabilities, and (iii) certain provisions of ACEs certificate of incorporation which provides that, if any preferred stock is outstanding, no dividends may be paid on the ACE common stock if, after payment, ACEs common stock capital plus surplus would be less than the involuntary liquidation value of the outstanding preferred stock. Pepco and DPL have no shares of preferred stock outstanding. Currently, the restriction in the ACE charter does not limit its ability to pay dividends. Pension Funding Pepco Holdings has a noncontributory retirement plan (the PHI Retirement Plan) that covers substantially all employees of Pepco, DPL and ACE and certain employees of other Pepco Holdings subsidiaries. As of the 2008 valuation, the PHI Retirement Plan satisfied the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) without requiring any additional funding. PHIs funding policy with regard to the PHI Retirement Plan is to maintain a funding level in excess of 100% of its accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and that is at least equal to the funding target as defined under the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The funding target under the Pension Protection Act is 100% of accrued liabilities phased in over time. The funding target was 92% for 2008 and is 94% of the accrued liability for 2009. In 2008 and 2007, no contributions were made to the PHI Retirement Plan. In 2008, the ABO for the PHI Retirement Plan decreased to $1.57 billion from $1.59 billion in 2007, due to an increase in the discount rate from 6.25% to 6.50%. The PHI Retirement Plan assets experienced a negative return of 24% in 2008, below the 8.25% level assumed in the valuation. As a result of the combination of these factors, the funding level at year end 2008 was below both 100% of the ABO and the funding target for January 1, 2009. Although PHI projects there will be no minimum funding requirement for 2009 under the Pension Protection Act, PHI expects to make a discretionary tax deductible contribution of approximately $300 million to bring its plan assets to at least the funding target level for 2009 under the Pension Protection Act. For additional discussion of PHIs Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, see Note (10), Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 90 PEPCO HOLDINGS Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Summary information about Pepco Holdings consolidated contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2008, is as follows: Contractual Maturity Obligation Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years (Millions of dollars) Variable rate demand bonds $ 118 $ 118 $ $ $ Stand by bond purchase agreement 22 22 Bank loans and credit facility loans 325 325 Commercial paper Long term debt (a) 5,357 82 602 1,345 3,328 Long term project funding 21 2 4 4 11 Interest payments on debt 4,049 320 609 523 2,597 Capital leases 167 15 30 30 92 Liabilities and accrued interest related to effectively settled and uncertain tax positions 165 37 7 121 Operating leases 591 56 119 47 369 Pension and OPEB plan contributions 339 339 Non derivative fuel and purchase power contracts 9,067 3,211 2,902 729 2,225 Total $ 20,221 $ 4,527 $ 4,266 $ 2,685 $ 8,743 (a) Includes transition bonds issued by ACE Funding. Third Party Guarantees, Indemnifications and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements For a discussion of PHIs third party guarantees, indemnifications, obligations and off balance sheet arrangements, see Note (16), Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 91 PEPCO HOLDINGS Energy Contract Net Asset/Liability Activity The following table provides detail on changes in the net asset or liability position of the Competitive Energy businesses (consisting of the activities of the Conectiv Energy and Pepco Energy Services segments) with respect to energy commodity contracts from one period to the next: Roll forward of Fair Value Energy Contract Net Assets (Liabilities) For the Year Ended December 31, 2008 (Dollars are pre tax and in millions) Energy Commodity Activities (a) Total Fair Value Energy Contract Net Assets at December 31, 2007 $ 18 Total change in unrealized fair value 83 Less: Reclassification to realized at settlement of contracts (97) Effective portion of changes in fair value recorded in Other Comprehensive Income (315) Cash flow hedge ineffectiveness recorded in earnings (3) Total Fair Value Energy Contract Net Liabilities at December 31, 2008 $ (314) Detail of Fair Value Energy Contract Net Liabilities at December 31, 2008 (see above) Total Current Assets (unrealized gains derivative contracts) $ 126 Noncurrent Assets (other assets) 13 Total Fair Value Energy Contract Assets 139 Current Liabilities (other current liabilities) (367) Noncurrent Liabilities (other liabilities) (86) Total Fair Value Energy Contract Liabilities (453) Total Fair Value Energy Contract Net Liabilities $ (314) (a) Includes all SFAS No. 133 hedge activity and trading activities recorded at fair value through Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) or on the Statements of Earnings, as required. The $314 million net liability on energy contracts at December 31, 2008 was primarily attributable to losses on power swaps and natural gas futures and swaps designated as hedges of future energy purchases or production under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133. Prices of electricity and natural gas declined during the second half of 2008, which resulted in unrealized losses on the energy contracts of the Competitive Energy businesses. These businesses recorded unrealized losses of $315 million on energy contracts in Other Comprehensive Income as these energy contracts were effective hedges under SFAS No. 133. When these energy contracts settle, the related realized gains or losses are expected to be largely offset by the realized loss or gain on future energy purchases or production that will be used to settle the sales obligations of the Competitive Energy businesses to their customers. 92 PEPCO HOLDINGS PHI uses its best estimates to determine the fair value of the commodity and derivative contracts that its Competitive Energy businesses hold and sell. The fair values in each category presented below reflect forward prices and volatility factors as of December 31, 2008 and are subject to change as a result of changes in these factors: Maturity and Source of Fair Value of Energy Contract Net Assets (Liabilities) As of December 31, 2008 (Dollars are pre tax and in millions) Fair Value of Contracts at December 31, 2008 Maturities Source of Fair Value 2009 2010 2011 2012 and Beyond Total Fair Value Energy Commodity Activities, net(a) Actively Quoted (i.e., exchange traded) prices $ (47) $ (48) $ (5) $ (2) $ (102) Prices provided by other external sources (b) (138) (56) (11) (9) (214) Modeled (c) 2 2 (4) 2 2 Total $ (183) $ (102) $ (20) $ (9) $ (314) (a) Includes all SFAS No. 133 hedge activity and trading activities recorded at fair value through AOCI or on the Statements of Earnings, as required. (b) Prices provided by other external sources reflect information obtained from over the counter brokers, industry services, or multiple party on line platforms that is readily observable in the market. (c) Modeled values include significant inputs, usually representing more than 10% of the valuation, not readily observable in the market. The modeled valuation above represents the fair valuation of certain long dated power transactions based on limited observable broker prices extrapolated for periods beyond two years into the future. Contractual Arrangements with Credit Rating Triggers or Margining Rights Under certain contractual arrangements entered into by PHIs subsidiaries in connection with Competitive Energy business and other transactions, the subsidiary may be required to provide cash collateral or letters of credit as security for its contractual obligations if the credit ratings of the subsidiary are downgraded. In the event of a downgrade, the amount required to be posted would depend on the amount of the underlying contractual obligation existing at the time of the downgrade. Based on contractual provisions in effect at December 31, 2008, a one level downgrade in the unsecured debt credit ratings of PHI and each of its rated subsidiaries, which would decrease PHIs rating to below investment grade, would increase the collateral obligation of PHI and its subsidiaries by up to $462 million. PHI believes that it and its utility subsidiaries currently have sufficient liquidity to fund their operations and meet their financial obligations. Many of the contractual arrangements entered into by PHIs subsidiaries in connection with Competitive Energy and Default Electricity Supply activities include margining rights pursuant to which the PHI subsidiary or a counterparty may request collateral if the market value of the contractual obligations reaches levels in excess of the credit thresholds established in the applicable arrangements. Pursuant to these margining rights, the affected PHI subsidiary may 93 PEPCO HOLDINGS receive, or be required to post, collateral due to energy price movements. As of December 31, 2008, Pepco Holdings subsidiaries engaged in Competitive Energy activities and Default Electricity Supply activities provided net cash collateral in the amount of $365 million in connection with these activities. Environmental Remediation Obligations PHIs accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2008 include approximately $14 million, of which $6 million is expected to be incurred in 2009, for potential environmental cleanup and other costs related to sites at which an operating subsidiary is a potentially responsible party, is alleged to be a third party contributor, or has made a decision to clean up contamination on its own property. For information regarding projected expenditures for environmental control facilities, see Item 1 Business Environmental Matters, of this Form 10 K. The most significant environmental remediation obligations as of December 31, 2008, were: $4 million, of which $1 million is expected to be incurred in 2009, payable by DPL in accordance with a 2001 consent agreement reached with the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, for remediation, site restoration, natural resource damage compensatory projects and other costs associated with environmental contamination that resulted from an oil release at the Indian River power plant, which was sold in June 2001. $5 million in environmental remediation costs, of which $1 million is expected to be incurred in 2009, payable by Conectiv Energy associated with the Deepwater generating facility. Less than $1 million for environmental remediation costs related to former manufactured gas plant operations at a Cambridge, Maryland site on DPL owned property, adjacent property and the adjacent Cambridge Creek, all of which is expected to be incurred in 2009. $2 million, constituting Pepcos liability for a remedy at the Metal Bank/Cottman Avenue site. $2 million, most of which is expected to be incurred in 2009, payable by DPL in connection with the Wilmington Coal Gas South site located in Wilmington, Delaware, to remediate residual material from the historical operation of a manufactured gas plant. Less than $1 million, of which a small portion is expected to be incurred in 2009, payable by Pepco for long term monitoring associated with a pipeline oil release that occurred in 2000. Sources of Capital Pepco Holdings sources to meet its long term funding needs, such as capital expenditures, dividends, and new investments, and its short term funding needs, such as working capital and the temporary funding of long term funding needs, include internally generated funds, securities issuances and bank financing under new or existing facilities. PHIs ability to 94 PEPCO HOLDINGS generate funds from its operations and to access capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties. Volatile and deteriorating financial market conditions, diminished liquidity and tightening credit may affect efficient access to certain of PHIs potential funding sources. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10 K, for additional discussion of important factors that may impact these sources of capital. Internally Generated Cash The primary source of Pepco Holdings internally generated funds is the cash flow generated by its regulated utility subsidiaries in the Power Delivery business. Additional sources of funds include cash flow generated from its non regulated subsidiaries and the sale of non core assets. Short Term Funding Sources Pepco Holdings and its regulated utility subsidiaries have traditionally used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs, such as commercial paper, short term notes and bank lines of credit. Proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs but may also be used to fund temporarily long term capital requirements. Pepco Holdings maintains an ongoing commercial paper program of up to $875 million. Pepco and DPL have ongoing commercial paper programs of up to $500 million, and ACE up to $250 million. The commercial paper can be issued with maturities of up to 270 days. Due to the recent capital and credit market disruptions, however, the market for commercial paper has been severely restricted for most companies. As a result, PHI and its subsidiaries have not been able to issue commercial paper on a day to day basis either in amounts or with maturities that they have typically required for cash management purposes. A further description of the existence and availability of the sources of short term funding, and the impact of the ongoing capital and credit market disruptions, is set forth above under the headings Impact of the Current Capital and Credit Market Disruptions Collateral Requirements of the Competitive Energy Businesses and Credit Facilities. Long Term Funding Sources The sources of long term funding for PHI and its subsidiaries are the issuance of debt and equity securities and borrowing under long term credit agreements. Proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements, such as capital expenditures and new investments, and to repay or refinance existing indebtedness. Regulatory Restrictions on Financing Activities The issuance of debt securities by PHIs principal subsidiaries requires approval of either FERC or one or more state public utility commissions. Neither FERC approval nor state public utility commission approval is required as a condition to the issuance of securities by PHI. State Financing Authority Pepcos long term financing activities (including the issuance of securities and the incurrence of debt) are subject to authorization by the DCPSC and MPSC. DPLs long term financing activities are subject to authorization by MPSC and the Delaware Public Service 95 PEPCO HOLDINGS Commission (DPSC). ACEs long term and short term (consisting of debt instruments with a maturity of one year or less) financing activities are subject to authorization by the NJBPU. Each utility, through periodic filings with the state public service commission(s) having jurisdiction over its financing activities, typically seeks to maintain standing authority sufficient to cover its projected financing needs over a multi year period. FERC Financing Authority Under the Federal Power Act (FPA), FERC has jurisdiction over the issuance of long term and short term securities of public utilities, but only if the issuance is not regulated by the state public utility commission in which the public utility is organized and operating. Under these provisions, FERC has jurisdiction over the issuance of short term debt by Pepco and DPL. Pepco and DPL have obtained FERC authority for the issuance of short term debt. Because Conectiv Energy and Pepco Energy Services also qualify as public utilities under the FPA and are not regulated by a state utility commission, FERC also has jurisdiction over the issuance of securities by those companies. Conectiv Energy and Pepco Energy Services have obtained the requisite FERC financing authority in their respective market based rate orders. Money Pool Pepco Holdings operates a system money pool, or an intra system cash management program under a blanket authorization adopted by FERC. The money pool is a cash management mechanism used by Pepco Holdings to manage the short term investment and borrowing requirements of its subsidiaries that participate in the money pool. Pepco Holdings may invest in but not borrow from the money pool. Eligible subsidiaries with surplus cash may deposit those funds in the money pool. Deposits in the money pool are guaranteed by Pepco Holdings. Eligible subsidiaries with cash requirements may borrow from the money pool. Borrowings from the money pool are unsecured. Depositors in the money pool receive, and borrowers from the money pool pay, an interest rate based primarily on Pepco Holdings short term borrowing rate. Pepco Holdings deposits funds in the money pool to the extent that the pool has insufficient funds to meet the borrowing needs of its participants, which may require Pepco Holdings to borrow funds for deposit from external sources. REGULATORY AND OTHER MATTERS For a discussion of material pending matters such as regulatory and legal proceedings, and other commitments and contingencies, see Note (16), Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES General Pepco Holdings has identified the following accounting policies, including certain estimates, that as a result of the judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved, could result in material changes in its financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions. Pepco Holdings has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 96 PEPCO HOLDINGS Goodwill Impairment Evaluation PHI believes that the estimates involved in its goodwill impairment evaluation process represent Critical Accounting Estimates because they are subjective and susceptible to change from period to period as management makes assumptions and judgments and the impact of a change in assumptions could be material to financial results. Substantially all of PHIs goodwill was generated by Pepcos acquisition of Conectiv in 2002 and is allocated to the Power Delivery reporting unit for purposes of assessing impairment under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142). Management has identified Power Delivery as a single reporting unit based on the aggregation of components. The first step of the goodwill impairment test under SFAS No. 142 compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. Management uses its best judgment to make reasonable projections of future cash flows for Power Delivery when estimating the reporting units fair value. In addition, PHI selects a discount rate for the associated risk with those estimated cash flows. These judgments are inherently uncertain, and actual results could vary from those used in PHIs estimates. The impact of such variations could significantly alter the results of a goodwill impairment test, which could materially impact the estimated fair value of Power Delivery and potentially the amount of any impairment recorded in the financial statements. PHI tests its goodwill for impairment annually as of July 1, and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Factors that may result in an interim impairment test include, but are not limited to: a change in identified reporting units; an adverse change in business conditions; a protracted decline in stock price causing market capitalization to fall below book value; an adverse regulatory action; or impairment of long lived assets in the reporting unit. PHIs July 1, 2008 annual impairment test indicated that its goodwill was not impaired. PHI performed an interim test of goodwill for impairment at December 31, 2008 as its market capitalization was below its book value for a significant part of the fourth quarter of 2008, and it concluded that its goodwill was not impaired. Details about the interim test at year end and the results are included in Note (6), Goodwill, in PHIs consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. In order to estimate the fair value of the Power Delivery reporting unit, PHI reviews the results from two discounted cash flow models. The models differ in the method used to calculate the terminal value of the reporting unit. One estimate of terminal value is based on a constant, annual cash flow growth rate that is consistent with Power Deliverys plan, and the other estimate of terminal value is based on a multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization that management believes is consistent with relevant market multiples for comparable utilities. Each model uses a cost of capital appropriate for a regulated utility as the discount rate for the estimated cash flows associated with the reporting unit. Neither valuation model evidenced impairment of goodwill. PHI has consistently used this valuation model to estimate the fair value of Power Delivery since the adoption of SFAS No. 142. The estimation of fair value is dependent on a number of factors, including but not limited to interest rates, growth assumptions, assumptions about regulatory ratemaking 97 PEPCO HOLDINGS proceedings, operating and capital expenditure requirements and other factors, changes in which could materially impact the results of impairment testing. Assumptions and methodologies used in the models were consistent with historical experience. A hypothetical 10 percent decrease in fair value of the Power Delivery reporting unit at December 31, 2008 would not have resulted in the Power Delivery reporting unit failing the first step of the impairment test as defined in SFAS No. 142. Sensitive, interrelated and uncertain variables that could decrease the estimated fair value of the Power Delivery reporting unit include utility sector market performance, sustained adverse business conditions, the results of rate making proceedings, higher operating and capital expenditure requirements, a significant increase in the cost of capital and other factors. Long Lived Assets Impairment Evaluation Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in its long lived asset impairment evaluation process represent Critical Accounting Estimates because (i) they are highly susceptible to change from period to period because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about undiscounted and discounted future cash flows and fair values, which are inherently uncertain, (ii) actual results could vary from those used in Pepco Holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material, and (iii) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on Pepco Holdings assets as well as the net loss related to an impairment charge could be material. SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, requires that certain long lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss may only be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. The asset is deemed not to be recoverable when its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. In order to estimate an assets future cash flows, Pepco Holdings considers historical cash flows. Pepco Holdings uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel costs, legislative initiatives, and operating costs. If necessary, the process of determining fair value is done consistent with the process described in assessing the fair value of goodwill discussed above. Accounting for Derivatives Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in accounting for its derivative instruments represent Critical Accounting Estimates because (i) the fair value of the instruments are highly susceptible to changes in market value and or interest rate fluctuations, (ii) there are significant uncertainties in modeling techniques used to measure fair value in certain circumstances, (iii) actual results could vary from those used in Pepco Holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material, and (iv) changes in fair values and market prices could result in material impacts to Pepco Holdings assets, liabilities, other comprehensive income (loss), and results of operations. See Note (2), Significant Accounting Policies Accounting for Derivatives, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for information on PHIs accounting for derivatives. Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments primarily to manage risk associated with commodity prices and interest rates. SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative 98 PEPCO HOLDINGS Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, governs the accounting treatment for derivatives and requires that derivative instruments be measured at fair value. The fair value of derivatives is determined using quoted exchange prices where available. For instruments that are not traded on an exchange, external broker quotes are used to determine fair value. For some custom and complex instruments, internal models are used to interpolate broker quality price information. For certain long dated instruments, broker or exchange data is extrapolated for future periods where limited market information is available. Models are also used to estimate volumes for certain transactions. The same valuation methods are used to determine the value of non derivative, commodity exposure for risk management purposes. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in reporting the costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefits represent Critical Accounting Estimates because (i) they are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of assumptions which are subjective in nature, (ii) they are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience, and (iii) changes in assumptions could impact Pepco Holdings expected future cash funding requirements for the plans and would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations, and the reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost on the income statement. Assumptions about the future, including the expected return on plan assets, discount rate applied to benefit obligations, the anticipated rate of increase in health care costs and participant compensation have a significant impact on employee benefit costs. In terms of quantifying the anticipated impact of a change in the critical assumptions while holding all other assumptions constant, Pepco Holdings estimates that a .25% decrease in the discount rate used to value the benefit obligations could result in a $7 million increase in net periodic benefit cost. Additionally, Pepco Holdings estimates that a .25% reduction in the expected return on plan assets could result in a $6 million increase in net periodic benefit cost. A 1.0% increase in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate could result in a $2 million increase net periodic benefit cost. In addition to its impact on cost, a .25% decrease in the discount rate would increase PHIs projected pension benefit obligation by $60 million and would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $18 million at December 31, 2008. Pepco Holdings management consults with its actuaries and investment consultants when selecting its plan assumptions, and benchmarks its critical assumptions against other corporate plans. The impact of changes in assumptions and the difference between actual and expected or estimated results on pension and postretirement obligations is generally recognized over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans rather than immediately recognized in the statements of earnings. For additional discussion, see Note (10), Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Regulation of Power Delivery Operations The requirements of SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, apply to the Power Delivery businesses of Pepco, DPL, and ACE. Pepco Holdings believes that the judgment involved in accounting for its regulated activities 99 PEPCO HOLDINGS represent Critical Accounting Estimates because (i) a significant amount of judgment is required (including but not limited to the interpretation of laws and regulatory commission orders) to assess the probability of the recovery of regulatory assets, (ii) actual results and interpretations could vary from those used in Pepco Holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material, and (iii) the impact that writing off a regulatory asset would have on Pepco Holdings assets and the net loss related to the charge could be material. Unbilled Revenue Unbilled revenue represents an estimate of revenue earned from services rendered by Pepco Holdings utility operations that have not yet been billed. Pepco Holdings utility operations calculate unbilled revenue using an output based methodology. This methodology is based on the supply of electricity or gas distributed to customers. Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in its unbilled revenue process represent Critical Accounting Estimates because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about input factors such as customer sales mix and estimated power line losses (estimates of electricity expected to be lost in the process of its transmission and distribution to customers), all of which are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change from period to period, the impact of which could be material. Accounting for Income Taxes Pepco Holdings and the majority of its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. Pepco Holdings accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and effective January 1, 2007, adopted FIN 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. FIN 48 clarifies the criteria for recognition of tax benefits in accordance with SFAS No. 109, and prescribes a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Specifically, it clarifies that an entitys tax benefits must be more likely than not of being sustained assuming that position will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements. If the position drops below the more likely than not standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. Assumptions, judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes. Pepco Holdings assumptions, judgments and estimates take into account current tax laws, interpretation of current tax laws and the possible outcomes of current and future investigations conducted by tax authorities. Pepco Holdings has established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. Although Pepco Holdings believes that these assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or its interpretation of tax laws and the resolutions of the current and any future investigations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in the consolidated financial statements. Under SFAS No. 109, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded, representing future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Pepco Holdings evaluates quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and 100 PEPCO HOLDINGS the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or successfully implement tax planning strategies may affect the realization of deferred tax assets. New Accounting Standards and Pronouncements For information concerning new accounting standards and pronouncements that have recently been adopted by PHI and its subsidiaries or that one or more of the companies will be required to adopt on or before a specified date in the future, see Note (3), Newly Adopted Accounting Standards, and Note (4), Recently Issued Accounting Standards, Not Yet Adopted, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10 K.

Pepco provides Default Electricity Supply, which is the supply of electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its territories who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive supplier, in both the District of Columbia and Maryland. Default Electricity Supply is known as Standard Offer Service in both the District of Columbia and Maryland. Pepcos service territory covers approximately 640 square miles and has a population of approximately 2.1 million. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 57% of delivered electricity sales were to Maryland customers and approximately 43% were to Washington, D.C. customers. In connection with its approval of new electric service distribution base rates for Pepco in Maryland, effective in June, 2007 (the 2007 Maryland Rate Order), the Maryland Public Service Commission (MPSC) approved a bill stabilization adjustment mechanism (BSA) for retail customers. For customers to which the BSA applies, Pepco recognizes distribution revenue based on an approved distribution charge per customer. From a revenue recognition standpoint, the BSA thus decouples the distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period. This change in the reporting of distribution revenue has the effect of eliminating changes in retail customer usage (whether due to weather conditions, energy prices, energy efficiency programs or other reasons) as a factor having an impact on reported revenue. As a consequence, the only factors that will cause distribution revenue from retail customers in Maryland to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer. Pepco is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI or Pepco Holdings). Because PHI is a public utility holding company subject to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005), the relationship between PHI and Pepco and certain activities of Pepco are subject to the regulatory oversight of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under PUHCA 2005. IMPACT OF THE CURRENT CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKET DISRUPTIONS The recent disruptions in the capital and credit markets have had an impact on Pepcos business. While these conditions have required Pepco to make certain adjustments in its financial management activities, Pepco believes that it currently has sufficient liquidity to fund its operations and meet its financial obligations. These market conditions, should they continue, however, could have a negative effect on Pepcos financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 104 PEPCO Liquidity Requirements Pepco depends on access to the capital and credit markets to meet its liquidity and capital requirements. To meet its liquidity requirements, Pepco historically has relied on the issuance of commercial paper and short term notes and on bank lines of credit to supplement internally generated cash from operations. Pepcos primary credit source is PHIs $1.5 billion syndicated credit facility, under which Pepco can borrow funds, obtain letters of credit and support the issuance of commercial paper in an amount up to $500 million (subject to the limitation that the total utilization by Pepco and PHIs other utility subsidiaries cannot exceed $625 million). This facility is in effect until May 2012 and consists of commitments from 17 lenders, no one of which is responsible for more than 8.5% of the total commitment. Due to the recent capital and credit market disruptions, the market for commercial paper was severely restricted for most companies. As a result, Pepco has not been able to issue commercial paper on a day to day basis either in amounts or with maturities that it typically has required for cash management purposes. Given its restricted access to the commercial paper market and the uncertainty in the credit markets generally, Pepco borrowed $100 million under the credit facility to create a cash reserve for future short term operating needs at December 31, 2008. After giving effect to outstanding letters of credit and commercial paper, PHIs utility subsidiaries have an aggregate of $843 million in combined cash and borrowing capacity under the credit facility at December 31, 2008. During the months of January and February 2009, the average daily amount of the combined cash and borrowing capacity of PHIs utility subsidiaries was $831 million and ranged from a low of $673 million to a high of $1 billion. To address the challenges posed by the current capital and credit market environment and to ensure that it will continue to have sufficient access to cash to meet its liquidity needs, Pepco has identified a number of cash and liquidity conservation measures, including opportunities to defer capital expenditures due to lower than anticipated growth. Several measures to reduce expenditures have been taken. Additional measures could be undertaken if conditions warrant. Due to the financial market conditions, which have caused uncertainty of short term funding, Pepco issued $250 million in long term debt securities in December, with the proceeds used to refund short term debt incurred to finance utility construction and operations on a temporary basis and incurred to fund the temporary repurchase of tax exempt auction rate securities. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans Pepco participates in pension and postretirement benefit plans sponsored by PHI for its employees. While the plans have not experienced any significant impact in terms of liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the disruption of the capital and credit markets, the recent stock market declines have caused a decrease in the market value of benefit plan assets in 2008. Pepco expects to contribute approximately $170 million to the pension plan in 2009. 105 PEPCO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following results of operations discussion compares the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2007. Other than this disclosure, information under this item has been omitted in accordance with General Instruction I(2)(a) to the Form 10 K. All amounts in the tables (except sales and customers) are in millions of dollars. Operating Revenue 2008 2007 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 978 $ 928 $ 50 Default Supply Revenue 1,309 1,241 68 Other Electric Revenue 35 32 3 Total Operating Revenue $ 2,322 $ 2,201 $ 121 The table above shows the amount of Operating Revenue earned that is subject to price regulation (Regulated Transmission and Distribution (T&D) Electric Revenue and Default Supply Revenue) and that which is not subject to price regulation (Other Electric Revenue). Regulated T&D Electric Revenue includes revenue from the delivery of electricity, including the delivery of Default Electricity Supply, to Pepcos customers within its service territory at regulated rates. Regulated T&D Electric Revenue also includes transmission service revenue that Pepco receives as a transmission owner from PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM). Default Supply Revenue is the revenue received for Default Electricity Supply. The costs related to Default Electricity Supply are included in Fuel and Purchased Energy. Other Electric Revenue includes work and services performed on behalf of customers, including other utilities, which is not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of pole attachments, late payment fees, and collection fees. Regulated T&D Electric Regulated T&D Electric Revenue 2008 2007 Change Residential $ 259 $ 263 $ (4) Commercial 544 529 15 Industrial Other 175 136 39 Total Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 978 $ 928 $ 50 Other Regulated T&D Electric Revenue consists primarily of (i) transmission service revenue, (ii) revenue from the resale of energy and capacity under power purchase agreements between Pepco and unaffiliated third parties in the PJM Regional Transmission Organization (PJM RTO) market, and (iii) either (a) a positive adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from Maryland retail distribution sales falls short of the revenue that Pepco is entitled to earn based on the distribution charge per customer approved in the 2007 Maryland Rate Order or 106 PEPCO (b) a negative adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from such distribution sales exceeds the revenue that Pepco is entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer (a Revenue Decoupling Adjustment). Regulated T&D Electric Sales (Gigawatt hours(GWh)) 2008 2007 Change Residential 7,730 8,093 (363) Commercial 18,972 19,197 (225) Industrial Other 161 161 Total Regulated T&D Electric Sales 26,863 27,451 (588) Regulated T&D Electric Customers (in thousands) 2008 2007 Change Residential 693 687 6 Commercial 74 73 1 Industrial Other Total Regulated T&D Electric Customers 767 760 7 Regulated T&D Electric Revenue increased by $50 million primarily due to: An increase of $24 million in Other Regulated T&D Electric Revenue from the resale of energy and capacity purchased under the power purchase agreement between Panda Brandywine, L.P. (Panda) and Pepco (the Panda PPA) (offset in Fuel and Purchased Energy). An increase of $24 million due to a distribution rate change in the District of Columbia that became effective in February 2008. An increase of $16 million due to a distribution rate change under the 2007 Maryland Rate Order that became effective in June 2007, including a positive $13 million Revenue Decoupling Adjustment. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $11 million due to lower weather related sales (a 4% decrease in Heating Degree Days and a 6% decrease in Cooling Degree Days). A decrease of $6 million due to differences in consumption among the various customer rate classes. 107 PEPCO Default Electricity Supply Default Supply Revenue 2008 2007 Change Residential $ 804 $ 774 $ 30 Commercial 498 459 39 Industrial Other 7 8 (1) Total Default Supply Revenue $ 1,309 $ 1,241 $ 68 Default Electricity Supply Sales (GWh) 2008 2007 Change Residential 7,310 7,692 (382) Commercial 4,126 4,384 (258) Industrial Other 9 37 (28) Total Default Electricity Supply Sales 11,445 12,113 (668) Default Electricity Supply Customers (in thousands) 2008 2007 Change Residential 660 659 1 Commercial 53 52 1 Industrial Other Total Default Electricity Supply Customers 713 711 2 Default Supply Revenue, which is substantially offset in Fuel and Purchased Energy, increased by $68 million primarily due to: An increase of $126 million in market based Default Electricity Supply rates. The increase was partially offset by: A decrease of $27 million due to lower weather related sales (a 4% decrease in Heating Degree Days and a 6% decrease in Cooling Degree Days). A decrease of $22 million primarily due to existing commercial customers electing to purchase electricity from competitive suppliers. A decrease of $10 million primarily due to differences in consumption among the various customer rate classes. The following table shows the percentages of Pepcos total distribution sales by jurisdiction that are derived from customers receiving Default Electricity Supply from Pepco. 2008 2007 Sales to District of Columbia customers 33% 35% Sales to Maryland customers 50% 51% 108 PEPCO Operating Expenses Fuel and Purchased Energy Fuel and Purchased Energy, which is primarily associated with Default Electricity Supply revenue, increased by $89 million to $1,335 million in 2008 from $1,246 million in 2007. The increase was primarily due to the following: An increase of $138 million in average energy costs, the result of new Default Electricity Supply contracts. An increase of $24 million for energy and capacity purchased under the Panda PPA. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $39 million primarily due to commercial customers electing to purchase electricity from competitive suppliers. A decrease of $29 million due to lower weather related sales. Fuel and Purchased Energy expense is substantially offset in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue and Default Supply Revenue. Other Operation and Maintenance Other Operation and Maintenance increased by $2 million to $302 million in 2008 from $300 million in 2007. The increase was primarily due to the following: An increase of $7 million in deferred administrative expenses associated with Default Electricity Supply (offset in Default Supply Revenue) as the result of the inclusion of $5 million of customer late payment fees in the calculation of the deferral. See the discussion below regarding the 2008 correction of an error in recording customer late payment fees, including $3 million related to prior periods. An increase of $3 million due to higher bad debt expenses associated with distribution and Default Electricity Supply customers, of which approximately $1 million was deferred. An increase of $3 million in employee related costs primarily due to the recording of additional stock based compensation expense as discussed below, including $3 million related to prior periods. An increase of $1 million in legal expenses. An increase of $1 million in environmental costs related to spill prevention and waste disposal. 109 The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $5 million in corrective and preventative maintenance costs. A decrease of $4 million in regulatory expenses primarily related to the District of Columbia distribution rate case in 2007. A decrease of $3 million due to various construction project write offs in 2007 related to customer requested work. A decrease of $3 million in accounting fees related to tax consulting services. During 2008, Pepco recorded adjustments to correct errors in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses for prior periods dating back to February 2005 during which (i) customer late payment fees were incorrectly recognized and (ii) stock based compensation expense related to certain restricted stock awards granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan was understated. These adjustments resulted in a total increase in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 of $6 million. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and Amortization expenses decreased by $10 million to $141 million in 2008, from $151 million in 2007. The decrease was primarily due to a change in depreciation rates in accordance with the 2007 Maryland Rate Order. Effect of Settlement of Mirant Bankruptcy Claims The Effect of Settlement of Mirant Bankruptcy Claims reflects the recovery in 2007 of $33 million in operating expenses and certain other costs as damages in the Mirant Corporation (Mirant) bankruptcy settlement. Other Income (Expenses) Other Expenses (which are net of Other Income) increased by $15 million to a net expense of $76 million in 2008 from a net expense of $61 million in 2007. This increase was primarily due to: An increase of $12 million in interest expense due to higher outstanding long term debt during 2008. A decrease of $2 million in Contribution in Aid of Construction tax gross up income. Income Tax Expense Pepcos effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were 35.6% and 33.2%, respectively. While the change in the effective rate between 2008 and 2007 was not significant, the effective rate in each year was impacted by certain non recurring items. In 2008, Pepco recorded certain tax benefits that reduced its overall effective tax rate, including net interest income accrued on the tentative settlement with the IRS on the mixed service cost issue 110 PEPCO discussed below, interest income accrued on other effectively settled and uncertain tax positions, interest income received in 2008 on the Maryland state tax refund referred to below, and deferred tax adjustments related to additional analysis of its deferred tax balances completed in 2008. In 2007, Pepco recorded the receipt of the Maryland state tax refund in the third quarter of 2007 as a reduction in income tax expense. This benefit was partially offset by certain income tax charges recorded in the third quarter of 2007 related to additional analysis of Pepcos deferred tax balances. During the second quarter 2008, Pepco reached a tentative settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concerning the treatment of mixed service costs for income tax purposes during the period 2001 to 2004. On the basis of the tentative settlement, Pepco updated its estimated liability related to mixed service costs and, as a result, recorded a net reduction in its liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $16 million and recognized after tax interest income of $3 million in the second quarter of 2008. See Note (13), Commitments and Contingencies Regulatory and Other Matters IRS Mixed Service Cost Issue, to the financial statements of Pepco set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Capital Requirements Capital Expenditures Pepcos total capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2008, totaled $275 million. These expenditures were primarily related to capital costs associated with new customer services, distribution reliability and transmission. The table below shows Pepcos projected capital expenditures for the five year period 2009 through 2013: For the Year 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Total (Millions of Dollars) Pepco Distribution $ 206 $ 207 $ 221 $ 267 $ 302 $ 1,203 Distribution Blueprint for the Future 11 16 3 72 79 181 Transmission 52 112 157 94 49 464 Transmission Mid Atlantic Power Pathway (MAPP) 46 99 182 128 60 515 Other 12 15 25 26 15 93 $ 327 $ 449 $ 588 $ 587 $ 505 $ 2,456 Pepco expects to fund these expenditures through internally generated cash and from external financing and capital contributions from PHI. As further discussed in Note (10), Debt to the Pepco financial statements set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, PHI, Pepco, Delmarva Power & Light Company (DPL) and Atlantic City Electric Company (ACE) maintain credit facilities to provide for their respective short term liquidity needs. The aggregate borrowing limit under the facilities is $1.9 billion. The primary facility consists of a $1.5 billion facility which expires in 2012, all or any portion of which may be used to obtain loans or to issue letters of credit. PHIs credit limit under the facility is $875 million. The credit limit of Pepco is the lesser of $500 million and the maximum amount of debt the company is permitted to have outstanding by its regulatory authorities which is $500 million, 111 PEPCO except that the aggregate amount of credit used by Pepco, DPL and ACE at any given time collectively may not exceed $625 million. Distribution and Transmission The projected capital expenditures listed in the table for distribution (other than Blueprint for the Future) and transmission (other than MAPP) are primarily for facility replacements and upgrades to accommodate customer growth and reliability. Blueprint for the Future During 2007, Pepco announced an initiative it refers to as the Blueprint for the Future. The initiative combines traditional energy efficiency programs with new technologies and systems to help customers manage their energy use and reduce the total cost of energy. Pepco has made filings with the District of Columbia Public Service Commission (DCPSC) and the MPSC for approval of certain aspects of these programs. On December 18, 2008, the DCPSC conditionally approved five DSM programs. The cost of these programs will be recovered through a rate surcharge. On December 31, 2008, the MPSC conditionally approved for both Pepco and DPL, four residential and four non residential DSM/energy efficiency programs. The MPSC will consider an Advanced Metering Infrastructure program in a separate proceeding. Pepco anticipates that the costs of these programs will be recovered through a previously approved surcharge mechanism. MAPP Project In October 2007, the PJM Board of Managers approved PHIs proposed MAPP transmission project for construction of a new 230 mile, 500 kilovolt interstate transmission project at a then estimated cost of $1 billion. This MAPP project will originate at Possum Point substation in northern Virginia, connect into three substations across southern Maryland, cross the Chesapeake Bay, tie into two substations across the Delmarva Peninsula and terminate at Salem substation in southern New Jersey. This MAPP project is part of PJMs Regional Transmission Expansion Plan required to address the reliability objectives of the PJM RTO system. On December 4, 2008, the PJM Board approved a direct current technology for segments of the project including the Chesapeake Bay Crossing. With this modification, the cost of the MAPP project currently is estimated at $1.4 billion. PJM has determined that the line segment from Possum Point substation to the second substation on the Delmarva Peninsula (Indian River substation) is required to be operational by June 1, 2013. PJM is continuing to evaluate the in service date for the remaining 80 miles of line segment to connect the Indian River substation to the Salem substation. Construction is expected to occur in stages over the next five year period. Proceeds from Settlement of Mirant Bankruptcy Claims On September 5, 2008, Pepco transferred the Panda PPA to Sempra Energy Trading LLC (Sempra), along with a payment to Sempra, terminating all further rights, obligations and liabilities of Pepco under the Panda PPA. The use of the damages received from Mirant to offset above market costs of energy and capacity under the Panda PPA and to make the payment to Sempra reduced the balance of proceeds from the Mirant settlement to approximately $102 million as of December 31, 2008. 112 PEPCO In November 2008, Pepco filed with the DCPSC and the MPSC proposals to share with customers the remaining balance of proceeds from the Mirant settlement in accordance with divestiture sharing formulas previously approved by the respective commissions. Under Pepcos proposals, District of Columbia and Maryland customers would receive a total of approximately $25 million and $29 million, respectively. On December 12, 2008, the DCPSC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking concerning the sharing of the Mirant divestiture proceeds, including the bankruptcy settlement proceeds. The public comment period for the proposed rules has expired without any comments being submitted. This matter remains pending before the DCPSC. On February 17, 2009, Pepco, the Maryland Office of Peoples Counsel (the Maryland OPC) and the MPSC staff filed a settlement agreement with the MPSC. The settlement, among other things, provides that of the remaining balance of the Mirant settlement, Pepco shall distribute $39 million to its Maryland customers through a one time billing credit. If the settlement is approved by the MPSC, Pepco currently estimates that it will result in a pre tax gain in the range of $15 million to $20 million, which will be recorded when the MPSC issues its final order approving the settlement. Pending the final disposition of these funds, the remaining $102 million in proceeds from the Mirant settlement is being accounted for as restricted cash and as a regulatory liability.

DPL provides Default Electricity Supply, which is the supply of electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its territories who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive supplier. Default Electricity Supply is also known as Standard Offer Service in Maryland and in Delaware. DPLs electricity distribution service territory covers approximately 5,000 square miles and has a population of approximately 1.3 million. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 67% of delivered electricity sales were to Delaware customers and approximately 33% were to Maryland customers. In northern Delaware, DPL also supplies and distributes natural gas to retail customers and provides transportation only services to retail customers that purchase natural gas from other suppliers. DPLs natural gas distribution service territory covers approximately 275 square miles and has a population of approximately 500,000. Effective January 2, 2008, DPL sold its retail electric distribution assets and its wholesale electric transmission assets in Virginia. Prior to that date, DPL supplied electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territory who did not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier, which is referred to in Virginia as Default Service. In connection with its approval of new electric service distribution base rates for DPL in Maryland, effective in June, 2007 (the 2007 Maryland Rate Order), the Maryland Public Service Commission (MPSC) approved a bill stabilization adjustment mechanism (BSA) for retail customers. For customers to which the BSA applies, DPL recognizes distribution revenue based on an approved distribution charge per customer. From a revenue recognition standpoint, the BSA thus decouples the distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period. This change in the reporting of distribution revenue has the effect of eliminating changes in retail customer usage (whether due to weather conditions, energy prices, energy efficiency programs or other reasons) as a factor having an impact on reported revenue. As a consequence, the only factors that will cause distribution revenue from retail customers in Maryland to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer. DPL is a wholly owned subsidiary of Conectiv, which is wholly owned by Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI or Pepco Holdings). Because PHI is a public utility holding company subject to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005), the relationship between PHI and DPL and certain activities of DPL are subject to the regulatory oversight of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under PUHCA 2005. IMPACT OF THE CURRENT CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKET DISRUPTIONS The recent disruptions in the capital and credit markets have had an impact on DPLs business. While these conditions have required DPL to make certain adjustments in its financial 116 DPL management activities, DPL believes that it currently has sufficient liquidity to fund its operations and meet its financial obligations. These market conditions, should they continue, however, could have a negative effect on DPLs financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Liquidity Requirements DPL depends on access to the capital and credit markets to meet its liquidity and capital requirements. To meet its liquidity requirements, DPL historically has relied on the issuance of commercial paper and short term notes and on bank lines of credit to supplement internally generated cash from operations. DPLs primary credit source is PHIs $1.5 billion syndicated credit facility, under which DPL can borrow funds, obtain letters of credit and support the issuance of commercial paper in an amount up to $500 million (subject to the limitation that the total utilization by DPL and PHIs other utility subsidiaries cannot exceed $625 million). This facility is in effect until May 2012 and consists of commitments from 17 lenders, no one of which is responsible for more than 8.5% of the total commitment. Due to the recent capital and credit market disruptions, the market for commercial paper was severely restricted for most companies. As a result, DPL has not been able to issue commercial paper on a day to day basis either in amounts or with maturities that it typically has required for cash management purposes. After giving effect to outstanding letters of credit and commercial paper, PHIs utility subsidiaries have an aggregate of $843 million in combined cash and borrowing capacity under the credit facility at December 31, 2008. During the months of January and February 2009, the average daily amount of the combined cash and borrowing capacity of PHIs utility subsidiaries was $831 million and ranged from a low of $673 million to a high of $1 billion. To address the challenges posed by the current capital and credit market environment and to ensure that it will continue to have sufficient access to cash to meet its liquidity needs, DPL has identified a number of cash and liquidity conservation measures, including opportunities to defer capital expenditures due to lower than anticipated growth. Several measures to reduce expenditures have been taken. Additional measures could be undertaken if conditions warrant. Due to the financial market conditions, which have caused uncertainty of short term funding, DPL issued $250 million in long term debt securities in November, with the proceeds used to refund short term debt incurred to finance utility construction and operations on a temporary basis and incurred to fund the temporary repurchase of tax exempt auction rate securities. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans DPL participates in several of the pension and postretirement benefit plans sponsored by PHI and its subsidiaries for their employees. While the plans have not experienced any significant impact in terms of liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the disruption of the capital and credit markets, the recent stock market declines have caused a decrease in the market value of benefit plan assets in 2008. DPL expects to contribute approximately $10 million to the pension plan in 2009. 117 DPL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following results of operations discussion compares the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2007. Other than this disclosure, information under this item has been omitted in accordance with General Instruction I(2)(a) to the Form 10 K. All amounts in the tables (except sales and customers) are in millions of dollars. Electric Operating Revenue 2008 2007 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 353 $ 337 $ 16 Default Supply Revenue 846 846 Other Electric Revenue 22 22 Total Electric Operating Revenue $ 1,221 $ 1,205 $ 16 The table above shows the amount of Electric Operating Revenue earned that is subject to price regulation (Regulated Transmission and Distribution (T&D) Electric Revenue and Default Supply Revenue) and that which is not subject to price regulation (Other Electric Revenue). Regulated T&D Electric Revenue includes revenue from the delivery of electricity, including the delivery of Default Electricity Supply, to DPLs customers within its service territory at regulated rates. Regulated T&D Electric Revenue also includes transmission service revenue that DPL receives as a transmission owner from PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM). Default Supply Revenue is the revenue received for Default Electricity Supply. The costs related to Default Electricity Supply are included in Fuel and Purchased Energy. Other Electric Revenue includes work and services performed on behalf of customers, including other utilities, which is not subject to price regulation. Work and services include mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of pole attachments, late payment fees, and collection fees. Regulated T&D Electric Regulated T&D Electric Revenue 2008 2007 Change Residential $ 161 $ 166 $ (5) Commercial 91 91 Industrial 12 12 Other 89 68 21 Total Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 353 $ 337 $ 16 Other Regulated T&D Electric Revenue consists primarily of (i) transmission service revenue, and (ii) either (a) a positive adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from Maryland retail distribution sales falls short of the revenue that DPL is entitled to earn based on the distribution charge per customer approved in the 2007 Maryland Rate Order or (b) a negative 118 DPL adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from such distribution sales exceeds the revenue that DPL is entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer (a Revenue Decoupling Adjustment). Regulated T&D Electric Sales (Gigawatt hours (GWh)) 2008 2007 Change Residential 5,038 5,333 (295) Commercial 5,275 5,471 (196) Industrial 2,652 2,825 (173) Other 50 51 (1) Total Regulated T&D Electric Sales 13,015 13,680 (665) Regulated T&D Electric Customers (in thousands) 2008 2007 Change Residential 438 456 (18) Commercial 58 61 (3) Industrial 1 1 Other 1 1 Total Regulated T&D Electric Customers 498 519 (21) Due to the sale of DPLs Virginia retail electric distribution assets in January 2008, the numbers of Regulated T&D Electric Customers listed above include a decrease of approximately 19,000 residential customers and 3,000 commercial customers. Regulated T&D Electric Revenue increased by $16 million primarily due to: An increase of $15 million primarily due to transmission rate changes in June 2008 and 2007. An increase of $12 million due to a distribution rate change under the 2007 Maryland Rate Order that became effective in June 2007, including a positive $6 million Revenue Decoupling Adjustment. An increase of $7 million due to differences in consumption among the various customer rate classes. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $12 million due to the sale of Virginia retail electric distribution and wholesale transmission assets in January 2008. A decrease of $6 million due to lower weather related sales (a 2% increase in Heating Degree Days and a 23% decrease in Cooling Degree Days). 119 DPL Default Electricity Supply Default Supply Revenue 2008 2007 Change Residential $ 553 $ 556 $ (3) Commercial 249 239 10 Industrial 35 42 (7) Other 9 9 Total Default Supply Revenue $ 846 $ 846 $ Default Electricity Supply Sales (GWh) 2008 2007 Change Residential 4,923 5,257 (334) Commercial 2,263 2,291 (28) Industrial 357 551 (194) Other 43 45 (2) Total Default Electricity Supply Sales 7,586 8,144 (558) Default Electricity Supply Customers (in thousands) 2008 2007 Change Residential 431 447 (16) Commercial 49 51 (2) Industrial Other 1 1 Total Default Electricity Supply Customers 481 499 (18) Due to the sale of DPLs Virginia retail electric distribution assets in January 2008, the numbers of Default Electricity Supply Customers listed above include a decrease of approximately 19,000 residential customers and 3,000 commercial customers. Default Supply Revenue, which is substantially offset in Fuel and Purchased Energy, did not change primarily due to: An increase of $42 million in market based Default Electricity Supply rates. An increase of $8 million primarily due to existing commercial customers electing to purchase a decreased amount of electricity from competitive suppliers. The aggregate amount of these increases was offset by: A decrease of $32 million due to the sale of Virginia retail electric distribution and wholesale transmission assets in January 2008. A decrease of $17 million due to lower weather related sales (a 2% increase in Heating Degree Days and a 23% decrease in Cooling Degree Days). The following table shows the percentages of DPLs total sales by jurisdiction that are derived from customers receiving Default Electricity Supply distribution from DPL. 120 DPL 2008 2007 Sales to Delaware customers 55% 54% Sales to Maryland customers 65% 67% Sales to Virginia customers % 94% Natural Gas Operating Revenue 2008 2007 Change Regulated Gas Revenue $ 204 $ 211 $ (7) Other Gas Revenue 114 80 34 Total Natural Gas Operating Revenue $ 318 $ 291 $ 27 The table above shows the amounts of Natural Gas Operating Revenue from sources that are subject to price regulation (Regulated Gas Revenue) and those that generally are not subject to price regulation (Other Gas Revenue). Regulated Gas Revenue includes the revenue DPL receives from on system natural gas delivered sales and the transportation of natural gas for customers within its service territory. Other Gas Revenue includes off system natural gas sales and the sale of excess system capacity. Regulated Gas Revenue Regulated Gas Revenue 2008 2007 Change Residential $ 121 $ 124 $ (3) Commercial 69 73 (4) Industrial 6 8 (2) Transportation and Other 8 6 2 Total Regulated Gas Revenue $ 204 $ 211 $ (7) Regulated Gas Sales (billion cubic feet) 2008 2007 Change Residential 7 8 (1) Commercial 5 5 Industrial 1 1 Transportation and Other 7 7 Total Regulated Gas Sales 20 21 (1) Regulated Gas Customers (in thousands) 2008 2007 Change Residential 113 112 1 Commercial 9 10 (1) Industrial Transportation and Other Total Regulated Gas Customers 122 122 121 DPL Regulated Gas Revenue decreased by $7 million primarily due to: A decrease of $4 million due to differences in consumption among the various customer rate classes. A decrease of $3 million due to lower weather related sales (a 3% decrease in Heating Degree Days). A decrease of $2 million primarily due to Gas Cost Rate changes effective April 2007, November 2007 and November 2008. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $2 million due to a distribution base rate change effective in April 2007. Other Gas Revenue Other Gas Revenue, which is substantially offset in Gas Purchased expense, increased by $34 million primarily due to revenue from higher off system sales, the result of an increase in market prices. Off system sales are made possible due to available pipeline capacity that results from low demand for natural gas from regulated customers. Operating Expenses Fuel and Purchased Energy Fuel and Purchased Energy, which is primarily associated with Default Electricity Supply revenue, decreased by $18 million to $821 million in 2008 from $839 million in 2007. The decrease was primarily due to: A decrease of $45 million due to the sale of Virginia retail electric distribution and wholesale transmission assets in January 2008. A decrease of $18 million due to lower weather related sales. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $33 million in average energy costs, the result of new Default Electricity Supply contracts. An increase of $11 million due to a higher rate of recovery of electric supply costs resulting in a change in the Default Electric Supply deferral balance. Fuel and Purchased Energy expense is substantially offset in Default Supply Revenue. 122 DPL Gas Purchased Total Gas Purchased, which is primarily offset in Regulated Gas Revenue and Other Gas Revenue, increased by $25 million to $245 million in 2008 from $220 million in 2007. The increase is primarily due to: An increase of $32 million in gas purchases for off system sales, the result of higher average gas costs. The increase was partially offset by: A decrease of $10 million due to a lower rate of recovery of natural gas supply costs resulting in a change in the deferred gas fuel balance. Other Operation and Maintenance Other Operation and Maintenance increased by $16 million to $222 million in 2008 from $206 million in 2007. The increase was primarily due to the following: An increase of $10 million in deferred administrative expenses associated with Default Electricity Supply (offset in Default Supply Revenue) due to (i) the inclusion of $5 million of customer late payment fees in the calculation of the deferral and (ii) a higher rate of recovery of bad debt and administrative expenses as a result of an increase in Default Electricity Supply revenue rates. See the discussion below regarding the 2008 correction of an error in recording customer late payment fees, including $3 million related to prior periods. An increase of $5 million due to higher bad debt expenses associated with distribution and Default Electricity Supply customers, of which approximately $2 million was deferred. An increase of $2 million in employee related costs due to the recording of additional stock based compensation expense as discussed below, including $2 million related to prior periods. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $2 million primarily in emergency restoration costs. During 2008, DPL recorded adjustments to correct errors in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses for prior periods dating back to May 2006 during which (i) customer late payment fees were incorrectly recognized and (ii) stock based compensation expense related to certain restricted stock awards granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan was understated. These adjustments resulted in a total increase in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 of $5 million. 123 DPL Gain on Sale of Assets Gain on Sale of Assets increased by $3 million to $4 million in 2008 from $1 million in 2007. The increase was primarily due to a $4 million gain on the sale of Virginia retail electric distribution and wholesale transmission assets in January 2008. Other Income (Expenses) Other Expenses (which are net of Other Income) decreased by $5 million to a net expense of $35 million in 2008 from a net expense of $40 million in 2007. The decrease was primarily due to a $4 million net decrease in interest expense on short and long term debt. Income Tax Expense DPLs effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were 39.8% and 45.1%, respectively. While the change in the effective rate between 2008 and 2007 was not significant, the effective rate in each year was impacted by certain non recurring items. In 2008, DPL recorded certain tax benefits that reduced its overall effective tax rate, primarily representing net interest income accrued on the tentative settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on the mixed service cost issue discussed below. This benefit was largely offset by income tax charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to additional analysis of DPLs deferred tax balances. In 2007, DPL recorded certain income tax charges in the third quarter of 2007 related to additional analysis of DPLs deferred tax balances. During the second quarter 2008, DPL reached a tentative settlement with the Internal Revenue Service concerning the treatment of mixed service costs for income tax purposes during the period 2001 to 2004. On the basis of the tentative settlement, DPL updated its estimated liability related to mixed service costs and, as a result, recorded a net reduction in its liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $1 million and recognized after tax interest income of $2 million in the second quarter of 2008. See Note (14), Commitments and Contingencies Regulatory and Other Matters IRS Mixed Service Cost Issue, to the financial statements of DPL set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Capital Requirements Capital Expenditures DPLs total capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2008, totaled $150 million. These expenditures were primarily related to capital costs associated with new customer services, distribution reliability and transmission. 124 DPL The table below shows DPLs projected capital expenditures for the five year period 2009 through 2013: For the Year 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Total (Millions of Dollars) DPL Distribution $ 104 $ 98 $ 108 $ 120 $ 119 $ 549 Distribution Blueprint for the Future 31 47 1 40 119 Transmission 65 46 60 72 122 365 Transmission Mid Atlantic Power Pathway (MAPP) 10 94 181 345 220 850 Gas Delivery 20 21 20 21 19 101 Other 18 23 18 14 11 84 $ 248 $ 329 $ 388 $ 612 $ 491 $ 2,068 DPL expects to fund these expenditures through internally generated cash and from external financing and capital contributions from PHI. As further discussed in Note (11), Debt, to the DPL financial statements set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, PHI, Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco), DPL and Atlantic City Electric Company (ACE) maintain credit facilities to provide for their respective short term liquidity needs. The aggregate borrowing limit under the facilities is $1.9 billion. The primary facility consists of a $1.5 billion facility which expires in 2012, all or any portion of which may be used to obtain loans or to issue letters of credit. PHIs credit limit under the facility is $875 million. The credit limit for DPL is the lesser of $500 million and the maximum amount of debt the company is permitted to have outstanding by its regulatory authorities which is $500 million, except that the aggregate amount of credit used by Pepco, DPL and ACE at any given time collectively may not exceed $625 million. Distribution, Transmission and Gas Delivery The projected capital expenditures listed in the table for distribution (other than Blueprint for the Future), transmission (other than MAPP) and gas delivery are primarily for facility replacements and upgrades to accommodate customer growth and reliability. Blueprint for the Future During 2007, DPL announced an initiative that is referred to as the Blueprint for the Future. This initiative combines traditional energy efficiency programs with new technologies and systems to help customers manage their energy use and reduce the total cost of energy, and includes the installation of smart meters for all customers in Delaware and Maryland. DPL has made filings with the Delaware Public Service Commission (DPSC) and the MPSC for approval of certain aspects of these programs. Delaware has approved a recovery mechanism associated with these plans, and work has proceeded to prepare to begin installation of an Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) by the last quarter of 2009. On December 31, 2008, the MPSC conditionally approved four residential and four non residential DSM/energy efficiency programs. The MPSC will consider an AMI program in a separate proceeding. DPL anticipates that the costs of these programs will be recovered through a previously approved surcharge mechanism. 125 DPL MAPP Project In October 2007, the PJM Board of Managers approved PHIs proposed MAPP transmission project for construction of a new 230 mile, 500 kilovolt interstate transmission project at a then estimated cost of $1 billion. This MAPP project will originate at Possum Point substation in northern Virginia, connect into three substations across southern Maryland, cross the Chesapeake Bay, tie into two substations across the Delmarva Peninsula and terminate at Salem substation in southern New Jersey. This MAPP project is part of PJMs Regional Transmission Expansion Plan required to address the reliability objectives of the PJM RTO system. On December 4, 2008, the PJM Board approved a direct current technology for segments of the project including the Chesapeake Bay Crossing. With this modification, the cost of the MAPP project is currently estimated at $1.4 billion. PJM has determined that the line segment from Possum Point substation to the second substation on the Delmarva Peninsula (Indian River substation) is required to be operational by June 1, 2013. PJM is continuing to evaluate the in service date for the remaining 80 miles of line segment to connect the Indian River substation to the Salem substation. Construction is expected to occur in sections over the next five year period.

ACE provides Default Electricity Supply, which is the supply of electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territory who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive supplier. Default Electricity Supply is also known as Basic Generation Service (BGS) in New Jersey. ACEs service territory covers approximately 2,700 square miles and has a population of approximately 1.1 million. ACE is a wholly owned subsidiary of Conectiv, which is wholly owned by Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI or Pepco Holdings). Because PHI is a public utility holding company subject to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005), the relationship between PHI and ACE and certain activities of ACE are subject to the regulatory oversight of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under PUHCA 2005. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In February 2007, ACE completed the sale of the B.L. England generating facility. B.L. England comprised a significant component of ACEs generation operations and its sale required discontinued operations presentation under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, on ACEs Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. In September 2006, ACE sold its interests in the Keystone and Conemaugh generating facilities, which for the year ended December 31, 2006, is also reflected as discontinued operations. The following table summarizes information related to the discontinued operations for the years presented (millions of dollars): 2008 2007 2006 Operating Revenue $ $ 10 $ 114 Income Before Income Tax Expense $ $ $ 4 Net Income $ $ $ 2 IMPACT OF THE CURRENT CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKET DISRUPTIONS The recent disruptions in the capital and credit markets have had an impact on ACEs business. While these conditions have required ACE to make certain adjustments in its financial management activities, ACE believes that it currently has sufficient liquidity to fund its operations and meet its financial obligations. These market conditions, should they continue, however, could have a negative effect on ACEs financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 129 ACE Liquidity Requirements ACE depends on access to the capital and credit markets to meet its liquidity and capital requirements. To meet its liquidity requirements, ACE historically has relied on the issuance of commercial paper and short term notes and on bank lines of credit to supplement internally generated cash from operations. ACEs primary credit source is PHIs $1.5 billion syndicated credit facility, under which ACE can borrow funds, obtain letters of credit and support the issuance of commercial paper in an amount up to $500 million (subject to the limitation that the total utilization by ACE and PHIs other utility subsidiaries cannot exceed $625 million). This facility is in effect until May 2012 and consists of commitments from 17 lenders, no one of which is responsible for more than 8.5% of the total commitment. Due to the recent capital and credit market disruptions, the market for commercial paper was severely restricted for most companies. As a result, ACE has not been able to issue commercial paper on a day to day basis either in amounts or with maturities that it typically has required for cash management purposes. After giving effect to outstanding letters of credit and commercial paper, PHIs utility subsidiaries have an aggregate of $843 million in combined cash and borrowing capacity under the credit facility at December 31, 2008. During the months of January and February 2009, the average daily amount of the combined cash and borrowing capacity of PHIs utility subsidiaries was $831 million and ranged from a low of $673 million to a high of $1 billion. To address the challenges posed by the current capital and credit market environment and to ensure that it will continue to have sufficient access to cash to meet its liquidity needs, ACE has identified a number of cash and liquidity conservation measures, including opportunities to defer capital expenditures due to lower than anticipated growth. Several measures to reduce expenditures have been taken. Additional measures could be undertaken if conditions warrant. Due to the financial market conditions, which have caused uncertainty of short term funding, ACE issued $250 million in long term debt securities in November. The proceeds were used to refund short term debt incurred to finance utility construction and operations on a temporary basis and incurred to fund the temporary repurchase of tax exempt auction rate securities. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans ACE participates in pension and postretirement benefit plans sponsored by PHI for employees. While the plans have not experienced any significant impact in terms of liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the disruption of the capital and credit markets, the recent stock market declines have caused a decrease in the market value of benefit plan assets in 2008. ACE expects to contribute approximately $60 million to the pension plan in 2009. 130 ACE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following results of operations discussion compares the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2007. Other than this disclosure, information under this item has been omitted in accordance with General Instruction I(2)(a) to the Form 10 K. All amounts in the tables (except sales and customers) are in millions of dollars. Operating Revenue 2008 2007 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 359 $ 327 $ 32 Default Supply Revenue 1,258 1,199 59 Other Electric Revenue 16 17 (1) Total Operating Revenue $ 1,633 $ 1,543 $ 90 The table above shows the amount of Operating Revenue earned that is subject to price regulation (Regulated Transmission and Distribution (T&D) Electric Revenue and Default Supply Revenue) and that which is not subject to price regulation (Other Electric Revenue). Regulated T&D Electric Revenue includes revenue from the delivery of electricity, including the delivery of Default Electricity Supply, to ACEs customers within its service territory at regulated rates. Regulated T&D Electric Revenue also includes transmission service revenue that ACE receives as a transmission owner from PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM). Default Supply Revenue is the revenue received for Default Electricity Supply. The costs related to Default Electricity Supply are included in Fuel and Purchased Energy. Default Supply Revenue also includes revenue from transition bond charges and other restructuring related revenues. Other Electric Revenue includes work and services performed on behalf of customers, including other utilities, which is not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of pole attachments, late payment fees, and collection fees. In response to an order issued by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities regarding changes to ACEs retail transmission rates, ACE has established deferred accounting treatment for the difference between the rates that ACE is authorized to charge its customers for the transmission of Default Electricity Supply and the cost that ACE incurs based on transmission formula rates approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Under the deferral arrangement, any over or under recovery is deferred as part of Deferred Electric Service Costs pending an adjustment of retail rates in a future proceeding. As a consequence of the order, effective January 1, 2008, ACEs retail transmission revenue is being recorded as Default Supply Revenue, rather than as Regulated T&D Electric Revenue, thereby conforming to the practice of PHIs other utility subsidiaries, which previously established deferred accounting treatment for any over or under recovery of retail transmission rates relative to the cost incurred based on FERC approved transmission formula rates. ACEs retail transmission revenue for the period prior to January 1, 2008 has been reclassified to Default Supply Revenue in order to conform to the current period presentation. 131 ACE Regulated T&D Electric Regulated T&D Electric Revenue 2008 2007 Change Residential $ 160 $ 150 $ 10 Commercial 111 100 11 Industrial 17 14 3 Other 71 63 8 Total Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 359 $ 327 $ 32 Other Regulated T&D Electric Revenue consists primarily of transmission service revenue. Regulated T&D Electric Sales (Gigawatt hours (GWh)) 2008 2007 Change Residential 4,418 4,520 (102) Commercial 4,492 4,469 23 Industrial 1,129 1,149 (20) Other 50 49 1 Total Regulated T&D Electric Sales 10,089 10,187 (98) Regulated T&D Electric Customers (in thousands) 2008 2007 Change Residential 481 479 2 Commercial 64 63 1 Industrial 1 1 Other 1 1 Total Regulated T&D Electric Customers 547 544 3 Regulated T&D Electric Revenue increased by $32 million primarily due to: An increase of $24 million due to a distribution rate change as part of a higher New Jersey Societal Benefit Charge that became effective in June 2008 (substantially offset in Deferred Electric Service Costs). An increase of $8 million primarily due to transmission rate changes in June 2008 and 2007. 132 ACE Default Electricity Supply Default Supply Revenue 2008 2007 Change Residential $ 525 $ 513 $ 12 Commercial 378 375 3 Industrial 40 52 (12) Other 315 259 56 Total Default Supply Revenue $ 1,258 $ 1,199 $ 59 Other Default Supply Revenue consists primarily of revenue from the resale in the PJM RTO market of energy and capacity purchased under contracts with non utility generators (NUGs). Default Electricity Supply Sales (GWh) 2008 2007 Change Residential 4,388 4,520 (132) Commercial 3,175 3,235 (60) Industrial 283 363 (80) Other 49 49 Total Default Electricity Supply Sales 7,895 8,167 (272) Default Electricity Supply Customers (in thousands) 2008 2007 Change Residential 481 479 2 Commercial 64 63 1 Industrial 1 1 Other 1 1 Total Default Electricity Supply Customers 547 544 3 Default Supply Revenue, which is substantially offset in Fuel and Purchased Energy and Deferred Electric Service Costs, increased by $59 million primarily due to: An increase of $57 million in wholesale energy revenues due to the sale at higher market prices of electricity purchased from NUGs. An increase of $34 million in market based Default Electricity Supply rates. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $19 million primarily due to existing commercial and industrial customers electing to purchase electricity from competitive suppliers. A decrease of $10 million due to lower weather related sales (a 2% decrease in Heating Degree Days and a 3% decrease in Cooling Degree Days). 133 ACE For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the percentage of ACEs total distribution sales that are derived from customers receiving Default Electricity Supply are 78% and 80%, respectively. Operating Expenses Fuel and Purchased Energy Fuel and Purchased Energy, which is primarily associated with Default Electricity Supply sales, increased by $127 million to $1,178 million in 2008 from $1,051 million in 2007. The increase was primarily due to: An increase of $162 million in average energy costs, the result of new Default Electricity Supply contracts. The increase was partially offset by: A decrease of $21 million primarily due to commercial and industrial customers electing to purchase electricity from competitive suppliers. A decrease of $14 million due to lower weather related sales. Fuel and Purchased Energy is substantially offset in Default Supply Revenue and Deferred Electric Service Costs. Other Operation and Maintenance Other Operation and Maintenance increased by $18 million to $183 million in 2008 from $165 million in 2007. The increase was primarily due to the following: An increase of $4 million in preventative maintenance and system operation costs. An increase of $3 million due to higher bad debt expenses associated with distribution customers (offset in Deferred Electric Service Costs). An increase of $3 million in Demand Side Management program costs (offset in Deferred Electric Service Costs). An increase of $2 million in employee related costs, primarily due to the recording of additional stock based compensation expense as discussed below, including $1 million related to prior periods. An increase of $2 million in costs associated with Default Electricity Supply. An increase of $1 million in legal expenses. During 2008, ACE recorded an adjustment to correct errors in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses for certain restricted stock awards granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan. This adjustment resulted in an increase in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 of $1 million. 134 ACE Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and Amortization expenses increased by $24 million to $104 million in 2008 from $80 million in 2007. This increase was primarily due to higher amortization of stranded costs as a result of an October 2007 Transition Bond Charge rate increase (offset in Default Supply Revenue). Deferred Electric Service Costs Deferred Electric Service Costs decreased by $75 million to income of $9 million in 2008 from an expense of $66 million in 2007. The decrease was primarily due to: A decrease of $46 million due to a lower rate of recovery associated with deferred energy costs. A decrease of $29 million due to a lower rate of recovery of costs associated with energy and capacity purchased under the NUGs. A decrease of $17 million due to a lower rate of recovery associated with deferred transmission costs. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $15 million primarily due to a higher rate of recovery associated with Demand Side Management program costs. Deferred Electric Service Costs are substantially offset in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue and Other Operation and Maintenance. Income Tax Expense ACEs effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were 31.9% and 40.6%, respectively. The significant year over year decline in the effective tax rate reflects certain non recurring items recorded in 2008. In 2008, ACE recorded certain tax benefits that reduced its overall effective tax rate, primarily representing net interest income accrued on uncertain tax positions (including interest related to the tentative settlement with the IRS on the mixed service cost issue discussed below and a claim made with the IRS related to the tax reporting of fuel over and under recoveries). This benefit was partially offset by income tax charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to additional analysis of ACEs deferred tax balances completed in 2008. In 2007, ACE recorded certain income tax credits in the third quarter of 2007 related to additional analysis of ACEs deferred tax balances. During the second quarter 2008, ACE reached a tentative settlement with the Internal Revenue Service concerning the treatment of mixed service costs for income tax purposes during the period 2001 to 2004. On the basis of the tentative settlement, ACE updated its estimated liability related to mixed service costs and, as a result, recorded a net reduction in its liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $2 million and recognized after tax interest income of $2 million in the second quarter of 2008. See Note (14), Commitments and Contingencies Regulatory and Other Matters IRS Mixed Service Cost Issue, to the consolidated financial statements of ACE set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 135 ACE Capital Requirements Capital Expenditures ACEs total capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2008, totaled $162 million. These expenditures were primarily related to capital costs associated with new customer services, distribution reliability and transmission. The table below shows ACEs projected capital expenditures for the five year period 2009 through 2013: For the Year 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Total (Millions of Dollars) ACE Distribution $ 97 $ 96 $ 104 $ 109 $ 111 $ 517 Distribution Blueprint for the Future 5 8 1 8 22 Transmission 26 25 32 34 33 150 Transmission Mid Atlantic Power Pathway (MAPP) 1 20 21 Other 11 14 18 17 12 72 $ 139 $ 143 $ 155 $ 161 $ 184 $ 782 ACE expects to fund these expenditures through internally generated cash and from external financing and capital contributions from PHI. As further discussed in Note (10), Debt, to the ACE consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, PHI, Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco), Delmarva Power & Light Company (DPL) and ACE maintain credit facilities to provide for their respective short term liquidity needs. The aggregate borrowing limit under the facilities is $1.9 billion. The primary facility consists of a $1.5 billion facility which expires in 2012, all or any portion of which may be used to obtain loans or to issue letters of credit. PHIs credit limit under the facility is $875 million. The credit limit for ACE is the lesser of $500 million and the maximum amount of debt the company is permitted to have outstanding by its regulatory authorities which is $250 million, except that the aggregate amount of credit used by Pepco, DPL and ACE at any given time collectively may not exceed $625 million. Distribution and Transmission The projected capital expenditures listed in the table for distribution (other than Blueprint for the Future) and transmission (other than MAPP) are primarily for facility replacements and upgrades to accommodate customer growth and reliability. Blueprint for the Future During 2007, ACE announced an initiative that is referred to as the Blueprint for the Future. This initiative combines traditional energy efficiency programs with new technologies and systems to help customers manage their energy use and reduce the total cost of energy, and includes the installation of smart meters for all customers in New Jersey. In November 2007, ACE filed its Blueprint for the Future proposal with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. 136 ACE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Some of the statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are subject to the safe harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include declarations regarding ACEs intents, beliefs and current expectations. In some cases, you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may, will, should, expects, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential or continue or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology. Any forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results could differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements. Forward looking statements involve estimates, assumptions, known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause ACEs actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. The forward looking statements contained herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to the following important factors, which are difficult to predict, contain uncertainties, are beyond ACEs control and may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements: Prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions affecting the energy industry, including allowed rates of return, industry and rate structure, acquisition and disposal of assets and facilities, operation and construction of plant facilities, recovery of purchased power expenses, and present or prospective wholesale and retail competition; Changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and policies; Weather conditions; Population growth rates and demographic patterns; Competition for retail and wholesale customers; General economic conditions, including potential negative impacts resulting from an economic downturn; Growth in demand, sales and capacity to fulfill demand; Changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation; Changes in accounting standards or practices; Changes in project costs; Unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures; The ability to obtain funding in the capital markets on favorable terms; 137 ACE Rules and regulations imposed by federal and or state regulatory commissions, PJM, the North American Electric Reliability Council and other applicable electric reliability organizations; Legal and administrative proceedings (whether civil or criminal) and settlements that influence ACEs business and profitability; Volatility in market demand and prices for energy, capacity and fuel; Interest rate fluctuations and credit and capital market conditions; and Effects of geopolitical events, including the threat of domestic terrorism.

New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for ACE to predict all of such factors, nor can ACE assess the impact of any such factor on ACEs business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement. The foregoing review of factors should not be construed as exhaustive. 138 THIS PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK. 139 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Risk management policies for PHI and its subsidiaries are determined by PHIs Corporate Risk Management Committee, the members of which are PHIs Chief Risk Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Chief Information Officer and other senior executives. The Corporate Risk Management Committee monitors interest rate fluctuation, commodity price fluctuation, and credit risk exposure, and sets risk management policies that establish limits on unhedged risk and determine risk reporting requirements. For information about PHIs derivative activities, other than the information disclosed herein, refer to Note (2), Significant Accounting Policies Accounting For Derivatives and Note (17), Use of Derivatives in Energy and Interest Rate Hedging Activities to the consolidated financial statements of PHI set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Pepco Holdings, Inc. Commodity Price Risk The Competitive Energy segments actively engage in commodity risk management activities to reduce their financial exposure to changes in the value of their assets and obligations due to commodity price fluctuations. Certain of these risk management activities are conducted using instruments classified as derivatives under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133. The Competitive Energy segments also manage commodity risk with contracts that are not classified as derivatives. The Competitive Energy segments primary risk management objectives are (1) to manage the spread between the cost of fuel used to operate their electric generation plants and the revenue received from the sale of the power produced by those plants by selling forward a portion of their projected plant output and buying forward a portion of their projected fuel supply requirements and (2) to manage the spread between wholesale and retail sales commitments and the cost of supply used to service those commitments in order to ensure stable and known cash flows and fix favorable prices and margins when they become available. PHIs risk management policies place oversight at the senior management level through the Corporate Risk Management Committee which has the responsibility for establishing corporate compliance requirements for the Competitive Energy businesses energy market participation. PHI collectively refers to these energy market activities, including its commodity risk management activities, as energy commodity activities. PHI uses a value at risk (VaR) model to assess the market risk of its Competitive Energy segments energy commodity activities. PHI also uses other measures to limit and monitor risk in its energy commodity activities, including limits on the nominal size of positions and periodic loss limits. VaR represents the potential fair value loss on energy contracts or portfolios due to changes in market prices for a specified time period and confidence level. PHI estimates VaR using a delta normal variance / covariance model with a 95 percent, one tailed confidence level and assuming a one day holding period. Since VaR is an estimate, it is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur. 140 Value at Risk Associated with Energy Contracts For the Year Ended December 31, 2008 (Millions of dollars) VaR for Competitive Energy Commodity Activity (a) 95% confidence level, one day holding period, one tailed Period end $ 7 Average for the period $ 6 High $ 12 Low $ 3 (a) This column represents all energy derivative contracts, normal purchase and sales contracts, modeled generation output and fuel requirements and modeled customer load obligations for PHIs energy commodity activities. Conectiv Energy economically hedges both the estimated plant output and fuel requirements as the estimated levels of output and fuel needs change. Economic hedge percentages include the estimated electricity output of Conectiv Energys generation plants and any associated financial or physical commodity contracts (including derivative contracts that are classified as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133, other derivative instruments, wholesale normal purchase and sales contracts, and default electricity supply contracts). Conectiv Energy maintains a forward 36 month program with targeted ranges for economically hedging its projected plant output combined with its energy purchase commitments. Beginning in 2008, Conectiv Energy changed its disclosure to show the percentage of its entire expected plant output and energy purchase commitments for all hours that are hedged, as opposed to its hedged position with respect to its projected on peak plant output and on peak energy commitments, which previously was disclosed. This change was made in recognition of the significant quantity of projected off peak plant output and purchase commitments and due to the increased volatility of power prices during off peak hours. Also beginning in 2008, Conectiv Energy is including default electricity supply contracts and associated hedges in Independent System Operator New England. The hedge percentages for all expected plant output and purchase commitment (based on the current forward electricity price curve) are as follows: Month Target Range 1 12 50 100% 13 24 25 75% 25 36 0 50% The primary purpose of the risk management program is to improve the predictability and stability of margins by selling forward a portion of projected plant output, and buying forward a 141 portion of projected fuel supply requirements. Within each period, hedged percentages can vary significantly above or below the average reported percentages. As of December 31, 2008, the electricity sold forward by Conectiv Energy as a percentage of projected plant output combined with energy purchase commitments was 81%, 75%, and 39% for the 1 12 month, 13 24 month and 25 36 month forward periods, respectively. The amount of forward sales during the 1 12 month period represents 21% of Conectiv Energys combined total generating capability and energy purchase commitments. The volumetric percentages for the forward periods can vary and may not represent the amount of expected value hedged. Not all of the value associated with Conectiv Energys generation activities can be hedged such as the portion attributable to ancillary services and fuel switching due to the lack of market products, market liquidity, and other factors. Also the hedging of locational value can be limited. Pepco Energy Services purchases electric and natural gas futures, swaps, options and forward contracts to hedge price risk in connection with the purchase of physical natural gas and electricity for delivery to customers. Pepco Energy Services accounts for its futures and swap contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions. Its options contracts and certain commodity contracts that do not qualify as cash flow hedges are marked to market through current earnings. Its forward contracts are accounted for using standard accrual accounting since these contracts meet the requirements for normal purchase and sale accounting under SFAS No. 133. Credit and Nonperformance Risk Pepco Holdings subsidiaries attempt to minimize credit risk exposure to wholesale energy counterparties through, among other things, formal credit policies, regular assessment of counterparty creditworthiness and the establishment of a credit limit for each counterparty, monitoring procedures that include stress testing, the use of standard agreements which allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty and collateral requirements under certain circumstances, and have established reserves for credit losses. As of December 31, 2008, credit exposure to wholesale energy counterparties was weighted 78% with investment grade counterparties, 16% with counterparties without external credit quality ratings, and 5% with non investment grade counterparties. This table provides information on the Competitive Energy businesses credit exposure, net of collateral, to wholesale counterparties. 142 Schedule of Credit Risk Exposure on Competitive Wholesale Energy Contracts December 31, 2008 (Millions of dollars) Rating (a) Exposure Before Credit Collateral (b) Credit Collateral (c) Net Exposure Number of Counterparties Greater Than 10% (d) Net Exposure of Counterparties Greater Than 10% Investment Grade $282 $1 $281 2 $157 Non Investment Grade 19 19 No External Ratings 62 7 55 Credit reserves $ 2 (a) Investment Grade primarily determined using publicly available credit ratings of the counterparty. If the counterparty has provided a guarantee by a higher rated entity (e.g., its parent), it is determined based upon the rating of its guarantor. Included in Investment Grade are counterparties with a minimum Standard & Poors or Moodys Investor Service rating of BBB or Baa3, respectively. (b) Exposure Before Credit Collateral includes the marked to market (MTM) energy contract net assets for open/unrealized transactions, the net receivable/payable for realized transactions and net open positions for contracts not subject to MTM. Amounts due from counterparties are offset by liabilities payable to those counterparties to the extent that legally enforceable netting arrangements are in place.
