Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The information required by this item is contained herein, as follows: Registrants Page No. Pepco Holdings 40 Pepco 95 DPL 104 ACE 114 39 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Pepco Holdings, Inc. General Overview Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI or Pepco Holdings) is a diversified energy company that, through its operating subsidiaries, is engaged primarily in two businesses: the distribution, transmission and default supply of electricity and the delivery and supply of natural gas (Power Delivery) competitive energy generation, marketing and supply (Competitive Energy). The following table sets forth the percentage contributions to consolidated operating revenue and operating income attributable to the Power Delivery and Competitive Energy businesses. December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (% including Intercompany Transactions) Percentage of Consolidated Operating Revenue Power Delivery 54 % 51 % 56 % Competitive Energy 49 % 53 % 48 % Percentage of Consolidated Operating Income Power Delivery 73 % 72 % 66 % Competitive Energy 20 % 36 % 26 % Percentage of Power Delivery Operating Revenue Power Delivery Electric 95 % 94 % 94 % Power Delivery Gas 5 % 6 % 6 % Power Delivery Electric consists primarily of the transmission, distribution and default supply of electricity, and Power Delivery Gas consists of the distribution and supply of natural gas. Power Delivery represents one operating segment for financial reporting purposes. The Power Delivery business is conducted by PHIs three utility subsidiaries: Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco), Delmarva Power & Light Company (DPL) and Atlantic City Electric Company (ACE). Each of these companies is a regulated public utility in the jurisdictions that comprise its service territory. Each company is responsible for the delivery of electricity and, in the case of DPL, natural gas in its service territory, for which it is paid tariff rates established by the applicable local public service commission. Each company also supplies electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territory who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier. The regulatory term for this supply service is Standard Office Service in Delaware, the District of Columbia and Maryland and Basic Generation Service in New Jersey. In this Form 10 K, these supply services are referred to generally as Default Electricity Supply. Pepco, DPL and ACE are also responsible for the transmission of wholesale electricity into and across their service territories. The rates each company is permitted to charge for the wholesale transmission of electricity are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Transmission rates are updated annually based on a FERC approved formula methodology. The profitability of the Power Delivery business depends on its ability to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on its capital investments through the rates it is permitted to charge. The Power Delivery operating results historically have been seasonal, generally producing higher revenue and income in the warmest and coldest periods of the year. Operating results also can be affected by economic conditions, energy prices and the impact of energy efficiency measures on customer usage of electricity. 40 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Effective June 2007, the Maryland Public Service Commission (MPSC) approved a bill stabilization adjustment mechanism (BSA) for retail customers of Pepco and DPL. The District of Columbia Public Service Commission (DCPSC) also approved a BSA for Pepcos retail customers, effective in November 2009. For customers to whom the BSA applies, Pepco and DPL recognize distribution revenue based on the approved distribution charge per customer. From a revenue recognition standpoint, this has the effect of decoupling distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period. As a consequence, the only factors that will cause distribution revenue in Maryland and the District of Columbia to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer. For customers to whom the BSA applies, changes in customer usage (such as due to weather conditions, energy prices, energy efficiency programs or other reasons) from period to period have no impact on reported distribution revenue. As a result of the BSA in Maryland and the District of Columbia, a Revenue Decoupling Adjustment is recorded representing either (a) a positive adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from Maryland and District and Columbia retail distribution sales falls short of the revenue that Pepco and DPL are entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer or (b) a negative adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from such distribution sales exceeds the revenue that Pepco and DPL are entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer. The Competitive Energy business provides competitive generation, marketing and supply of electricity and gas, and energy management services primarily in the mid Atlantic region. These operations are conducted through: Subsidiaries of Conectiv Energy Holding Company (collectively, Conectiv Energy), which engage primarily in the generation and wholesale supply and marketing of electricity and gas within the PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM) and Independent System Operator New England (ISONE) wholesale markets. Pepco Energy Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, Pepco Energy Services), which provide retail energy supply and energy services primarily to commercial, industrial, and governmental customers. Each of Conectiv Energy and Pepco Energy Services is a separate operating segment for financial reporting purposes. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, amounts equal to 6%, 7% and 10%, respectively, of the operating revenues of the Competitive Energy business were attributable to electric energy and capacity, and natural gas sold to the Power Delivery segment. Conectiv Energys primary business objective is to maximize the value of its generation fleet by leveraging its operational and fuel flexibilities. Pepco Energy Services primary objective is to provide energy savings performance contracting services to federal, state and local government and commercial customers throughout the United States. The financial results of the Competitive Energy business can be significantly affected by wholesale and retail energy prices, the cost of fuel and gas to operate the Conectiv Energy generating facilities, the cost of purchased energy necessary to meet its power and gas supply obligations, and the cost of construction services provided by Pepco Energy Services. The Competitive Energy business, like the Power Delivery business, is seasonal, and therefore weather can have a material impact on operating results. On December 7, 2009, PHI announced that it will wind down the retail electric and natural gas supply business that it conducts through Pepco Energy Services. The decision was made after considering, among other factors, the return PHI earns by investing capital in the retail energy supply business as compared to alternative investments. To effectuate the wind down, Pepco Energy Services will continue to fulfill all of its commercial and regulatory obligations and perform its customer service functions to ensure that it meets 41 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS the needs of its customers, but will not be entering into any new retail energy supply contracts. Operating revenues related to the retail energy supply business for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $2.3 billion, $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, and operating income amounts for the same periods were $88 million, $54 million and $39 million, respectively. PHI expects the retail energy supply business to remain profitable through December 31, 2012, based on its existing contract backlog and its corresponding portfolio of wholesale hedges, with minimal losses beyond that date. Substantially all of Pepco Energy Services retail customer obligations will be fully performed by June 1, 2014. In connection with the operation of the retail energy supply business, as of December 31, 2009, Pepco Energy Services had collateral requirements, which are based on existing wholesale energy purchase and sale contracts and current market prices, of approximately $280 million committed to its wholesale energy suppliers. Of this collateral amount, $157 million was in the form of letters of credit and $123 million was posted in cash. Pepco Energy Services estimates that at current market prices, with the wind down of the retail energy supply business, this collateral will be released as follows: 53% by December 31, 2010, an aggregate of 81% by December 31, 2011, an aggregate of 94% by December 31, 2012, and substantially all collateral by June, 1, 2014. As a result of the decision to wind down the retail energy supply business, Pepco Energy Services in the fourth quarter of 2009 recorded (i) a $4 million pre tax impairment charge reflecting the write off of all goodwill allocated to the business and (ii) a pre tax charge of less than $1 million related to employee severance. Pepco Energy Services remaining businesses will not be significantly affected by the wind down of the retail energy supply business. Through its subsidiary Potomac Capital Investment Corporation (PCI), PHI maintains a portfolio of cross border energy lease investments with a book value at December 31, 2009 of approximately $1.4 billion. This activity constitutes a fourth operating segment, which is designated as Other Non Regulated, for financial reporting purposes. For a discussion of PHIs cross border energy lease investments, see Note (17), Commitments and Contingencies Regulatory and Other Matters PHIs Cross Border Energy Lease Investments, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI, set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Business Strategy PHIs business strategy is to remain a mid Atlantic regional diversified energy delivery utility and competitive energy services company focused on value creation, operational excellence and environmental responsibility. The components of this strategy include: Achieving earnings growth in the Power Delivery business by focusing on transmission and distribution infrastructure investments and constructive regulatory outcomes, while maintaining a high level of operational excellence. Pursuing technologies and practices that promote energy efficiency, energy conservation and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Supplementing PHIs utility earnings through competitive energy businesses engaged in generation of electricity and the wholesale supply of electricity and natural gas primarily within the PJM RTO, and 42 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS providing energy performance services and renewable energy and combined heat and power alternatives to commercial, industrial and government customers. To further this business strategy, PHI may from time to time examine a variety of transactions involving its existing businesses, including the entry into joint ventures or the disposition of one or more businesses, as well as possible acquisitions. PHI also may reassess or refine the components of its business strategy as it deems necessary or appropriate in response to a wide variety of factors, including the requirements of its businesses, competitive conditions and regulatory requirements. Earnings Overview Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2008 PHIs net income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $235 million, or $1.06 per share, compared to $300 million, or $1.47 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2008. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2009, included the credits set forth below in the Power Delivery segment, which are presented net of federal and state income taxes and are in millions of dollars: Mirant Corporation (Mirant) bankruptcy claims settlement $ 24 Maryland income tax benefit, net of fees $ 11 Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008, included the charges set forth below in the Other Non Regulated operating segment, which are presented net of federal and state income taxes and are in millions of dollars: Adjustment to the equity value of cross border energy lease investments to reflect the impact of a change in assumptions regarding the estimated timing of the tax benefits $ (86 ) Additional interest accrued related to the estimated federal and state income tax obligations from the change in assumptions regarding the estimated timing of the tax benefits on cross border energy lease investments $ (7 ) Excluding the items listed above, net income would have been $200 million, or $0.91 per share, in 2009 and $393 million, or $1.93 per share, in 2008. PHIs net income for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, by operating segment, is set forth in the table below (in millions of dollars): 2009 2008 Change Power Delivery $ 199 $ 250 $ (51 ) Conectiv Energy 15 122 (107 ) Pepco Energy Services 40 39 1 Other Non Regulated 30 (59 ) 89 Corporate and Other (49 ) (52 ) 3 Total PHI Net Income $ 235 $ 300 $ (65 ) 43 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Discussion of Operating Segment Net Income Variances: Power Deliverys $51 million decrease in earnings is primarily due to the following: $30 million decrease due to higher operating and maintenance expenses (primarily higher pension expenses). $17 million decrease due to higher interest expense associated with an increase in outstanding debt. $10 million decrease due to favorable income tax adjustments in 2008, primarily interest resulting from Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidance on income taxes (Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740). $7 million decrease due to higher depreciation expense as the result of increased plant. $5 million decrease attributable to a decrease in unbilled revenue associated with ACE Basic Generation Service (primarily lower usage and migration to competitive suppliers). $4 million decrease due to lower Default Electricity Supply margins, primarily due to increased bad debt expense and commercial customer migration to competitive suppliers. $24 million increase due to the release of restricted cash as the result of Pepcos settlement of its Mirant bankruptcy claim following rulings by the DCPSC and MPSC on customer sharing of the settlement proceeds. $11 million increase due to a Maryland income tax benefit, net of $1 million (after tax) in professional fees, related to a change in the tax reporting for the disposition of certain assets in prior years. Conectiv Energys $107 million decrease in earnings is primarily due to the following: Merchant Generation and Load Service earnings decreased approximately $101 million primarily due to: $79 million decrease resulting from significantly reduced spark (natural gas) spreads and dark (coal) spreads (lower by 57%), and lower run time (lower by 27% excluding tolled generation). $63 million decrease primarily related to economic fuel hedges that were favorable in 2008 due to rising fuel prices and unfavorable in 2009 due to falling fuel prices. $39 million increase due to an increase in capacity margins, primarily due to higher Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) clearing prices in the eastern part of the PJM RTO region. Energy Marketing earnings decreased approximately $6 million primarily due to lower natural gas marketing results primarily due to lower prices and demand. Pepco Energy Services $1 million increase in earnings is primarily due to the following: $25 million increase due to the lower cost of energy and energy supply costs. 44 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS $17 million decrease due to higher interest and other expenses primarily associated with credit and collateral facilities for the retail energy supply business. $4 million decrease due to lower construction activities. $3 million decrease due to impairment of goodwill for the retail energy supply business. Other Non Regulateds $89 million increase in earnings is primarily due to the impact of the cross border energy lease investment re evaluation adjustment recorded in June 2008. Consolidated Results Of Operations The following results of operations discussion is for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. All amounts in the tables (except sales and customers) are in millions of dollars. Operating Revenue A detail of the components of PHIs consolidated operating revenue is as follows: 2009 2008 Change Power Delivery $ 4,980 $ 5,487 $ (507 ) Conectiv Energy 2,171 3,047 (876 ) Pepco Energy Services 2,383 2,648 (265 ) Other Non Regulated 51 (60 ) 111 Corporate and Other (326 ) (422 ) 96 Total Operating Revenue $ 9,259 $ 10,700 $ (1,441 ) Power Delivery Business The following table categorizes Power Deliverys operating revenue by type of revenue. 2009 2008 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 1,653 $ 1,690 $ (37 ) Default Electricity Supply Revenue 2,990 3,413 (423 ) Other Electric Revenue 69 66 3 Total Electric Operating Revenue 4,712 5,169 (457 ) Regulated Gas Revenue 228 204 24 Other Gas Revenue 40 114 (74 ) Total Gas Operating Revenue 268 318 (50 ) Total Power Delivery Operating Revenue $ 4,980 $ 5,487 $ (507 ) Regulated Transmission & Distribution (T&D) Electric Revenue includes revenue from the delivery of electricity, including the delivery of Default Electricity Supply, by PHIs utility subsidiaries to customers within their service territories at regulated rates. Regulated T&D Electric Revenue also includes transmission service revenue that PHIs utility subsidiaries receive as transmission owners from PJM. Default Electricity Supply Revenue is the revenue received from the supply of electricity by PHIs electric utility subsidiaries at regulated rates to retail customers who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier, and which, depending on the jurisdiction, is also known as Standard Office Service (SOS) or Basic Generation Service (BGS). 45 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS The costs related to Default Electricity Supply are included in Fuel and Purchased Energy. Default Electricity Supply Revenue also includes revenue from Transition Bond Charges and other restructuring related revenues. Other Electric Revenue includes work and services performed on behalf of customers, including other utilities, which is generally not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of pole attachments, late payment fees, and collection fees. Regulated Gas Revenue consists of revenues for on system natural gas sales and the transportation of natural gas for customers by DPL within its service territory at regulated rates. Other Gas Revenue consists of DPLs off system natural gas sales and the short term release of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity not needed to serve customers. Off system sales are made possible when low demand for natural gas by regulated customers creates excess pipeline capacity. Regulated T&D Electric 2009 2008 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue Residential $ 596 $ 593 $ 3 Commercial and industrial 804 786 18 Other 253 311 (58 ) Total Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 1,653 $ 1,690 $ (37 ) Other Regulated T&D Electric Revenue consists primarily of: (i) transmission service revenue and (ii) revenue from the resale by Pepco in the PJM RTO market of energy and capacity purchased under a power purchase agreement between Panda Brandywine, L.P. (Panda) and Pepco (the Panda PPA) prior to the transfer of the Panda PPA to an unaffiliated third party in September 2008. 2009 2008 Change Regulated T&D Electric Sales (GWh) Residential 16,871 17,186 (315 ) Commercial and industrial 31,570 32,520 (950 ) Other 261 261 Total Regulated T&D Electric Sales 48,702 49,967 (1,265 ) 2009 2008 Change Regulated T&D Electric Customers (in thousands) Residential 1,623 1,612 11 Commercial and industrial 198 198 Other 2 2 Total Regulated T&D Electric Customers 1,823 1,812 11 46 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS The Pepco, DPL and ACE service territories are located within a corridor extending from the District of Columbia to southern New Jersey. These service territories are economically diverse and include key industries that contribute to the regional economic base. Commercial activity in the region includes banking and other professional services, government, insurance, real estate, shopping malls, casinos, stand alone construction, and tourism. Industrial activity in the region includes chemical, glass, pharmaceutical, steel manufacturing, food processing, and oil refining. Regulated T&D Electric Revenue decreased by $37 million primarily due to: A decrease of $53 million in Other Regulated T&D Electric Revenue (which is matched by a corresponding decrease in Fuel and Purchased Energy) due to the absence of revenues from the resale of energy and capacity purchased under the Panda PPA after September 2008. A decrease of $12 million due to lower non weather related customer usage. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $16 million due to a distribution rate increase (which is substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Deferred Electric Service Costs) as part of a higher New Jersey Societal Benefit Charge that became effective in June 2008. An increase of $15 million due to higher pass through revenue (which is substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Other Taxes) primarily the result of increases in utility taxes that are collected on behalf of taxing jurisdictions. Default Electricity Supply 2009 2008 Change Default Electricity Supply Revenue Residential $ 1,915 $ 1,882 $ 33 Commercial and industrial 915 1,200 (285 ) Other 160 331 (171 ) Total Default Electricity Supply Revenue $ 2,990 $ 3,413 $ (423 ) Other Default Electricity Supply Revenue consists primarily of revenue from the resale by ACE in the PJM RTO market of energy and capacity purchased under contracts with unaffiliated non utility generators (NUGs). 2009 2008 Change Default Electricity Supply Sales (Gigawatt hours (Gwh)) Residential 16,274 16,621 (347 ) Commercial and industrial 8,470 10,204 (1,734 ) Other 101 101 Total Default Electricity Supply Sales 24,845 26,926 (2,081 ) 47 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS 2009 2008 Change Default Electricity Supply Customers (in thousands) Residential 1,572 1,572 Commercial and industrial 159 167 (8 ) Other 2 2 Total Default Electricity Supply Customers 1,733 1,741 (8 ) Default Electricity Supply Revenue, decreased by $423 million primarily due to: A decrease of $175 million in wholesale energy revenues due to lower market prices for the sale of electricity purchased from NUGs. A decrease of $167 million due to lower sales, primarily the result of commercial customer migration to competitive suppliers. A decrease of $49 million due to lower non weather related customer usage. A decrease of $33 million due to lower sales as a result of milder weather primarily during the 2009 summer months as compared to 2008. The decrease in total Default Electricity Supply Revenue includes a decrease of $8 million in unbilled revenue attributable to ACEs BGS. Under the BGS terms approved by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU), ACE is entitled to recover from its customers all of its costs of providing BGS. If the costs of providing BGS exceed the BGS revenue, then the excess costs are deferred in Deferred Electric Service Costs. ACEs BGS unbilled revenue is not included in the deferral calculation, and therefore has an impact on the results of operations in the period during which it is accrued. While the change in the amount of unbilled revenue from year to year typically is not significant, for the year ended December 31, 2009, BGS unbilled revenue decreased by $8 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, which resulted in a $5 million decrease in PHIs net income. The decrease was due to increased customer migration and lower customer usage during the unbilled revenue period at the end of 2009 as compared to the corresponding period in 2008. Regulated Gas 2009 2008 Change Regulated Gas Revenue Residential $ 139 $ 121 $ 18 Commercial and industrial 81 75 6 Transportation and other 8 8 Total Regulated Gas Revenue $ 228 $ 204 $ 24 2009 2008 Change Regulated Gas Sales (billion cubic feet) Residential 8 7 1 Commercial and industrial 5 6 (1 ) Transportation and other 6 7 (1 ) Total Regulated Gas Sales 19 20 (1 ) 48 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS 2009 2008 Change Regulated Gas Customers (in thousands) Residential 113 113 Commercial and industrial 10 9 1 Transportation and other Total Regulated Gas Customers 123 122 1 DPLs natural gas service territory is located in New Castle County, Delaware. Several key industries contribute to the economic base as well as to growth: Commercial activity in the region includes banking and other professional services, government, insurance, real estate, shopping malls, stand alone construction, and tourism. Industrial activity in the region includes chemical and pharmaceutical. Regulated Gas Revenue increased by $24 million primarily due to: An increase of $15 million due to the Gas Cost Rate increase effective November 2008, partially offset by rate decreases in March 2009 and November 2009. An increase of $14 million (which is offset by a corresponding increase in Fuel and Purchased Energy) associated with the recognition of the unbilled portion of Gas Cost Rate revenue in 2009 which was not previously recognized. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $5 million due to lower non weather related customer usage. A decrease of $4 million due to lower sales as result of warmer weather during the fourth quarter of 2009 as compared to the corresponding period in 2008. Other Gas Revenue Other Gas Revenue decreased by $74 million primarily due to lower revenue from off system sales resulting from: A decrease of $67 million due to lower market prices. A decrease of $9 million due to lower demand from electric generators and gas marketers. Conectiv Energy The impact of Operating Revenue changes and Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales changes with respect to the Conectiv Energy component of the Competitive Energy business are encompassed within the discussion that follows. Operating Revenues of the Conectiv Energy segment are derived primarily from the sale of electricity. The primary components of its costs of sales are Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales. Because fuel and electricity prices tend to move in tandem, price changes in these commodities from period to period can have a significant impact on Operating Revenue, Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales without signifying any change in the performance of the Conectiv Energy segment. Conectiv Energy also uses a number of and various types of derivative contracts to lock in sales margins, 49 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS and to economically hedge its power and fuel purchases and sales. Gains and losses on derivative contracts are netted in Operating Revenue, Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales as appropriate under the applicable accounting rules. For these reasons, PHI from a managerial standpoint focuses on gross margin as a measure of performance. Conectiv Energy Gross Margin Merchant Generation and Load Service consists primarily of electric power, capacity and ancillary services sales from Conectiv Energys generating plants; tolling arrangements entered into to sell energy and other products from Conectiv Energys generating plants and to purchase energy and other products from generating plants of other companies; hedges of power, capacity, fuel and load; the sale of excess fuel (primarily natural gas); natural gas transportation and storage; emission allowances; electric power, capacity, and ancillary services sales pursuant to competitively bid contracts entered into with affiliated and non affiliated companies to fulfill their default electricity supply obligations; and fuel switching activities made possible by the multi fuel capabilities of some of Conectiv Energys generating plants. Energy Marketing activities consist primarily of wholesale natural gas and fuel oil marketing, the activities of the short term power desk, which generates margin by capturing price differences between power pools and locational and timing differences within a power pool, and power origination activities, which primarily represent the fixed margin component of structured power transactions such as default supply service. 50 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Conectiv Energy Gross Margin and Operating Statistics Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Change Operating Revenue ($ millions): Merchant Generation and Load Service $ 1,522 $ 1,846 $ (324 ) Energy Marketing 649 1,201 (552 ) Total Operating Revenue(a) $ 2,171 $ 3,047 $ (876 ) Cost of Sales ($ millions): Merchant Generation and Load Service $ 1,339 $ 1,492 $ (153 ) Energy Marketing 606 1,148 (542 ) Total Cost of Sales(b) $ 1,945 $ 2,640 $ (695 ) Gross Margin ($ millions): Merchant Generation and Load Service $ 183 $ 354 $ (171 ) Energy Marketing 43 53 (10 ) Total Gross Margin $ 226 $ 407 $ (181 ) Generation Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses ($ millions) (c): Generation Fuel Expenses (d),(e) Natural Gas $ 233 $ 223 $ 10 Coal 7 57 (50 ) Oil 24 46 (22 ) Other(f) 4 2 2 Total Generation Fuel Expenses $ 268 $ 328 $ (60 ) Purchased Power Expenses (e) $ 907 $ 992 $ (85 ) Statistics: Generation Output (Megawatt hours(MWh)): Base Load (g) 590,806 1,710,916 (1,120,110 ) Mid Merit (Combined Cycle) (h) 2,619,815 2,625,668 (5,853 ) Other (i) 41,521 74,254 (32,733 ) Peaking 34,120 78,450 (44,330 ) Tolled Generation 766,575 116,776 649,799 Total 4,052,837 4,606,064 (553,227 ) Load Service Volume (MWh) (j) 6,294,042 10,717,149 (4,423,107 ) Average Power Sales Price (k) ($/MWh): Generation Sales (d) $ 48.51 $ 109.71 $ (61.20 ) Non Generation Sales (l) $ 87.86 $ 92.27 $ (4.41 ) Total $ 72.57 $ 97.08 $ (24.51 ) Average on peak spot power price at PJM East Hub ($/MWh) (m) $ 47.39 $ 91.73 $ (44.34 ) Average around the clock spot power price at PJM East Hub ($/MWh) (m) $ 41.23 $ 77.15 $ (35.92 ) Average spot natural gas price at market area M3 ($/MMBtu)(n) $ 4.64 $ 9.83 $ (5.19 ) Weather (degree days at Philadelphia Airport): (o) Heating degree days 4,533 4,403 130 Cooling degree days 1,228 1,354 (126 ) (a) Includes $310 million and $397 million of affiliate transactions for 2009 and 2008, respectively.

(o) Source: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Weather Service data. 51 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Conectiv Energys Operating Revenue and cost of sales were lower in 2009 primarily due to decreased generating facility output and lower default electricity supply volumes, in each case due to a decreased demand for power and lower spark and dark spreads driven by the economic recession, milder weather and the mix of contracts that were in effect each year. Conectiv Energys ability to use its fleet of mid merit and peaking generation assets to generate high gross margins during peak usage periods was limited by the low energy commodity prices. Merchant Generation and Load Service gross margin decreased approximately $171 million primarily due to: A decrease of approximately $133 million in gross margin derived from reduced spark and dark spreads (lower by 57%), and lower run time (lower by 27% excluding tolled generation). A decrease of approximately $106 million in gross margin primarily attributable to economic fuel hedges that were favorable in a rising market during the first half of 2008 and unfavorable in a falling market throughout 2009. An increase of approximately $66 million due to higher gross margin attributable to capacity sales, primarily due to higher RPM clearing prices in the eastern part of the PJM RTO region. Energy Marketing gross margin decreased approximately $10 million primarily due to lower natural gas marketing results primarily due to lower prices and demand. Pepco Energy Services Pepco Energy Services operating revenue decreased $265 million primarily due to: A $170 million decrease due to lower volumes of retail electric load served as a result of the expiration of existing retail contracts. A $72 million decrease due to lower construction activities as a result of reduced high voltage construction and maintenance projects. A $20 million decrease due to lower retail natural gas prices partially offset by higher customer load as a result of customer acquisitions. A $3 million decrease due to lower generation output as a result of milder weather and lower overall load levels for the PJM RTO control area. Other Non Regulated Other Non Regulated revenues increased by $111 million from a $60 million loss in 2008 to a $51 million gain in 2009. This was primarily the result of a non cash charge of $124 million that was recorded in the quarter ended June 30, 2008 as a result of revised assumptions regarding the estimated timing of tax benefits from PCIs cross border energy lease investments. In accordance with FASB guidance on leases (ASC 840), the charge was recorded as a reduction to lease revenue from these transactions, which is included in Other Non Regulated revenues. 52 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Operating Expenses Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales A detail of PHIs consolidated Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales is as follows: 2009 2008 Change Power Delivery $ 3,243 $ 3,578 $ (335 ) Conectiv Energy 1,945 2,640 (695 ) Pepco Energy Services 2,179 2,489 (310 ) Corporate and Other (318 ) (418 ) 100 Total $ 7,049 $ 8,289 $ (1,240 ) Power Delivery Business Power Deliverys Fuel and Purchased Energy (other than expense associated with Regulated Gas Revenue and Other Gas revenue) consists of the cost of electricity purchased by its utility subsidiaries to fulfill their respective Default Electricity Supply obligations and, as such, is recoverable from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders. Fuel and Purchased Energy expense decreased by $335 million primarily due to: A decrease of $236 million primarily due to commercial customer migration to competitive suppliers. A decrease of $73 million in the cost of gas purchases for off systems sales, the result of lower average gas prices and volumes purchased. A decrease of $53 million (which is matched by a corresponding decrease in Other Regulated T&D Electric Revenue) due to the transfer of the Panda PPA. A decrease of $33 million due to lower electricity sales as a result of milder weather primarily during the 2009 summer months as compared to 2008. A decrease of $30 million in the cost of gas purchases for system sales, the result of lower average gas prices and volumes purchased. A decrease of $23 million due to lower average electricity costs under Default Electricity Supply contracts. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $63 million due to a higher rate of recovery of electricity supply costs resulting in a decrease in the Default Electricity Supply deferral balance. An increase of $43 million from the settlement of financial hedges entered into as part of DPLs hedge program for regulated natural gas. An increase of $12 million due to a higher rate of recovery of natural gas supply costs primarily as a result of recognizing the unbilled portion of Gas Cost Rate revenue in 2009, as discussed under Regulated Gas Revenue. 53 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Conectiv Energy The impact of Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales changes with respect to the Conectiv Energy component of the Competitive Energy business is encompassed within the prior discussion under the heading Conectiv Energy Gross Margin. Pepco Energy Services Pepco Energy Services Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales decreased $310 million primarily due to: A $212 million decrease due to lower volumes of electricity purchased to serve decreased retail customer load as the result of the continuing expiration of existing retail contracts. A $45 million decrease due to lower wholesale natural gas prices partially offset by higher retail customer load as the result of customer acquisitions. A $42 million decrease due to lower construction activities as a result of reduced high voltage construction and maintenance projects. A $11 million decrease due to lower generation output due to milder weather and lower overall load levels for the PJM control area. Other Operation and Maintenance A detail of PHIs other operation and maintenance expense is as follows: 2009 2008 Change Power Delivery $ 752 $ 702 $ 50 Conectiv Energy 133 143 (10 ) Pepco Energy Services 90 87 3 Other Non Regulated 2 2 Corporate and Other (28 ) (17 ) (11 ) Total $ 949 $ 917 $ 32 Other Operation and Maintenance expense for Power Delivery increased by $50 million; however, excluding a decrease of $5 million primarily related to administrative expenses that are deferred and recoverable in Default Electricity Supply Revenue, Other Operation and Maintenance expense increased by $55 million. The $55 million increase was primarily due to: An increase of $39 million in employee related costs, primarily due to higher pension and other postretirement benefit expenses. An increase of $13 million primarily due to higher preventative and corrective maintenance, and emergency restoration costs. An increase of $4 million in regulatory expenses primarily incurred in connection with the District of Columbia distribution rate case. An increase of $3 million due to higher non deferrable bad debt expenses. 54 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS During 2008, PHI recorded adjustments, on a consolidated basis, to correct errors in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses for prior periods dating back to February 2005 during which (i) customer late payment fees were incorrectly recognized and (ii) stock based compensation expense related to certain restricted stock awards granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan was understated. The late payment fees and stock based compensation adjustments resulted in increases in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 of $6 million and $9 million, respectively. These adjustments were not considered material either individually or in the aggregate. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and Amortization expenses increased by $14 million to $391 million in 2009 from $377 million in 2008 primarily due to an increase of $17 million due to generating plant additions and $4 million due to the accelerated depreciation of generating plants, partially offset by a decrease of $7 million due to lower amortization by ACE of stranded costs primarily as the result of lower revenue due to decreases in the Market Transition Charge Tax rate in October 2009 and October 2008 (partially offset in Default Electricity Supply Revenue). Other Taxes Other Taxes increased by $13 million to $372 million in 2009 from $359 million in 2008. The increase was primarily due to increased pass throughs experienced by Power Delivery (which are substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue) resulting from rate increases in utility taxes imposed by the taxing jurisdictions. Deferred Electric Service Costs Deferred Electric Service Costs, which relate only to ACE, decreased by $152 million, to an expense reduction of $161 million in 2009 as compared to an expense reduction of $9 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to: A decrease of $186 million due to a lower rate of recovery of costs from the resale in the PJM RTO market of energy and capacity purchased under the NUG contracts. The decrease was partially offset by: An increase of $15 million due to a higher rate of recovery through customer rates of deferred energy costs of Default Electricity Supply (included in Default Electricity Supply Revenue). An increase of $13 million due to a higher rate of recovery through customer rates of New Jersey Societal Benefit program costs (included in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue). An increase of $5 million due to a higher rate of recovery through customer rates of deferred transmission costs of Default Electricity Supply (included in Default Electricity Supply Revenue). Effect of Settlement of Mirant Bankruptcy Claims In September 2008, Pepco transferred the Panda PPA to an unaffiliated third party. In March 2009, the DCPSC approved an allocation between Pepco and its District of Columbia customers of the District of Columbia portion of the Mirant bankruptcy settlement proceeds remaining after the transfer of the Panda PPA. As a result, Pepco recorded a pre tax gain of $14 million reflecting the District of Columbia proceeds retained by Pepco. In July 2009, the MPSC approved an allocation between Pepco and its Maryland customers of the Maryland portion of the Mirant bankruptcy settlement proceeds remaining after the transfer of the Panda PPA. As a result, Pepco recorded a pre tax gain of $26 million reflecting the Maryland proceeds retained by Pepco. 55 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Gain on Sale of Assets Gain on Sale of Assets decreased by $3 million in 2009 due to a $3 million gain on the sale of the Virginia retail electric distribution and wholesale transmission assets in January 2008. Other Income (Expenses) Other Expenses (which are net of Other Income) increased by $50 million to a net expense of $350 million in 2009 from a net expense of $300 million in 2008, primarily due to an increase in interest expense. The increase in interest expense was due to a $33 million increase in interest expense on long term debt as the result of a higher amount of outstanding debt, and an increase of $13 million in interest expense on short term debt due primarily to the Pepco Energy Services credit intermediation agreement, as described below under the heading Capital Resources and Liquidity Collateral Requirements of the Competitive Energy Business. Income Tax Expense PHIs consolidated effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were 31.9 % and 35.9% respectively. The decrease in the rate primarily resulted from a refund of $6 million (after tax) of state income taxes and the establishment of a state tax benefit carryforward of $7 million (after tax) related to a change in the tax reporting for the disposition of certain assets in prior years, and from the 2008 charge related to the cross border energy lease investments described in Note (17), Commitments and Contingencies, and corresponding state tax benefits related to the charge. The following results of operations discussion is for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. All amounts in the tables (except sales and customers) are in millions of dollars. Operating Revenue A detail of the components of PHIs consolidated operating revenue is as follows: 2008 2007 Change Power Delivery $ 5,487 $ 5,244 $ 243 Conectiv Energy 3,047 2,206 841 Pepco Energy Services 2,648 2,309 339 Other Non Regulated (60 ) 76 (136 ) Corporate and Other (422 ) (469 ) 47 Total Operating Revenue $ 10,700 $ 9,366 $ 1,334 56 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Power Delivery Business The following table categorizes Power Deliverys operating revenue by type of revenue. 2008 2007 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 1,690 $ 1,592 $ 98 Default Electricity Supply Revenue 3,413 3,295 118 Other Electric Revenue 66 66 Total Electric Operating Revenue 5,169 4,953 216 Regulated Gas Revenue 204 211 (7 ) Other Gas Revenue 114 80 34 Total Gas Operating Revenue 318 291 27 Total Power Delivery Operating Revenue $ 5,487 $ 5,244 $ 243 Regulated T&D Electric Revenue includes revenue from the delivery of electricity, including the delivery of Default Electricity Supply, by PHIs utility subsidiaries to customers within their service territories at regulated rates. Regulated T&D Electric Revenue also includes transmission service revenue that PHIs utility subsidiaries receive as transmission owners from PJM. Default Electricity Supply Revenue is the revenue received from the supply of electricity by PHIs electric utility subsidiaries at regulated rates to retail customers who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier, and which, depending on the jurisdiction, is also known as SOS or BGS service. The costs related to Default Electricity Supply are included in Fuel and Purchased Energy. Default Electricity Supply Revenue also includes revenue from transition bond charges and other restructuring related revenues. Other Electric Revenue includes work and services performed on behalf of customers, including other utilities, which is not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of pole attachments, late payment fees, and collection fees. Regulated Gas Revenue consists of revenues from on system natural gas sales and the transportation of natural gas for customers by DPL within its service territories at regulated rates. Other Gas Revenue consists of DPLs off system natural gas sales and the short term release of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity not needed to serve customers. Off system sales are made possible when low demand for natural gas by regulated customers creates excess pipeline capacity. In response to an order issued by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) regarding changes to ACEs retail transmission rates, ACE has established deferred accounting treatment for the difference between the rates that ACE is authorized to charge its customers for the transmission of Default Electricity Supply and the cost that ACE incurs. Under the deferral arrangement, any over or under recovery is deferred as part of Deferred Electric Service Costs pending an adjustment of retail rates in a future proceeding. As a consequence of the order, effective January 1, 2008, ACEs retail transmission revenue is being recorded as Default Electricity Supply Revenue, rather than as Regulated T&D Electric Revenue, thereby conforming to the practice of PHIs other utility subsidiaries, which previously established deferred accounting treatment for any over or under recovery of retail transmission rates relative to the cost incurred. ACEs retail transmission revenue for the period prior to January 1, 2008 has been reclassified to Default Electricity Supply Revenue in order to conform to the current period presentation. 57 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Regulated T&D Electric Regulated T&D Electric Revenue 2008 2007 Change Residential $ 593 $ 580 $ 13 Commercial and industrial 786 750 36 Other 311 262 49 Total Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 1,690 $ 1,592 $ 98 Other Regulated T&D Electric Revenue consists primarily of: (i) transmission service revenue and (ii) revenue from the resale by Pepco in the PJM RTO market of energy and capacity purchased under the Panda PPA prior to the transfer of the Panda PPA to an unaffiliated third party in September 2008.

Other Gas Revenue Other Gas Revenue, which is substantially offset in Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales, increased by $34 million primarily due to revenue from higher off system sales, the result of an increase in market prices. Conectiv Energy The impact of Operating Revenue changes and Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales changes with respect to the Conectiv Energy component of the Competitive Energy business are encompassed within the discussion that follows. Operating Revenues of the Conectiv Energy segment are derived primarily from the sale of electricity. The primary components of its costs of sales are Fuel and Purchased Power and Other Services Cost of Sales. Because fuel and electricity prices tend to move in tandem, price changes in these commodities from period to period can have a significant impact on Operating Revenue and costs of sales without signifying any change in the performance of the Conectiv Energy segment. Conectiv Energy also uses a number of and various types of derivative contracts to lock in sales margins, and to economically hedge its power and fuel purchases and sales. Gains and losses on derivative contracts are netted in Operating Revenue and cost of sales as appropriate under the applicable accounting rules. For these reasons, PHI from a managerial standpoint focuses on gross margin as a measure of performance. 61 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Conectiv Energy Gross Margin Merchant Generation and Load Service consists primarily of electric power, capacity and ancillary services sales from Conectiv Energys generating plants; tolling arrangements entered into to sell energy and other products from Conectiv Energys generating plants and to purchase energy and other products from generating plants of other companies; hedges of power, capacity, fuel and load; the sale of excess fuel (primarily natural gas); natural gas transportation and storage; emission allowances; electric power, capacity, and ancillary services sales pursuant to competitively bid contracts entered into with affiliated and non affiliated companies to fulfill their default electricity supply obligations; and fuel switching activities made possible by the multi fuel capabilities of some of Conectiv Energys generating plants. Energy Marketing activities consist primarily of wholesale natural gas and fuel oil marketing, the activities of the short term power desk, which generates margin by capturing price differences between power pools and locational and timing differences within a power pool, and power origination activities, which primarily represent the fixed margin component of structured power transactions such as default supply service. 62 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Conectiv Energy Gross Margin and Operating Statistics Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Change Operating Revenue ($ millions): Merchant Generation and Load Service $ 1,846 $ 1,087 $ 759 Energy Marketing 1,201 1,119 82 Total Operating Revenue(a) $ 3,047 $ 2,206 $ 841 Cost of Sales ($ millions): Merchant Generation and Load Service $ 1,492 $ 806 $ 686 Energy Marketing 1,148 1,081 67 Total Cost of Sales(b) $ 2,640 $ 1,887 $ 753 Gross Margin ($ millions): Merchant Generation and Load Service $ 354 $ 281 $ 73 Energy Marketing 53 38 15 Total Gross Margin $ 407 $ 319 $ 88 Generation Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses ($ millions) (c): Generation Fuel Expenses (d),(e) Natural Gas $ 223 $ 268 $ (45 ) Coal 57 62 (5 ) Oil 46 34 12 Other(f) 2 2 Total Generation Fuel Expenses $ 328 $ 366 $ (38 ) Purchased Power Expenses (e) $ 992 $ 480 $ 512 Statistics: Generation Output (Megawatt hours(MWh)): Base Load (g) 1,710,916 2,232,499 (521,583 ) Mid Merit (Combined Cycle) (h) 2,625,668 3,341,716 (716,048 ) Other (i) 74,254 190,253 (115,999 ) Peaking 78,450 146,486 (68,036 ) Tolled Generation 116,776 160,755 (43,979 ) Total 4,606,064 6,071,709 (1,465,645 ) Load Service Volume (MWh) (j) 10,717,149 7,075,743 3,641,406 Average Power Sales Price (k)($/MWh): Generation Sales (d) $ 109.71 $ 82.19 $ 27.52 Non Generation Sales (l) $ 92.27 $ 70.43 $ 21.84 Total $ 97.08 $ 74.34 $ 22.74 Average on peak spot power price at PJM East Hub ($/MWh) (m) $ 91.73 $ 77.85 $ 13.88 Average around the clock spot power price at PJM East Hub ($/MWh) (m) $ 77.15 $ 63.92 $ 13.23 Average spot natural gas price at market area M3 ($/MMBtu)(n) $ 9.83 $ 7.76 $ 2.07 Weather (degree days at Philadelphia Airport): (o) Heating degree days 4,403 4,560 (157 ) Cooling degree days 1,354 1,513 (159 ) (a) Includes $397 million and $442 million of affiliate transactions for 2008 and 2007, respectively.

In 2008, Conectiv Energy expanded its default electricity supply business into ISONE. Conectiv Energys margins were favorably impacted by higher energy commodity prices in the first half of 2008, and unfavorably impacted by the decrease in prices and spark spreads during the second half of the year. Volatile commodity prices contributed to significant movements in the value of transactions accounted for at fair value. Merchant Generation and Load Service gross margin increased approximately $73 million primarily due to: An increase of approximately $37 million primarily due to short term sales of firm natural gas, and natural gas transportation and storage rights, the dual fuel capability of the combined cycle mid merit units (fuel switching), cross commodity hedging (use of natural gas to hedge power positions), and the opportunities created by the mid merit combined cycle units operating flexibility (option value) in conjunction with short term power and fuel price volatility. This combination of strategies positioned Conectiv Energy to realize the upside potential of its overall portfolio during the winter period. The magnitude of gain was due partly to significant fuel price increases in conjunction with less significant increases in power prices. An increase of approximately $46 million due to higher PJM capacity prices net of capacity hedges. An increase of approximately $18 million due to the application of fair value accounting treatment and associated settlements with respect to excess coal hedges. A decrease of approximately $15 million due to a lower of cost or market adjustment to the value of oil inventory held at the generating plants at year end 2008. A decrease of approximately $15 million due to lower sales of emissions allowances. Energy Marketing gross margin increased approximately $15 million primarily due to: An increase of approximately $9 million in short term power desk margins in 2008. An increase of approximately $9 million due to additional default electricity supply contracts in 2008. A decrease of approximately $4 million due to lower wholesale gas margins. Pepco Energy Services Pepco Energy Services operating revenue increased by $339 million to $2,648 million in 2008 from $2,309 million in 2007 primarily due to: An increase of $259 million due to higher volumes of retail electric load served due to customer acquisitions and higher prices in 2008. An increase of $64 million due to higher natural gas volumes driven by customer acquisitions and higher prices in 2008. An increase of $26 million due to increased construction activities in 2008. 64 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $11 million due to RPM related charges that lowered capacity revenues for the generating plants. Other Non regulated Other Non regulated operating revenue decreased by $136 million primarily due to: A non cash charge of $124 million recorded during 2008 as a result of revised assumptions regarding the estimated timing of tax benefits from PCIs cross border energy lease investments. This charge was recorded as a reduction to lease revenue from these transactions, which is included in Other Non regulated revenues.

An increase of $32 million in the cost of gas purchases for off system sales, the result of higher average gas prices. An increase of $24 million for energy and capacity purchased under the Panda PPA. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $61 million primarily due to commercial and industrial customer migration to competitive suppliers. A decrease of $60 million due to lower electricity sales as a result of milder weather during 2008 as compared to 2007. A decrease of $45 million due to the sale of Virginia retail electric distribution and wholesale transmission assets in January 2008. 65 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Fuel and Purchased Energy expense is substantially offset in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue, Default Electricity Supply Revenue, Regulated Gas Revenue and Other Gas Revenue.

England electric generating facility prior to its sale in February 2007, Other Operation and Maintenance expenses increased by $38 million. The $38 million increase was primarily due to: An increase of $17 million in deferred administrative expenses associated with Default Electricity Supply (offset in Default Supply Revenue) due to (i) the inclusion of $10 million of customer late payment fees in the calculation of the deferral and (ii) a higher rate of recovery of bad debt and administrative expenses as a result of an increase in Default Electricity Supply revenue rates. See the discussion below regarding a 2008 correction of errors in recording customer late payment fees, including $6 million related to prior periods. An increase of $11 million due to higher bad debt expenses associated with distribution and Default Electricity Supply customers, of which approximately $6 million was deferred. 66 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS An increase of $9 million in employee related costs primarily due to the recording of additional stock based compensation expense as discussed below, including $6 million related to prior periods. An increase of $3 million in Demand Side Management program costs (offset in Deferred Electric Service Costs). An increase of $3 million in legal expenses. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $3 million in corrective and preventative maintenance and emergency restoration costs. A decrease of $4 million in regulatory expenses primarily due to higher expenses in 2007 relating to the District of Columbia distribution rate case. A decrease of $3 million due to higher construction project write offs in 2007 related to customer requested work. A decrease of $2 million in accounting services related to tax consulting fees. Other Operation and Maintenance expense for Conectiv Energy increased by $16 million primarily due to increased planned maintenance at its generating plants. Other Operation and Maintenance expense for Pepco Energy Services increased by $13 million due to increased compensation, benefit, outside contractor and regulatory costs related to growth in its businesses. During 2008, PHI recorded adjustments, on a consolidated basis, to correct errors in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses for prior periods dating back to February 2005 during which (i) customer late payment fees were incorrectly recognized and (ii) stock based compensation expense related to certain restricted stock awards granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan was understated. The late payment fees and stock based compensation adjustments resulted in increases in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 of $6 million and $9 million, respectively. These adjustments were not considered material either individually or in the aggregate. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and Amortization expenses increased by $11 million to $377 million in 2008 from $366 million in 2007. The increase was primarily due to: An increase of $21 million due to higher amortization by ACE of stranded costs as a result of an October 2007 Transition Bond Charge rate increase (offset in Default Electricity Supply Revenue) An increase of $7 million due to utility plant additions. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $15 million due to a change in depreciation rates in accordance with the 2007 Maryland Rate Orders. 67 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Deferred Electric Service Costs Deferred Electric Service Costs, which relate only to ACE, decreased by $77 million, to an expense reduction of $9 million in 2008 as compared to an expense increase of $68 million in 2007. The decrease was primarily due to: A decrease of $46 million due to a lower rate of recovery of deferred energy costs. A decrease of $29 million due to a lower rate of recovery of costs from energy and capacity purchased under the NUG contracts. A decrease of $17 million due to a lower rate of recovery of deferred transmission costs. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $15 million primarily due to a higher rate of recovery of New Jersey Societal Benefit program costs. Deferred Electric Service Costs are substantially offset in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue, Default Electricity Supply Revenue, Fuel and Purchased Energy, and Other Operation and Maintenance. Impairment Losses During 2008, Pepco Holdings recorded pre tax impairment losses of $2 million ($1 million after tax) related to a joint venture investment owned by Conectiv Energy. During 2007, Pepco Holdings recorded pre tax impairment losses of $2 million ($1 million after tax) related to certain energy services business assets owned by Pepco Energy Services. Effect of Settlement of Mirant Bankruptcy Claims The Effect of Settlement of Mirant Bankruptcy Claims reflects the recovery in 2007 of $33 million in operating expenses and certain other costs as damages in the Mirant bankruptcy settlement. See Capital Resources and Liquidity Cash Flow Activity Proceeds from Settlement of Mirant Bankruptcy Claims herein. Other Income (Expenses) Other Expenses (which are net of Other Income) increased by $16 million to a net expense of $300 million in 2008 from a net expense of $284 million in 2007 due to: A decrease of $15 million in income from equity investments. A decrease of $5 million in Contribution in Aid of Construction tax gross up income. The aggregate amount of these decreases in income was partially offset by: A net decrease of $10 million in interest expense. Income Tax Expense PHIs consolidated effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were 35.9% and 36.0%, respectively. While the change in the effective rate between 2008 and 2007 was minimal, the effective rate in each year was impacted by certain non recurring items. In 2008, PHI recorded certain tax benefits that 68 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS reduced its overall effective tax rate, primarily representing net interest income accrued on effectively settled and uncertain tax positions (including interest related to the settlements with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the like kind exchange issue and the tentative settlement of the mixed service cost issue, as discussed below, and a claim made with the IRS related to ACEs tax reporting of fuel over and under recoveries), interest income received in 2008 on the Maryland state tax refund referred to below, and deferred tax adjustments related to additional analysis of its deferred tax balances completed in 2008. These benefits were partially offset by limited federal and state tax benefits related to the charge taken on the cross border energy lease investments in the second quarter of 2008. In 2007, PHI recorded the receipt of Pepcos Maryland state tax refund in the third quarter of 2007 as a reduction in income tax expense. During the second quarter 2008, PHI reached a tentative settlement with the IRS concerning the treatment by Pepco, DPL and ACE of mixed service construction costs for income tax purposes during the period 2001 to 2004. On the basis of the tentative settlement, PHI updated its estimated liability related to mixed service costs and, as a result, recorded a net reduction in its liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $19 million and recognized after tax interest income of $7 million in the second quarter of 2008. See Note (17), Commitments and Contingencies Regulatory and Other Matters IRS Mixed Service Cost Issue, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. During the fourth quarter of 2008, PHI reached a final settlement with the IRS concerning a transaction between Conectiv and an unaffiliated third party that was treated by Conectiv as a like kind exchange under Internal Revenue Code Section 1031. PHIs reserve for this issue was more conservative than the actual settlement and resulted in the reversal of a total of $5 million (after tax) in excess accrued interest related to this matter in the fourth quarter of 2008. Capital Resources and Liquidity This section discusses Pepco Holdings working capital, cash flow activity, capital requirements and other uses and sources of capital. Working Capital At December 31, 2009, Pepco Holdings current assets on a consolidated basis totaled $1.9 billion and its current liabilities totaled $2.3 billion. At December 31, 2008, Pepco Holdings current assets on a consolidated basis totaled $2.6 billion and its current liabilities totaled $2 billion. The decrease in working capital from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009 is primarily due to a $300 million pension plan contribution and a $451 million increase in current maturities of long term debt. At December 31, 2009, Pepco Holdings cash and current cash equivalents totaled $46 million, of which $22 million was invested in money market funds that invest in U.S. Treasury obligations, and the balance was held as cash and uncollected funds. Current restricted cash equivalents (cash that is available to be used only for designated purposes) totaled $11 million. At December 31, 2008, Pepco Holdings cash and current cash equivalents totaled $384 million and its current restricted cash equivalents totaled $10 million. PHI expects the working capital deficit will be funded during 2010 through cash flow from operations, reduced collateral requirements of the Pepco Energy Services retail electric services business, delayed capital expenditures related to the MAPP project, and the refinancing of long term debt currently due within a year. 69 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS A detail of PHIs short term debt balance and its current maturities of long term debt and project funding balance follows.

The aggregate borrowing limit under this credit facility is $1.5 billion, all or any portion of which may be used to obtain loans or to issue letters of credit. PHIs credit limit under the facility is $875 million. The credit limit of each of Pepco, DPL and ACE is the lesser of $500 million and the maximum amount of debt the company is permitted to have outstanding by its regulatory authorities, except that the aggregate amount of credit used by Pepco, DPL and ACE at any given time collectively may not exceed $625 million. The interest rate payable by each company on utilized funds is, at the borrowing companys election, (i) the greater of the prevailing prime rate and the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% or (ii) the prevailing Eurodollar rate, plus a margin that varies according to the credit rating of the borrower. The facility also includes a swingline loan sub facility pursuant to which each company may make same day borrowings in an aggregate amount not to exceed $150 million. Any swingline loan must be repaid by the borrower within seven days of receipt thereof. The facility commitment expiration date is May 5, 2012, with each company having the right to elect to have 100% of the principal balance of the loans outstanding on the expiration date continued as non revolving term loans for a period of one year from such expiration date. 70 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS The facility is intended to serve primarily as a source of liquidity to support the commercial paper programs of the respective companies. The companies also are permitted to use the facility to borrow funds for general corporate purposes and issue letters of credit. In order for a borrower to use the facility, certain representations and warranties must be true and correct, and the borrower must be in compliance with specified covenants, including (i) the requirement that each borrowing company maintain a ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization of 65% or less, computed in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement, which calculation excludes from the definition of total indebtedness certain trust preferred securities and deferrable interest subordinated debt (not to exceed 15% of total capitalization), (ii) a restriction on sales or other dispositions of assets, other than certain sales and dispositions, and (iii) a restriction on the incurrence of liens on the assets of a borrower or any of its significant subsidiaries other than permitted liens. The absence of a material adverse change in the borrowers business, property, and results of operations or financial condition is not a condition to the availability of credit under the facility. The facility does not include any rating triggers. In November 2008, PHI entered into a second unsecured credit facility in the amount of $400 million with a syndicate of nine lenders, which was amended and restated in October 2009, to extend the facility termination date to October 15, 2010. Under this facility, PHI may obtain revolving loans and swingline loans over the term of the facility. The facility does not provide for the issuance of letters of credit. The interest rate payable on funds borrowed under the facility is, at PHIs election, based on either (a) the prevailing Eurodollar rate or (b) the highest of (i) the prevailing prime rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% or (iii) the one month Eurodollar rate plus 1.0%, plus a margin that varies according to the credit rating of PHI. Under the swingline loan sub facility, PHI may obtain loans for up to seven days in an aggregate principal amount which does not exceed 10% of the aggregate borrowing limit under the facility. In order to obtain loans under the facility, PHI must be in compliance with the same covenants and conditions that it is required to satisfy for utilization of the $1.5 billion credit facility. The absence of a material adverse change in PHIs business, property, and results of operations or financial condition is not a condition to the availability of credit under the facility. The facility does not include any rating triggers. These two facilities are referred to herein collectively as PHIs primary credit facilities. As of December 31, 2009, each borrower was in compliance with the covenants of each of the primary credit facilities.

To address the challenges posed by the capital and credit market environment and to ensure that PHI and its subsidiaries continued to have sufficient access to cash to meet their liquidity needs, PHI and its subsidiaries undertook a number of actions during 2009: In March 2009, Pepco resold $110 million of its Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds, which previously had been issued for the benefit of Pepco by the Maryland Economic Development Corporation. In March 2009, Pepco Energy Services entered into a credit intermediation arrangement with an investment banking firm to reduce the collateral requirements associated with its retail energy sales business (see Collateral Requirements of the Competitive Energy Business). In May 2009, PHI entered into a $50 million, 18 month bi lateral credit agreement, which can only be used for the purpose of obtaining letters of credit. In October 2009, PHI amended its $400 million unsecured credit facility to extend the facility termination date to October 15, 2010. Collateral Requirements of the Competitive Energy Business In conducting its retail energy supply business, Pepco Energy Services, during periods of declining energy prices, is exposed to the asymmetrical risk of having to post collateral under its wholesale purchase contracts without receiving a corresponding amount of collateral from its retail customers. To partially address these asymmetrical collateral obligations, Pepco Energy Services, in the first quarter of 2009, entered into a credit intermediation arrangement with Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. (MSCG). Under this arrangement, MSCG, in consideration for the payment to MSCG of certain fees, (i) has assumed by novation the electricity purchase obligations of Pepco Energy Services in years 2009 through 2011 under several wholesale purchase contracts and (ii) has agreed to supply electricity to Pepco Energy Services on the same terms as the novated transactions, but without imposing on Pepco Energy Services any obligation to post collateral based on changes in electricity prices. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 17% of Pepco Energy Services wholesale electricity purchase obligations (measured in megawatt hours) were covered by this credit intermediation arrangement with MSCG. The fees in the amount of $25 million incurred by Pepco Energy Services in connection with the entry into this agreement are being amortized into expense in declining amounts over the life of the arrangement based on the fair value of the underlying contracts at the time of the novation. For the year ended December 31, 2009, approximately $16 million of the fees have been amortized. As the retail electric and natural gas supply business are wound down, Pepco Energy Services collateral requirements will be further reduced. In addition to Pepco Energy Services retail energy supply business, Conectiv Energy and Pepco Energy Services in the ordinary course of business enter into various contracts to buy and sell electricity, fuels and related products, including derivative instruments, designed to reduce their financial exposure to changes in the value of their assets and obligations due to energy price fluctuations. These contracts also typically have collateral requirements. Depending on the contract terms, the collateral required to be posted by Pepco Energy Services and Conectiv Energy can be of varying forms, including cash and letters of credit. As of December 31, 2009, Pepco Energy Services and Conectiv Energy had posted net cash collateral of $123 million and $240 million, respectively, and letters of credit of $157 million and $22 million, respectively. At December 31, 2008, Pepco Energy Services and Conectiv Energy had posted net cash collateral of $125 million and $206 million, respectively, and letters of credit of $474 million and $84 million, respectively. 72 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the amount of cash, plus borrowing capacity under the PHI credit facilities available to meet the future liquidity needs of the Competitive Energy business totaled $820 million and $684 million, respectively. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans PHI and its subsidiaries sponsor pension and postretirement benefit plans for their employees. The pension and postretirement benefit plans experienced significant declines in the fair value of plan assets in 2008, which has resulted in increased pension and postretirement benefit costs in 2009 and increased plan funding requirements. Based on the results of the 2009 actuarial valuation, PHIs net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs were approximately $149 million in 2009 versus $64 million in 2008. The current estimate of benefit cost for 2010 is $116 million. The utility subsidiaries are generally responsible for approximately 80% to 85% of the total PHI net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs. Approximately 30% of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs are capitalized. PHI estimates that its net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit expense will be approximately $80 million in 2010, as compared to $103 million in 2009 and $44 million in 2008. Pension benefits are provided under PHIs defined benefit pension plan (the PHI Retirement Plan), a non contributory retirement plan that covers substantially all employees of Pepco, DPL and ACE and certain employees of other PHI subsidiaries. PHIs funding policy with regard to the PHI Retirement Plan is to maintain a funding level that is at least equal to the funding target as defined under the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The funding target under the Pension Protection Act is an amount that is being phased in over time, and will reach 100% of accrued pension liability by 2011. The funding target was 94% of the accrued liability for 2009 and is 96% of the accrued liability for 2010. During 2009, PHI has made discretionary tax deductible contributions totaling $300 million to the PHI Retirement Plan, which brought plan assets to at least the funding target level for 2009 under the Pension Protection Act. Of this amount, $240 million was contributed through tax deductible contributions from Pepco, ACE and DPL in the amounts of $170 million, $60 million and $10 million, respectively. The remaining $60 million contribution was made through tax deductible contributions from the PHI Service Company. In 2008, no contributions were made to the PHI Retirement Plan. Under the Pension Protection Act, if a plan incurs a funding shortfall in the preceding plan year, there can be required minimum quarterly contributions in the current and following plan years. PHI satisfied the minimum required contribution rules in 2008 and 2009 and does not expect to have any required contributions in 2010. Although PHI projects there will be no minimum funding requirement under the Pension Protection Act guidelines in 2010, PHI currently estimates it may make discretionary tax deductible contributions in 2010 of approximately $100 million to bring its plan assets to at least the funding target level for 2010 under the Pension Protection Act. For additional discussion of PHIs Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, see Note (10), Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 73 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Cash Flow Activity PHIs cash flows for 2009, 2008, and 2007 are summarized below: Cash (Use) Source 2009 2008 2007 (millions of dollars) Operating Activities $ 606 $ 413 $ 795 Investing Activities (860 ) (714 ) (582 ) Financing Activities (84 ) 630 (207 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (338 ) $ 329 $ 6 Operating Activities Cash flows from operating activities are summarized below for 2009, 2008, and 2007: Cash Source (Use) 2009 2008 2007 (millions of dollars) Net Income $ 235 $ 300 $ 334 Non cash adjustments to net income 356 405 252 Pension contributions (300 ) Changes in cash collateral related to derivative activities (11 ) (274 ) 62 Changes in other assets and liabilities 326 (18 ) 147 Net cash from operating activities $ 606 $ 413 $ 795 Net cash from operating activities was $193 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. A portion of this increase is attributable to the release from restricted cash of $102 million related to the Mirant settlement (previously discussed in the Earnings Overview section above), and the 2009 receipt of the Federal income tax refund from the IRS of $138 million associated with the carry back of the net operating loss for tax reporting purposes that reflected, among other things, significant tax deductions related to accelerated depreciation, the pension plan contributions paid in 2009 (which were deductible for 2008) and the cumulative effect of adopting a new method of tax reporting for certain repairs. In addition, the 2009 net income included unrealized losses on derivatives of $59 million. PHI also experienced reduced cash requirements related to purchases of inventory (associated with lower gas and electric prices). Offsetting these increases were the pension plan contributions of $300 million made during 2009. Included in the 2008 net cash from operating activities was a non cash charge taken on the cross border energy lease investments (described in the Earnings Overview section above) and additional collateral requirements of the Competitive Energy business of $274 million. Net cash from operating activities was $382 million lower for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. In addition to a $34 million decrease in net income, the primary contributor was a $336 million increase in cash collateral requirements associated with Competitive Energy activities. The cash collateral requirements of the Competitive Energy business fluctuate significantly based on changes in energy market prices. 74 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Investing Activities Cash flows used by investing activities during 2009, 2008, and 2007 are summarized below. Cash (Use) Source 2009 2008 2007 (millions of dollars) Construction expenditures $ (864 ) $ (781 ) $ (623 ) Cash proceeds from sale of other assets 4 56 11 All other investing cash flows, net 11 30 Net cash used by investing activities $ (860 ) $ (714 ) $ (582 ) Net cash used by investing activities increased $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was due primarily to an $83 million increase in capital expenditures, of which $62 million was attributable to Conectiv Energy and $35 million was attributable to Power Delivery, partially offset by a decrease in Pepco Energy Services capital expenditures. The increase in Conectiv Energy capital expenditures was primarily due to the construction of new generating facilities. The increase in Power Delivery capital expenditures was primarily attributable to capital costs associated with the Mid Atlantic Power Pathway (MAPP) and Blueprint for the Future projects. The increase was also affected by the $52 million reduction in cash proceeds from the sale of other assets. Cash proceeds from the sale of assets in 2008 consisted primarily of $54 million received by DPL from the sale of its retail electric distribution assets and its wholesale electric transmission assets in Virginia. Net cash used by investing activities increased $132 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was due primarily to (i) $158 million increase in capital expenditures, of which $96 million was attributable to Conectiv Energy and $33 million was attributable to Power Delivery, and (ii) the receipt by Pepco in 2007 of the proceeds of the Mirant bankruptcy settlement, of which $15 million was designated as a reimbursement of certain investments in property, plant and equipment, offset by (iii) an increase of $45 million in cash proceeds from the sale of assets. The increase in Conectiv Energy capital expenditures was primarily due to the construction of new generating facilities. The increase in Power Delivery capital expenditures was primarily attributable to capital costs associated with new customer services, distribution reliability, and transmission. Proceeds from the sale of assets in 2007 consisted primarily of $9 million received from the sale by ACE of the B.L. England generating facility. 75 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Financing Activities Cash flows used by financing activities during 2009, 2008 and 2007 are summarized below. Cash (Use) Source 2009 2008 2007 (millions of dollars) Dividends paid on common and preferred stock $ (238 ) $ (222 ) $ (203 ) Common stock issued for the Shareholder Dividend Reinvestment Plan 31 29 28 Issuance of common stock (other than the Dividend Reinvestment Plan) 18 287 200 Redemption of preferred stock of subsidiaries (18 ) Issuances of long term debt 110 1,150 704 Reacquisition of long term debt (83 ) (590 ) (855 ) Issuances (repayments) of short term debt, net 65 26 (61 ) Cost of issuances (4 ) (30 ) (7 ) All other financing cash flows, net 17 (20 ) 5 Net cash (used by) provided by financing activities $ (84 ) $ 630 $ (207 ) Net cash from financing activities decreased $714 million for the year ended 2009, compared to the same period in 2008, principally due to the decrease in 2009 of issuances of long term debt and common stock, partially offset by the decrease in amounts spent to reacquire long term debt. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2008 was $837 million higher than in 2007, primarily due to an increase in issuances of common stock, long term debt and 2008 borrowings under the credit facilities, and a decrease in repayments of outstanding long term debt. Common Stock Dividends Common stock dividend payments were $238 million in 2009, $222 million in 2008, and $203 million in 2007. The increase in common dividends paid in 2009 was the result of additional shares outstanding, primarily from PHIs sale of 16.1 million shares of common stock in November 2008. The increase in common dividends paid in 2008 was the result of (i) additional shares outstanding, primarily from PHIs sale of 6.5 million shares of common stock in November 2007, and (ii) a quarterly dividend increase from 26 cents per share to 27 cents per share beginning in the first quarter of 2008. Changes in Outstanding Common Stock In November 2008, PHI sold 16.1 million shares of common stock in a registered offering at a price per share of $16.50, resulting in gross proceeds of $265 million. In November 2007, PHI sold 6.5 million shares of common stock in a registered offering at a price per share of $27.00, resulting in gross proceeds of $176 million. Under the Shareholder Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP), PHI issued 2.2 million shares of common stock in 2009, 1.3 million shares of common stock in 2008, and 1 million shares of common stock in 2007. 76 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Changes in Outstanding Preferred Stock Cash flows from the redemption of preferred stock in 2009, 2008 and 2007 are summarized in the chart below.

See Purchase and Resale of Tax Exempt Auction Rate Bonds below. Purchase and Resale of Tax Exempt Auction Rate Bonds The redemptions in 2008 shown above include the purchase at par by PHI subsidiaries of $276 million in aggregate principal amount of insured tax exempt auction rate bonds issued by municipal authorities for the benefit of the respective PHI subsidiaries. These purchases were made in response to disruption in the market for municipal auction rate securities that made it difficult for the remarketing agent to successfully remarket the bonds, at that time. These bond purchases consisted of the following: The purchase by Pepco of Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds issued by the Maryland Economic Development Corporation of an aggregate principal amount of $110 million (the Purchased Pepco Tax Exempt Bonds). 78 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS The purchase by DPL of Exempt Facilities Refunding Revenue Bonds issued by The Delaware Economic Development Authority in the aggregate principal amount of $112 million (the Purchased DPL Tax Exempt Bonds). The purchase by ACE of (i) Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds issued by Cape May County in the aggregate principal amount of $32 million and (ii) Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds issued by Salem County in the aggregate principal amount of $23 million (the Purchased ACE Tax Exempt Bonds). Upon the purchase of the tax exempt bonds, the obligations of the PHI subsidiaries with respect to these tax exempt bonds were considered to be extinguished for accounting purposes; however, each of the companies continued to hold the bonds, while monitoring the market and evaluating the options for reselling the bonds to the public at some time in the future. In 2009, PHI subsidiaries resold or redeemed the following tax exempt bonds that they purchased in 2008: Pepco resold the entire $110 million of the Purchased Pepco Tax Exempt Bonds, which is accounted for as long term debt. DPL redeemed $33 million of the Purchased DPL Tax Exempt Bonds. ACE redeemed $32 million of the Purchased ACE Tax Exempt Bonds. Changes in Short Term Debt During 2009, the market for commercial paper was less restrictive than it had been in 2008. As a result PHI and its utility subsidiaries were able to issue commercial paper and repay their bank loans and their loans outstanding under the $1.5 billion credit facility. As of December 31, 2009, PHI had a total of $384 million of commercial paper outstanding, as compared to no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2008 and $137 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2007. Due to the capital and credit market disruptions in 2008, the market for commercial paper was severely restricted. As a result, PHI and its subsidiaries were unable to issue commercial paper on a day to day basis either in amounts, or with maturities, that were typically required for cash management purposes. Given their restricted access to the commercial paper market and the general uncertainty in the credit markets, PHI and each of its subsidiaries borrowed under the $1.5 billion credit facility to create a cash reserve for future short term operating needs. As of December 31, 2008, PHI had a loan of $50 million outstanding and Pepco had a loan of $100 million outstanding under this facility. These loans were repaid in 2009. In 2008, both DPL and Pepco entered into short term bank loans. In March 2008, DPL obtained a $150 million unsecured bank loan that matured in July 2009. In May 2008, Pepco obtained a $25 million bank loan that matured in April 2009 and a $25 million bank loan that matured in September 2008. In 2008 and 2009, the following insured Variable Rate Demand Bonds (VRDBs) were tendered to The Bank of New York Mellon, as bond trustee, by the holders and purchased by The Bank of New York Mellon pursuant to standby bond purchase agreements for the respective series: $18.2 million of Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds 1997 Series A issued by Salem County for the benefit of ACE, and $4.4 million of Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds 1997 Series B issued by Salem County for the benefit of ACE. 79 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS In June 2009, the VRDBs were resold to the public. In connection with this remarketing, the financial guaranty insurance policies issued as credit support for the VRDBs were cancelled and replaced with letters of credit issued by The Bank of New York Mellon. The letters of credit will expire on June 23, 2010 unless extended. The expiration, cancellation, or termination of a letter of credit prior to the maturity of the related VRDBs will require DPL to repurchase the VRDBs. In November 2008, DPL repurchased $9 million of VRDBs due 2024. In 2007, with cash from operations, PHI redeemed $36 million in short term debt. Sale of Virginia Retail Electric Distribution and Wholesale Transmission Assets In January 2008, DPL completed (i) the sale of its retail electric distribution assets on the Eastern Shore of Virginia for a purchase price of approximately $49 million, and (ii) the sale of its wholesale electric transmission assets located on the Eastern Shore of Virginia for a purchase price of approximately $5 million. Sales of ACE Generating Facilities In 2007, ACE completed the sale of the B.L. England generating facility for a price of $9 million. In 2008, ACE received an additional $4 million in an arbitration settlement relating to the sale. For a discussion of the accounting treatment of the gains from these sales, see Note (7), Regulatory Assets and Regulatory Liabilities, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Proceeds from Settlement of Mirant Bankruptcy Claims In 2000, Pepco sold substantially all of its electricity generating assets to Mirant. As part of the sale, Pepco and Mirant entered into a back to back arrangement, whereby Mirant agreed to purchase from Pepco the 230 megawatts of electricity and capacity that Pepco was obligated to purchase annually through 2021 from Panda under the Panda PPA at the purchase price Pepco was obligated to pay to Panda. In 2003, Mirant commenced a voluntary bankruptcy proceeding in which it sought to reject certain obligations that it had undertaken in connection with the asset sale. As part of the settlement of Pepcos claims against Mirant arising from the bankruptcy, Pepco agreed not to contest the rejection by Mirant of its obligations under the back to back arrangement in exchange for the payment by Mirant of damages corresponding to the estimated amount by which the purchase price that Pepco was obligated to pay Panda for the energy and capacity exceeded the market price. In 2007, Pepco received as damages $414 million in net proceeds from the sale of shares of Mirant common stock issued to it by Mirant. In September 2008, Pepco transferred the Panda PPA to Sempra Energy Trading LLC (Sempra), along with a payment to Sempra, thereby terminating all further rights, obligations and liabilities of Pepco under the Panda PPA. In March 2009, the DCPSC issued an order approving Pepcos sharing proposal for the District of Columbia under which approximately $24 million was distributed to District of Columbia customers as a one time billing credit. As a result of this decision, Pepco recorded a pre tax gain of approximately $14 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2009. On July 2, 2009, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement among Pepco, the Maryland Office of Peoples Counsel and the MPSC staff under which Pepco distributed approximately $38 million to Maryland customers during the billing month of August 2009 through a one time billing credit. As a result of this decision, Pepco recorded a pre tax gain of approximately $26 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2009. The final resolution of this matter allowed for the release of $64 million previously accounted for as restricted cash and the extinguishment of the corresponding regulatory liability. 80 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Capital Requirements Capital Expenditures Pepco Holdings total capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2009 totaled $864 million, of which $622 million was incurred by Power Delivery, $200 million by Conectiv Energy, $12 million by Pepco Energy Services and $30 million by Corporate and Other. The Power Delivery expenditures were primarily related to capital costs associated with new customer services, distribution reliability, and transmission. The table below shows the projected capital expenditures for Power Delivery, Conectiv Energy, Pepco Energy Services and Corporate and Other for the five year period 2010 through 2014. Pepco Holdings expects to fund these expenditures through internally generated cash and external financing. For the Year 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Total (millions of dollars) Power Delivery Distribution $ 384 $ 469 $ 537 $ 562 $ 593 $ 2,545 Distribution Blueprint for the Future 115 128 59 8 92 402 Transmission 179 235 245 298 208 1,165 Transmission MAPP 24 246 317 297 246 1,130 Gas Delivery 20 20 20 21 20 101 Other 46 61 60 46 35 248 Sub Total 768 1,159 1,238 1,232 1,194 5,591 DOE Capital Reimbursement Awards (a) (30 ) (70 ) (26 ) (4 ) (130 ) Total for Power Delivery Business 738 1,089 1,212 1,228 1,194 5,461 Conectiv Energy 174 41 14 11 18 258 Pepco Energy Services 13 8 14 1 1 37 Corporate and Other 3 3 3 3 3 15 Total PHI $ 928 $ 1,141 $ 1,243 $ 1,243 $ 1,216 $ 5,771 (a) Amounts are presented on a gross basis on the assumption that the awards are not subject to federal or state tax. In 2009, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced awards under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 of: $105 million and $44 million in Pepcos Maryland and the District of Columbia service territories respectively for the implementation of an advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) system, direct load control, distribution automation, and communications infrastructure. $19 million to ACE for the implementation of direct load control, distribution automation, and communications infrastructure in its New Jersey service territory. PHI is currently in the process of finalizing certain terms and conditions of the awards with the DOE. Of the $168 million, $130 million, as shown in the table above, will offset Blueprint for the Future and other capital expenditures that the PHI subsidiaries are projected to incur. The remaining $38 million will be used to help offset ongoing expenses associated with direct load control and other Power Delivery programs. 81 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Distribution, Transmission and Gas Delivery The projected capital expenditures listed in the table for distribution (other than Blueprint for the Future), transmission (other than the MAPP project) and gas delivery are primarily for facility replacements and upgrades to accommodate customer growth and reliability. Blueprint for the Future For a discussion of the Blueprint for the Future initiative, see Item 1, Business Description of Business Blueprint for the Future of this Form 10 K. MAPP Project The total cost of the MAPP project is currently estimated to be $1.2 billion. For a discussion of the MAPP project, see Item 1, Business Description of Business MAPP Project of this Form 10 K. MAPP/DOE Loan Program PHI has applied for a $684 million loan guarantee from the DOE for a substantial portion of the MAPP project, primarily the Calvert Cliffs to Indian River segment. The loan guarantee is available under a loan guarantee program for projects that employ innovative energy efficiency, renewable energy and advanced transmission and distribution technologies. If granted, PHI believes that the guarantee would allow PHI to obtain financing at a lower cost than it would otherwise be able to obtain in the capital markets. Whether PHIs application will be granted and, if so, the amount of debt guaranteed is subject to the discretion of the DOE and the negotiation of terms that will satisfy the conditions of the terms of the guarantee program. Delta Project Conectiv Energy is constructing a 545 megawatt natural gas and oil fired combined cycle electricity generation plant in Peach Bottom Township, Pennsylvania (Delta Project). The total construction expenditures including capitalized interest for the Delta Project are expected to be $470 million, of which $178 million was expended in 2009, $62 million in 2008 and $63 million in 2007. Projected expenditures of $147 million in 2010 and $20 million in 2011 are included in Conectiv Energys projected capital expenditures shown in the table above. The plant is expected to become operational during the second quarter of 2011. Cumberland Project In 2009, Conectiv Energy completed construction of a new 100 megawatt combustion turbine power plant in Millville, New Jersey. The total construction expenditure including capitalized interest for this project was $75 million. The plant became operational during the second quarter of 2009. Dividends Pepco Holdings annual dividend rate on its common stock is determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration, among other factors, current and possible future developments that may affect PHIs income and cash flows. In 2009, PHIs Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of 27 cents per share of common stock payable on March 31, 2009, June 30, 2009, September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2009. 82 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS On January 28, 2010, the Board of Directors declared a dividend on common stock of 27 cents per share payable March 31, 2010, to shareholders of record on March 10, 2010. PHI, on a stand alone basis, generates no operating income of its own. Accordingly, its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders depends on dividends received from its subsidiaries. In addition to their future financial performance, the ability of PHIs direct and indirect subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to limits imposed by: (i) state corporate laws, which impose limitations on the funds that can be used to pay dividends and, in the case of ACE, the regulatory requirement that it obtain the prior approval of the NJBPU before dividends can be paid if its equity as a percent of its total capitalization, excluding securitization debt, falls below 30%; (ii) the prior rights of holders of existing and future preferred stock, mortgage bonds and other long term debt issued by the subsidiaries, and any other restrictions imposed in connection with the incurrence of liabilities; and (iii) certain provisions of ACEs charter that impose restrictions on payment of common stock dividends for the benefit of preferred stockholders. Pepco and DPL have no shares of preferred stock outstanding. Currently, the capitalization ratio limitation to which ACE is subject and the restriction in the ACE charter do not limit ACEs ability to pay common stock dividends. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Summary information about Pepco Holdings consolidated contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2009, is as follows: Contractual Maturity Obligation Total Lessthan 1Year 1 3Years 3 5Years After 5Years (millions of dollars) Variable Rate Demand Bonds $ 146 $ 146 $ $ $ Commercial paper 384 384 Long term debt (a) 5,385 533 857 892 3,103 Long term project funding 20 3 4 4 9 Interest payments on debt 3,827 308 581 453 2,485 Capital leases 152 15 30 30 77 Liabilities and accrued interest related to effectively settled and uncertain tax positions 39 39 Operating leases 561 79 83 45 354 Estimated pension plan contributions 100 100 Non derivative fuel and purchase power contracts (b) 4,943 1,112 1,109 592 2,130 Total $ 15,557 $ 2,719 $ 2,664 $ 2,016 $ 8,158 (a) Includes transition bonds issued by Atlantic City Electric Transition Funding, LLC. (b) Excludes contracts for the purchase of electricity to satisfy Default Electricity Supply load service obligations which have neither a fixed commitment amount nor a minimum purchase amount. In addition, costs are recoverable from customers. 83 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Third Party Guarantees, Indemnifications and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements For a discussion of PHIs third party guarantees, indemnifications, obligations and off balance sheet arrangements, see Note (17), Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The following table provides detail on changes in the net asset or liability position of the Competitive Energy business (consisting of the activities of the Conectiv Energy and Pepco Energy Services segments) with respect to energy commodity contracts for the year ended December 31, 2009. The balances reflected in the table are stated gross, pre tax and before the netting of collateral as required by FASB guidance on the offsetting of balance sheet accounts (ASC 210 20). EnergyCommodityActivities (a) (millions of dollars) Total Fair Value of Energy Contract Net Liabilities at December 31, 2008 $ (314 ) Current period unrealized losses (13 ) Effective portion of changes in fair value recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (340 ) Cash flow hedge ineffectiveness recorded in income (2 ) Recognition of realized gains (losses) on settlement of contracts 341 Total Fair Value of Energy Contract Net Liabilities at December 31, 2009 $ (328 ) Total Detail of Fair Value of Energy Contract Net Liabilities at December 31, 2009 (see above) Derivative assets (current assets) $ 26 Derivative assets (non current assets) 49 Total Fair Value of Energy Contract Assets 75 Derivative liabilities (current liabilities) (328 ) Derivative liabilities (non current liabilities) (75 ) Total Fair Value of Energy Contract Liabilities (403 ) Total Fair Value of Energy Contract Net Liabilities $ (328 ) Notes: (a) Includes all hedging and trading activities recorded at fair value through Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) or on the Statements of Income, as required. The $328 million net liability on energy contracts at December 31, 2009 was primarily attributable to losses on power swaps and natural gas futures and swaps designated as hedges of future energy purchases or production under FASB guidance on derivatives and hedging (ASC 815). Prices of electricity and natural gas declined during the year, which resulted in unrealized losses on the energy contracts of the Competitive Energy business. Competitive Energy recorded unrealized losses of $340 million on energy contracts in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss as these energy contracts were effective hedges under the guidance. When these energy contracts settle, the related realized gains or losses are expected to be largely offset by the realized loss or gain on future energy purchases or production that will be used to settle the sales obligations of the Competitive Energy business with its customers. 84 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS PHI uses its best estimates to determine the fair value of the commodity and derivative contracts that are held and sold by its Competitive Energy business. The fair values in each category presented below reflect forward prices and volatility factors as of December 31, 2009 and are subject to change as a result of changes in these factors: Fair Value of Contracts at December 31, 2009Maturities Source of Fair Value 2010 2011 2012 2013 andBeyond TotalFairValue (millions of dollars) Energy Commodity Activities, net (a) Actively Quoted (i.e., exchange traded) prices $ (98 ) $ (13 ) $ (9 ) $ (3 ) $ (123 ) Prices provided by other external sources (b) (158 ) (28 ) (41 ) (4 ) (231 ) Modeled (c) 4 6 9 7 26 Total $ (252 ) $ (35 ) $ (41 ) $ $ (328 ) Notes: (a) Includes all hedge activity and trading activities recorded at fair value through AOCL or on the Statements of Income, as required. (b) Prices provided by other external sources reflect information obtained from over the counter brokers, industry services, or multiple party on line platforms that are readily observable in the market. (c) Modeled values include significant inputs, usually representing more than 10% of the valuation, not readily observable in the market. The modeled valuation above represents the fair valuation of certain long dated power transactions based on limited observable broker prices extrapolated for periods beyond two years into the future. Contractual Arrangements with Credit Rating Triggers or Margining Rights Under certain contractual arrangements entered into by PHIs subsidiaries in connection with the Competitive Energy business and other transactions, the subsidiary may be required to provide cash collateral or letters of credit as security for its contractual obligations if the credit ratings of the subsidiary are downgraded. In the event of a downgrade, the amount required to be posted would depend on the amount of the underlying contractual obligation existing at the time of the downgrade. Based on contractual provisions in effect at December 31, 2009, a one level downgrade in the unsecured debt credit ratings of PHI and each of its rated subsidiaries, which would decrease PHIs rating to below investment grade, would increase the collateral obligation of PHI and its subsidiaries by up to $460 million, $246 million of which is the net settlement amount attributable to derivatives, normal purchase and normal sale contracts, collateral, and other contracts under master netting agreements as described in Note (15), Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The remaining $214 million is attributable primarily to energy services contracts and accounts payable to independent system operators and distribution companies under full requirements contracts entered into by Pepco Energy Services. PHI believes that it and its utility subsidiaries currently have sufficient liquidity under the primary credit facilities and otherwise to fund these financial obligations were they to be incurred. Many of the contractual arrangements entered into by PHIs subsidiaries in connection with Competitive Energy and Default Electricity Supply activities include margining rights pursuant to which the PHI subsidiary or a counterparty may request collateral if the market value of the contractual obligations reaches levels in excess of the credit thresholds established in the applicable arrangements. Pursuant to these margining rights, the affected PHI subsidiary may receive, or be required to post, collateral due to energy price movements. As of December 31, 2009, Pepco Holdings subsidiaries engaged in Competitive Energy activities and Default Electricity Supply activities provided net cash collateral in the amount of $364 million in connection with these activities. 85 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Environmental Remediation Obligations PHIs accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2009 include approximately $12 million, of which approximately $6 million is expected to be incurred in 2010, for potential environmental cleanup and other costs related to sites at which an operating subsidiary is a potentially responsible party, is alleged to be a third party contributor, or has made a decision to clean up contamination on its own property. For information regarding projected expenditures for environmental control facilities, see Item 1 Business Environmental Matters, of this Form 10 K. The most significant environmental remediation obligations as of December 31, 2009, were: Approximately $2 million, of which approximately $1 million is expected to be incurred in 2010, payable by DPL in accordance with a 2001 consent agreement reached with the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, for remediation, site restoration, natural resource damage compensatory projects and other costs associated with environmental contamination that resulted from an oil release at the Indian River power plant, which was sold in June 2001. Approximately $4 million in environmental remediation costs, of which approximately $2 million is expected to be incurred in 2010, payable by Conectiv Energy associated with the Deepwater generating facility. Approximately $2 million, constituting Pepcos liability for a remedy at the Metal Bank/Cottman Avenue site. Approximately $2 million, nearly 90% of which is expected to be incurred in 2010, payable by DPL in connection with the Wilmington Coal Gas South site located in Wilmington, Delaware, to remediate residual material from the historical operation of a manufactured gas plant. Less than $1 million, of which approximately 10% is expected to be incurred in 2010, payable by Pepco for long term monitoring associated with a pipeline oil release that occurred in 2000. Sources of Capital Pepco Holdings sources to meet its long term funding needs, such as capital expenditures, dividends, and new investments, and its short term funding needs, such as working capital and the temporary funding of long term funding needs, include internally generated funds, securities issuances and bank financing under new or existing facilities. PHIs ability to generate funds from its operations and to access capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties. Volatile and deteriorating financial market conditions, diminished liquidity and tightening credit may affect access to certain of PHIs potential funding sources. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10 K, for additional discussion of important factors that may impact these sources of capital. Cash flow from Operations Cash flow generated by regulated utility subsidiaries in the Power Delivery business is the primary source of PHIs cash flow from operations. Additional cash flows are generated by PHIs non regulated subsidiaries and from the sale of non core assets. Short Term Funding Sources Pepco Holdings and its regulated utility subsidiaries have traditionally used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs, such as commercial paper, short term notes and bank lines of credit. Proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs but may also be used to fund temporarily long term capital requirements. 86 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Pepco Holdings maintains an ongoing commercial paper program of up to $875 million. Pepco and DPL have ongoing commercial paper programs of up to $500 million, and ACE up to $250 million. The commercial paper can be issued with maturities of up to 270 days. Long Term Funding Sources The sources of long term funding for PHI and its subsidiaries are the issuance of debt and equity securities and borrowing under long term credit agreements. Proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements, such as capital expenditures and new investments, and to repay or refinance existing indebtedness. Regulatory Restrictions on Financing Activities The issuance of debt securities by PHIs principal subsidiaries requires approval of either FERC or one or more state public utility commissions. Neither FERC approval nor state public utility commission approval is required as a condition to the issuance of securities by PHI. State Financing Authority Pepcos long term financing activities (including the issuance of securities and the incurrence of debt) are subject to authorization by the DCPSC and MPSC. DPLs long term financing activities are subject to authorization by MPSC and the DPSC. ACEs long term and short term (consisting of debt instruments with a maturity of one year or less) financing activities are subject to authorization by the NJBPU. Each utility, through periodic filings with the state public service commission(s) having jurisdiction over its financing activities, typically seeks to maintain standing authority sufficient to cover its projected financing needs over a multi year period. FERC Financing Authority Under the Federal Power Act (FPA), FERC has jurisdiction over the issuance of long term and short term securities of public utilities, but only if the issuance is not regulated by the state public utility commission in which the public utility is organized and operating. Under these provisions, FERC has jurisdiction over the issuance of short term debt by Pepco and DPL. Pepco and DPL have obtained FERC authority for the issuance of short term debt. Because Conectiv Energy and Pepco Energy Services also qualify as public utilities under the FPA and are not regulated by a state utility commission, FERC also has jurisdiction over the issuance of securities by those companies. Conectiv Energy and Pepco Energy Services have obtained the requisite FERC financing authority in their respective market based rate orders. Money Pool Pepco Holdings operates a system money pool under a blanket authorization adopted by FERC. The money pool is a cash management mechanism used by Pepco Holdings to manage the short term investment and borrowing requirements of its subsidiaries that participate in the money pool. Pepco Holdings may invest in but not borrow from the money pool. Eligible subsidiaries with surplus cash may deposit those funds in the money pool. Deposits in the money pool are guaranteed by Pepco Holdings. Eligible subsidiaries with cash requirements may borrow from the money pool. Borrowings from the money pool are unsecured. Depositors in the money pool receive, and borrowers from the money pool pay, an interest rate based primarily on Pepco Holdings short term borrowing rate. Pepco Holdings deposits funds in the money pool to the extent that the pool has insufficient funds to meet the borrowing needs of its participants, which may require Pepco Holdings to borrow funds for deposit from external sources. 87 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Regulatory And Other Matters For a discussion of material pending regulatory and legal proceedings, and certain other commitments and contingencies, see Note (17), Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies General Pepco Holdings has identified the following accounting policies, including certain estimates, that as a result of the judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved, could result in material changes in its financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions. Pepco Holdings has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Goodwill Impairment Evaluation PHI believes that the estimates involved in its goodwill impairment evaluation process represent Critical Accounting Estimates because they are subjective and susceptible to change from period to period as management makes assumptions and judgments, and the impact of a change in assumptions and estimates could be material to financial results. Substantially all of PHIs goodwill was generated by Pepcos acquisition of Conectiv in 2002 and is allocated to the Power Delivery reporting unit for purposes of assessing impairment under FASB guidance on goodwill and other intangibles (ASC 350). Management has identified Power Delivery as a single reporting unit based on the aggregation of components which have similar economic characteristics, similar products and services and operate in a similar regulatory environment. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. Management uses its best judgment to make reasonable projections of future cash flows for Power Delivery when estimating the reporting units fair value. In addition, PHI selects a discount rate for the associated risk with those estimated cash flows. These judgments are inherently uncertain, and actual results could vary from those used in PHIs estimates. The impact of such variations could significantly alter the results of a goodwill impairment test, which could materially impact the estimated fair value of Power Delivery and potentially the amount of any impairment recorded in the financial statements. PHI has historically tested its goodwill for impairment annually as of July 1 from 2002 to 2009, and on an interim basis whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. After completion of the July 1, 2009 annual test, PHI changed the date of its annual test to November 1, and accordingly PHI has performed its next annual impairment test as of November 1, 2009. Factors that may result in an interim impairment test include, but are not limited to: a change in identified reporting units; an adverse change in business conditions; a protracted decline in stock price causing market capitalization to fall below book value; an adverse regulatory action; or impairment of long lived assets in the reporting unit. PHIs November 1, 2009 annual impairment test indicated that its goodwill was not impaired. See Note (6), Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements of Pepco Holdings, set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. PHI performed an interim test of goodwill for impairment as of March 31, 2009 which updated an interim test performed as of December 31, 2008 as its market capitalization was below its book value at both points in time and its market capitalization relative to book value had declined significantly from the December 31, 2008 market capitalization. PHI concluded that its goodwill was not impaired at either July 1, 2009, March 31, 2009, or December 31, 2008. Although PHIs market capitalization remained below book value as of December 31, 2009, PHI did not perform an interim goodwill impairment test because its market capitalization relative to book value improved compared to earlier periods and there were no other indicators of potential impairment. 88 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS In order to estimate the fair value of the Power Delivery reporting unit, PHI uses two discounted cash flow models. The models differ in the method used to calculate the terminal value of the reporting unit. One model estimates terminal value based on a constant annual cash flow growth rate that is consistent with Power Deliverys long term view of the business, and the other model estimates terminal value based on a multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) that management believes is consistent with EBITDA multiples for comparable utilities. The models use a cost of capital appropriate for a regulated utility as the discount rate for the estimated cash flows associated with the reporting unit. PHI has consistently used this valuation methodology to estimate the fair value of Power Delivery. The estimation of fair value is dependent on a number of factors that are sourced from the Power Delivery reporting units business forecast, including but not limited to interest rates, growth assumptions, returns on rate base, operating and capital expenditure requirements, and other factors, changes in which could materially impact the results of impairment testing. Assumptions and methodologies used in the models were consistent with historical experience. A hypothetical 10 percent decrease in fair value of the Power Delivery reporting unit at November 1, 2009 would not have resulted in the Power Delivery reporting unit failing the first step of the impairment test, as defined in the guidance, as the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would have been above its carrying value Sensitive, interrelated and uncertain variables that could decrease the estimated fair value of the Power Delivery reporting unit include utility sector market performance, sustained adverse business conditions, change in forecasted revenues, higher operating and capital expenditure requirements, a significant increase in the cost of capital, and other factors. Long Lived Assets Impairment Evaluation Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in its long lived asset impairment evaluation process represent Critical Accounting Estimates because (i) they are highly susceptible to change from period to period because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about undiscounted and discounted future cash flows and fair values, which are inherently uncertain, (ii) actual results could vary from those used in Pepco Holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material, and (iii) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on Pepco Holdings assets as well as the net loss related to an impairment charge could be material. The primary assets subject to a long lived asset impairment evaluation are property, plant, and equipment. The FASB guidance on the accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets (ASC 360), requires that certain long lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, such as (1) a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset or asset group, (2) a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition, (3) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, (4) an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset or asset group, (5) a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group, and (6) a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. An impairment loss may only be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. The asset is deemed not to be recoverable when its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. In order to estimate an assets future cash flows, Pepco Holdings considers historical cash flows. Pepco Holdings uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel costs, legislative initiatives, and operating costs. If necessary, the process of determining fair value is done consistent with the process described in assessing the fair value of goodwill discussed above. 89 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Accounting for Derivatives Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in accounting for its derivative instruments represent Critical Accounting Estimates because management exercises judgment in the following areas, any of which could have a material impact on its financial statements: (i) the application of the definition of a derivative to contracts to identify derivatives, (ii) the election of the normal purchases and normal sales exception from derivative accounting, (iii) the application of cash flow hedge accounting (iv) the estimation of fair value used in the measurement of derivatives and hedged items, which are highly susceptible to changes in value over time due to market trends or, in certain circumstances, significant uncertainties in modeling techniques used to measure fair value that could result in actual results being materially different from Pepco Holdings estimates. See Note (2), Significant Accounting Policies Accounting for Derivatives and Note (15), Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for information on PHIs accounting for derivatives. Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments primarily to manage risk associated with commodity prices. The definition of a derivative in the FASB guidance results in management having to exercise judgment, such as whether there is a notional amount or net settlement provision in contracts. Management assesses a number of factors before determining whether it can designate derivatives for the normal purchase or normal sale exception from derivative accounting, including whether it is probable that the contracts will physically settle with delivery of the underlying commodity. The application of cash flow hedge accounting often requires judgment in the prospective and retrospective assessment and measurement of hedge effectiveness as well as whether it is probable that the forecasted transaction will occur. The fair value of derivatives is determined using quoted exchange prices where available. For instruments that are not traded on an exchange, external broker quotes are used to determine fair value. Internal models use market information when external broker quotes are not available for some custom and complex instruments. For certain long dated instruments, broker or exchange data is extrapolated for future periods where limited market information is available. Models are also used to estimate volumes for certain transactions. The same valuation methods are used for risk management purposes to determine the value of non derivative, commodity exposure. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in reporting the costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefits represent Critical Accounting Estimates because (i) they are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of assumptions which are subjective in nature, (ii) they are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience, and (iii) changes in assumptions could impact Pepco Holdings expected future cash funding requirements for the plans and would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations, and the reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost on the income statement. Assumptions about the future, including the expected return on plan assets, discount rate applied to benefit obligations, the anticipated rate of increase in health care costs and participant compensation have a significant impact on employee benefit costs. In terms of quantifying the anticipated impact of a change in the critical assumptions while holding all other assumptions constant, Pepco Holdings estimates that a .25% decrease in the discount rate used to value the benefit obligations could result in a $5 million increase in net periodic benefit cost. Additionally, Pepco Holdings estimates that a .25% reduction in the expected return on plan assets could result in a $4 million increase in net periodic benefit cost. A 1.0% increase in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate could result in a $2 million increase net periodic benefit cost. In addition to its impact on cost, a .25% decrease in the discount rate would increase PHIs projected pension benefit obligation by $46 million and would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit 90 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS obligation by $16 million at December 31, 2009. Pepco Holdings management consults with its actuaries and investment consultants when selecting its plan assumptions, and benchmarks its critical assumptions against other corporate plans. The impact of changes in assumptions and the difference between actual and expected or estimated results on pension and postretirement obligations is generally recognized over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans rather than immediately recognized in the statements of income. For additional discussion, see Note (10), Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Accounting for Regulated Activities FASB guidance on the accounting for regulated activities applies to the Power Delivery businesses of Pepco, DPL, and ACE and can result in the deferral of costs or revenue that would otherwise be recognized by non regulated entities. PHI defers the recognition of costs and records regulatory assets when it is probable those costs will be recovered in future rates charged to its customers. PHI defers the recognition of revenues and records regulatory liabilities when it is probable that it will refund payments received from customers in the future or that it will incur future costs related to the payments currently received from customers. Pepco Holdings believes that the judgments involved in accounting for its regulated activities represent Critical Accounting Estimates because (i) management must interpret laws and regulatory commission orders to assess the probability of the recovery of costs from customers or the return of revenues to customers when determining whether those costs or revenues should be deferred, (ii) decisions made by regulatory commissions or legislative changes at a later date could vary from earlier interpretations made by management and the impact of such variations could be material, and (iii) writing off a regulatory asset because deferred costs are no longer probable of recovery in future rates charged to customers could have a material negative impact on Pepco Holdings assets and earnings. Managements most significant judgment is whether to defer costs or revenues when there is not a current regulatory order specific to the item being considered for deferral. In those cases, management considers relevant historical precedents of the regulatory commissions, the results of recent rate orders, and any new information from its more current interactions with the regulatory commissions on that item. Management regularly reviews its regulatory assets and liabilities to determine whether adjustments to its previous conclusions are necessary based on the current regulatory and legislative environment as well as recent rate orders. Unbilled Revenue Unbilled revenue represents an estimate of revenue earned from services rendered by Pepco Holdings utility operations that have not yet been billed. Pepco Holdings utility operations calculate unbilled revenue using an output based methodology. The calculation is based on the supply of electricity or gas distributed to customers but not yet billed and adjusted for estimated line loss. Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in its unbilled revenue process represent Critical Accounting Estimates because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about input factors to the unbilled revenue calculation. Specifically, the determination of estimated line loss is inherently uncertain. Estimated line loss is defined as the estimates of electricity and gas expected to be lost in the process of its transmission and distribution to customers. A change in estimated line loss can change the output available for sale which is a factor in the unbilled revenue calculation. Certain factors can influence the estimated line loss such as seasonality and a change in customer mix. These factors may vary between companies due to geography and density of service territory and the impact of changes in these factors could be material. The risk of misstatement in the unbilled revenue calculation is mitigated through corroboration of the resultant unbilled revenue with historical information and other available metrics. 91 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Accounting for Income Taxes Pepco Holdings exercises significant judgment about the outcome of income tax matters in its application of the FASB guidance on accounting for income taxes and believes it represents a Critical Accounting Estimate because: (1) it records a current tax liability for estimated current tax expense on its federal and state tax returns; (2) it records deferred tax assets for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return determination of pre tax income and the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are more likely than not going to result in tax deductions in future years; (3) it determines whether a valuation allowance is needed against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion of the future tax deductions will not be realized; (4) it records deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return determination of pre tax income and the carrying amount of assets and liabilities if it is more likely than not that they are expected to result in tax payments in future years; (5) the measurement of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities requires it to estimate future effective tax rates and future taxable income on its federal and state tax returns; (6) it must consider the effect of newly enacted tax law on its estimated effective tax rate and in measuring deferred tax balances; (7) it asserts that tax positions in its tax returns or expected to be taken in its tax returns are more likely than not to be sustained assuming that the tax positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements and that the benefit recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Assumptions, judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard has been met when developing the provision for current and deferred income taxes and the associated current and deferred tax assets and liabilities. Pepco Holdings assumptions, judgments and estimates take into account current tax laws and regulations, interpretation of current tax laws and regulations, the impact of newly enacted tax laws and regulations, developments in case law, settlements of tax positions, and the possible outcomes of current and future investigations conducted by tax authorities. Pepco Holdings has established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. Although Pepco Holdings believes that these assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws and regulations or its interpretation of tax laws and regulations as well as the resolutions of the current and any future investigations or legal proceedings could significantly impact the financial results from applying the accounting for income taxes in the consolidated financial statements. Pepco Holdings reviews its application of the more likely than not standard quarterly. Pepco Holdings also evaluates quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or successfully implement tax planning strategies may affect the realization of deferred tax assets and the amount of any associated valuation allowance. The forecast of future taxable income is dependent on a number of factors that can change over time, including growth assumptions, business conditions, returns on rate base, operating and capital expenditures, cost of capital, tax laws and regulations, the legal structure of entities and other factors, which could materially impact the realizability of deferred tax assets and the associated financial results in the consolidated financial statements.

General Overview Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco) is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity in the District of Columbia and major portions of Montgomery County and Prince Georges County in suburban Maryland. Pepco also provides Default Electricity Supply, which is the supply of electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territories who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive supplier. Default Electricity Supply is known as Standard Offer Service in both the District of Columbia and Maryland. Pepcos service territory covers approximately 640 square miles and has a population of approximately 2.1 million. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 57% of delivered electricity sales were to Maryland customers and approximately 43% were to the District of Columbia customers. Effective June 2007, the Maryland Public Service Commission (MPSC) approved a bill stabilization adjustment mechanism (BSA) for retail customers. The District of Columbia Public Service Commission (DCPSC) also approved a BSA for retail customers, effective in November 2009. For customers to whom the BSA applies, Pepco recognizes distribution revenue based on the approved distribution charge per customer. From a revenue recognition standpoint, this has the effect of decoupling distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period. As a consequence, the only factors that will cause distribution revenue in Maryland and the District of Columbia to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer. For customers to whom the BSA applies, changes in customer usage (such as due to weather conditions, energy prices, energy efficiency programs or other reasons) from period to period have no impact on reported distribution revenue. As a result of the BSA in Maryland and the District of Columbia, a Revenue Decoupling Adjustment is recorded representing either (a) a positive adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from Maryland and District of Columbia retail distribution sales falls short of the revenue that Pepco is entitled to earn based on the distribution charge per customer approved in the 2007 Maryland Rate Order and the DCPSC order approving a BSA for Pepco in the District of Columbia effective November 1, 2009 or (b) a negative adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from such distribution sales exceeds the revenue that Pepco is entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer. Pepco is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI or Pepco Holdings). Because PHI is a public utility holding company subject to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005), the relationship between PHI and Pepco and certain activities of Pepco are subject to the regulatory oversight of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under PUHCA 2005. 95 Table of Contents PEPCO Results Of Operations The following results of operations discussion compares the year ended December 31, 2009 to the year ended December 31, 2008. All amounts in the tables (except sales and customers) are in millions of dollars. Operating Revenue 2009 2008 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 947 $ 978 $ (31 ) Default Electricity Supply Revenue 1,251 1,309 (58 ) Other Electric Revenue 33 35 (2 ) Total Operating Revenue $ 2,231 $ 2,322 $ (91 ) The table above shows the amount of Operating Revenue earned that is subject to price regulation (Regulated Transmission & Distribution (T&D) Electric Revenue and Default Electricity Supply Revenue) and that which is not subject to price regulation (Other Electric Revenue). Regulated T&D Electric Revenue includes revenue from the delivery of electricity, including the delivery of Default Electricity Supply, to Pepcos customers within its service territory at regulated rates. Regulated T&D Electric Revenue also includes transmission service revenue that Pepco receives as a transmission owner from PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM). Default Electricity Supply Revenue is the revenue received from the supply of electricity by Pepco at regulated rates to retail customers who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive supplier, and which is also known as Standard Offer Service (SOS). The costs related to Default Electricity Supply are included in Purchased Energy. Other Electric Revenue includes work and services performed on behalf of customers, including other utilities, which is generally not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of pole attachments, late payment fees, and collection fees. Regulated T&D Electric Regulated T&D Electric Revenue 2009 2008 Change Residential $ 271 $ 267 $ 4 Commercial and industrial 571 552 19 Other 105 159 (54 ) Total Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 947 $ 978 $ (31 ) Other Regulated T&D Electric Revenue consists primarily of: (i) transmission service revenue and (ii) revenue from the resale in the PJM Regional Transmission Organization (PJM RTO) market of energy and capacity purchased under a power purchase agreement between Panda Brandywine, L.P. (Panda) and Pepco (the Panda PPA) prior to the transfer of the Panda PPA to an unaffiliated third party in September 2008.

The decrease was partially offset by: An increase of $15 million due to higher pass through revenue (which is substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Other Taxes) primarily the result of rate increases in utility taxes that are collected on behalf of the taxing jurisdictions An increase of $4 million due to a distribution rate increase in the District of Columbia that became effective in February 2008. An increase of $4 million as a result of the BSA in the District of Columbia that become effective in November 2009 (includes a positive $2 million Revenue Decoupling Adjustment).

A decrease of $18 million due to lower sales as a result of milder weather primarily during the 2009 summer months as compared to 2008. 97 Table of Contents PEPCO The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $9 million as the result of higher Default Electricity Supply rates. The following table shows the percentages of Pepcos total distribution sales by jurisdiction that are derived from customers receiving Default Electricity Supply from Pepco. Amounts are for the year ended December 31. 2009 2008 Sales to District of Columbia customers 31 % 33 % Sales to Maryland customers 49 % 50 % Operating Expenses Purchased Energy Purchased Energy consists of the cost of electricity purchased by Pepco to fulfill its Default Electricity Supply obligation and, as such, is recoverable from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders. Purchased Energy decreased by $112 million to $1,223 million in 2009 from $1,335 million in 2008 primarily due to: A decrease of $53 million (which is matched by a corresponding decrease in Other Regulated T&D Electric Revenue) due to the transfer of the Panda PPA. A decrease of $48 million primarily due to commercial customer migration to competitive suppliers. A decrease of $40 million due to lower average electricity costs under Default Electricity Supply contracts. A decrease of $17 million due to lower electricity sales as a result of milder weather primarily during the 2009 summer months as compared to 2008. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $47 million due to a higher rate of recovery of electricity supply costs resulting in a decrease in the Default Electricity Supply deferral balance. Other Operation and Maintenance Other Operation and Maintenance increased by $26 million to $328 million in 2009 from $302 million in 2008. The increase was primarily due to: An increase of $14 million in employee related costs, primarily due to higher pension and other postretirement benefit expenses. An increase of $6 million primarily due to higher preventative and corrective maintenance costs. An increase of $5 million in regulatory expenses primarily incurred in connection with the District of Columbia distribution rate case. An increase of $4 million due to higher non deferrable bad debt expenses. 98 Table of Contents PEPCO During 2008, Pepco recorded adjustments to correct errors in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses for prior periods dating back to February 2005 during which (i) customer late payment fees were incorrectly recognized and (ii) stock based compensation expense related to certain restricted stock awards granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan was understated. These adjustments resulted in a total increase in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 of $6 million. These adjustments were not considered material either individually or in the aggregate. Other Taxes Other Taxes increased by $14 million to $302 million in 2009 from $288 million in 2008. The increase (which is substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue) was primarily due to increased pass throughs resulting from rate increases in utility taxes imposed by the taxing jurisdictions. Effect of Settlement of Mirant Bankruptcy Claims In September 2008, Pepco transferred the Panda PPA to an unaffiliated third party. In March 2009, the District of Columbia Public Service Commission approved an allocation between Pepco and its District of Columbia customers of the District of Columbia portion of the Mirant Corporation (Mirant) bankruptcy settlement proceeds remaining after the transfer of the Panda PPA. As a result, Pepco recorded a pre tax gain of $14 million reflecting the District of Columbia proceeds retained by Pepco. In July 2009, MPSC approved an allocation between Pepco and its Maryland customers of the Maryland portion of the Mirant bankruptcy settlement proceeds remaining after the transfer of the Panda PPA. As a result, Pepco recorded a pre tax gain of $26 million reflecting the Maryland proceeds retained by Pepco. Other Income (Expenses) Other Expenses (which are net of Other Income) increased by $15 million to a net expense of $91 million in 2009 from a net expense of $76 million in 2008. The increase was primarily due to a $20 million increase in interest expense on long term debt as the result of a higher amount of outstanding debt. Income Tax Expense Pepcos effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were 41.8% and 35.6%, respectively. The increase in the rate primarily resulted from the change in estimates and interest related to uncertain tax positions which was the result of the reduction in previously accrued interest and estimates resulting from the tentative settlement of the mixed service cost issue. Also contributing to the increase in the rate was the 2008 benefit recorded for interest received on the state income tax refund. Capital Requirements Sources of Capital Pepco has a range of capital sources available, in addition to internally generated funds, to meet its long term and short term funding needs. The sources of long term funding include the issuance of mortgage bonds and other debt securities and bank financings, as well as the ability to issue preferred stock. Proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements, such as capital expenditures, and to repay or refinance existing indebtedness. Pepco traditionally has used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs, including commercial paper, short term notes, bank lines of credit and borrowings under the PHI money pool. Proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs, but may also be used to fund temporary long term capital requirements. Pepcos ability to generate funds from its operations and to access the capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties. Volatile and deteriorating financial market conditions, 99 Table of Contents PEPCO diminished liquidity and tightening credit may affect access to certain of Pepcos potential funding sources. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10 K, for additional discussion of important factors that may have an effect on Pepcos sources of capital. Mortgage Bonds, Senior Notes, Medium Term Notes, and Tax Exempt Bonds Pepco has a Mortgage and Deed of Trust (the Mortgage) under which it issues First Mortgage Bonds. First Mortgage Bonds issued under the Mortgage are secured by a lien on substantially all of Pepcos property, plant and equipment. The principal amount of First Mortgage Bonds that Pepco may issue under the Mortgage is limited by the principal amount of retired First Mortgage Bonds and 60% of the lesser of the cost or fair value of new property additions that have not been used as the basis for the issuance of additional First Mortgage Bonds. Pepco also has an Indenture under which it issues senior notes secured by First Mortgage Bonds and an Indenture under which it can issue unsecured debt securities, including medium term notes. To fund the construction of pollution control facilities, Pepco also has from time to time issued tax exempt bonds through a municipality or public agency, the proceeds of which are loaned to Pepco by the municipality or agency. Information concerning the principal amount and terms of Pepcos outstanding First Mortgage Bonds, senior notes and medium term notes, and tax exempt bonds issued for the benefit of Pepco, as of December 31, 2009, is set forth in Note (10), Debt, to the Pepco financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Bank Financing As further discussed in Note (10), Debt, to the Pepco financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K, Pepco participates in a $1.5 billion credit facility, along with PHI, Delmarva Power & Light Company (DPL) and Atlantic City Electric Company (ACE). The facility, all or any portion of which may be used to obtain loans or to issue letters of credit, expires in 2012. Pepcos credit limit under the facility is the lesser of $500 million and the maximum amount of debt Pepco is permitted to have outstanding by its regulatory authorities, except that the aggregate amount of credit used by Pepco, DPL and ACE at any given time may not collectively exceed $625 million. Commercial Paper Program Pepco maintains an ongoing commercial paper program of up to $500 million under which it can issue commercial paper with maturities of up to 270 days. The commercial paper is backed by Pepcos borrowing capacity under the PHI $1.5 billion credit facility. Money Pool Pepco participates in the money pool operated by PHI under authorization received from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The money pool is a cash management mechanism used by PHI and eligible subsidiaries to manage their short term investment and borrowing requirements. PHI may invest in, but not borrow from, the money pool. Eligible subsidiaries with surplus cash may deposit those funds in the money pool. Deposits in the money pool are guaranteed by PHI. Eligible subsidiaries with cash requirements may borrow from the money pool. Borrowings from the money pool are unsecured. Depositors in the money pool receive, and borrowers from the money pool pay, an interest rate based primarily on PHIs short term borrowing rate. PHI deposits funds in the money pool to the extent that the pool has insufficient funds to meet the borrowing needs of its participants, which PHI may obtain from external sources. 100 Table of Contents PEPCO Preferred Stock Under its Articles of Incorporation, Pepco is authorized to issue and have outstanding up to 6 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series, with each series having such rights, preferences and limitations, including dividend and voting rights and redemption provisions, as the Board of Directors may establish. As of December 31, 2009, there were no shares of Pepco preferred stock outstanding. Regulatory Restrictions on Financing Activities Pepcos long term financing activities (including the issuance of securities and the incurrence of debt) are subject to authorization by the DCPSC and MPSC. Through its periodic filings with the respective utility commissions, Pepco generally seeks to maintain standing authority sufficient to cover its projected financing needs over a multi year period. Under the Federal Power Act, FERC has jurisdiction over the issuance of long term and short term securities of public utilities, but only if the issuance is not regulated by the state public utility commission in which the public utility is organized and operating. Under these provisions, Pepco is required to obtain FERC authorization for the issuance of short term debt. Capital Expenditures Pepcos capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2009, totaled $288 million. These expenditures were primarily related to capital costs associated with new customer services, distribution reliability and transmission. The following table shows Pepcos projected capital expenditures for the five year period 2010 through 2014. Pepco expects to fund these expenditures through internally generated cash and from external financing and capital contributions from PHI. For the Year 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Total (millions of dollars) Pepco Distribution $ 192 $ 235 $ 273 $ 276 $ 316 $ 1,292 Distribution Blueprint for the Future 58 103 19 180 Transmission 101 147 69 97 72 486 Transmission MAPP 7 129 201 114 70 521 Other 16 21 25 18 15 95 Sub Total 374 635 587 505 473 2,574 DOE Capital Reimbursement Awards (a) (28 ) (65 ) (22 ) (3 ) (118 ) Total Pepco $ 346 $ 570 $ 565 $ 502 $ 473 $ 2,456 (a) Amounts are presented on a gross basis on the assumption that the awards are not subject to federal or state tax. In 2009, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced a $149 million award to Pepco under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for the implementation of an advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) system, direct load control, distribution automation, and communications infrastructure. The Pepco service territory in Maryland and the District of Columbia were awarded $105 million and $44 million respectively. PHI is currently in the process of finalizing certain terms and conditions of the awards with the DOE. Of the $149 million, $118 million, as shown in the table above, will offset Blueprint for the Future and other capital expenditures that Pepco is projected to incur. The remaining $31 million will be used to help offset ongoing expenses associated with direct load control and other Power Delivery programs. 101 Table of Contents PEPCO Distribution and Transmission The projected capital expenditures listed in the table for distribution (other than Blueprint for the Future) and transmission (other than the Mid Atlantic Power Pathway (MAPP) project) are primarily for facility replacements and upgrades to accommodate customer growth and reliability. Blueprint for the Future For a discussion of the Blueprint for the Future initiative, see Item 1, Business Description of Business Blueprint for the Future of this Form 10 K. MAPP Project The total cost of the MAPP project is currently estimated to be $1.2 billion. For a discussion of the MAPP project, see Item 1, Business Description of Business MAPP Project of this Form 10 K. The cost of Pepcos portion of the MAPP project, as currently constituted, is estimated at $548 million. MAPP/DOE Loan Program PHI has applied for a $684 million loan guarantee from the DOE for a substantial portion of the MAPP project, primarily the Calvert Cliffs to Indian River segment. The loan guarantee is available under a loan guarantee program for projects that employ innovative energy efficiency, renewable energy and advanced transmission and distribution technologies. If granted, PHI believes that the guarantee would allow PHI to obtain financing at a lower cost than it would otherwise be able to obtain in the capital markets. Whether PHIs application will be granted and, if so, the amount of debt guaranteed is subject to the discretion of the DOE and the negotiation of terms that will satisfy the conditions of the terms of the guarantee program. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans Pepco participates in pension and postretirement benefit plans sponsored by PHI for its employees. While the plans have not experienced any significant impact in terms of liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the disruption of the capital and credit markets, the stock market declines in 2008 caused a decrease in the market value of benefit plan assets at the end of 2008. Pepco contributed $170 million to the pension plan during 2009.

General Overview Delmarva Power & Light Company (DPL) is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity in Delaware and portions of Maryland. DPL also provides Default Electricity Supply, which is the supply of electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territories who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive supplier. Default Electricity Supply is known as Standard Offer Service in both Delaware and Maryland. DPLs electricity distribution service territory covers approximately 5,000 square miles and has a population of approximately 1.3 million. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 67% of delivered electricity sales were to Delaware customers and approximately 33% were to Maryland customers. In northern Delaware, DPL also supplies and distributes natural gas to retail customers and provides transportation only services to retail customers that purchase natural gas from other suppliers. DPLs natural gas distribution service territory covers approximately 275 square miles and has a population of approximately 500,000. Effective January 2, 2008, DPL sold its Virginia retail electric distribution assets and its Virginia wholesale electric transmission assets. Effective June 2007, the Maryland Public Service Commission (MPSC) approved a bill stabilization adjustment mechanism (BSA) for retail customers. For customers to whom the BSA applies, DPL recognizes distribution revenue based on the approved distribution charge per customer. From a revenue recognition standpoint, this has the effect of decoupling distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period. As a consequence, the only factors that will cause distribution revenue in Maryland to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer. For customers to whom the BSA applies, changes in customer usage (such as due to weather conditions, energy prices, energy efficiency programs or other reasons) from period to period have no impact on reported distribution revenue. DPL is a wholly owned subsidiary of Conectiv, which is wholly owned by Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI or Pepco Holdings). Because PHI is a public utility holding company subject to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005), the relationship between PHI and DPL and certain activities of DPL are subject to the regulatory oversight of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under PUHCA 2005. 104 Table of Contents DPL Results Of Operations The following results of operations discussion compares the year ended December 31, 2009 to the year ended December 31, 2008. All amounts in the tables (except sales and customers) are in millions of dollars. Electric Operating Revenue 2009 2008 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 343 $ 353 $ (10 ) Default Electricity Supply Revenue 769 846 (77 ) Other Electric Revenue 23 22 1 Total Electric Operating Revenue $ 1,135 $ 1,221 $ (86 ) The table above shows the amount of Electric Operating Revenue earned that is subject to price regulation (Regulated Transmission & Distribution (T&D) Electric Revenue and Default Electricity Supply Revenue) and that which is not subject to price regulation (Other Electric Revenue). Regulated T&D Electric Revenue includes revenue from the delivery of electricity, including the delivery of Default Electricity Supply, to DPLs customers within its service territory at regulated rates. Regulated T&D Electric Revenue also includes transmission service revenue that DPL receives as a transmission owner from PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM). Default Electricity Supply Revenue is the revenue received from the supply of electricity by DPL at regulated rates to retail customers who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive supplier, which is also known as SOS service. The costs related to Default Electricity Supply are included in Purchased Energy. Other Electric Revenue includes work and services performed on behalf of customers, including other utilities, which is generally not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of pole attachments, late payment fees, and collection fees.

A decrease of $23 million due to lower non weather related customer usage. 106 Table of Contents DPL The following table shows the percentages of DPLs total distribution sales by jurisdiction that are derived from customers receiving Default Electricity Supply distribution from DPL. Amounts are for the years ended December 31: 2009 2008 Sales to Delaware customers 51 % 55 % Sales to Maryland customers 63 % 65 % Natural Gas Operating Revenue 2009 2008 Change Regulated Gas Revenue $ 228 $ 204 $ 24 Other Gas Revenue 40 114 (74 ) Total Natural Gas Operating Revenue $ 268 $ 318 $ (50 ) The table above shows the amounts of Natural Gas Operating Revenue from sources that are subject to price regulation (Regulated Gas Revenue) and those that generally are not subject to price regulation (Other Gas Revenue). Regulated Gas Revenue includes the revenue DPL receives from on system natural gas delivered sales and the transportation of natural gas for customers within its service territory at regulated rates. Other Gas Revenue includes off system natural gas sales and the short term release of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity not needed to serve customers. Off system sales are made possible when low demand for natural gas by regulated customers creates excess pipeline capacity.

An increase of $14 million (which is offset by a corresponding increase in Gas Purchased) associated with the recognition of the unbilled portion of Gas Cost Rate revenue in 2009, which was not previously recognized. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $5 million due to lower non weather related customer usage. A decrease of $4 million due to lower sales as a result of warmer weather during the fourth quarter of 2009, as compared to the corresponding period in 2008. Other Gas Revenue Other Gas Revenue decreased by $74 million primarily due to lower revenue from off system sales resulting from: A decrease of $67 million due to lower market prices. A decrease of $9 million due to lower demand from electric generators and gas marketers. Operating Expenses Purchased Energy Purchased Energy consists of the cost of electricity purchased by DPL to fulfill its Default Electricity Supply obligation and, as such, is recoverable from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders. Purchased Energy decreased by $70 million to $751 million in 2009 from $821 million in 2008 primarily due to: A decrease of $74 million primarily due to commercial and industrial customer migration to competitive suppliers. A decrease of $13 million due to lower average electricity costs under Default Electricity Supply contracts. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $15 million due to a higher rate of recovery of electricity supply costs resulting in a decrease in the Default Electricity Supply deferral balance. Gas Purchased Gas Purchased consists of the cost of gas purchased by DPL to fulfill its obligation to regulated gas customers and, as such, is recoverable from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders. It also includes the cost of gas purchased for off system sales. Total Gas Purchased decreased by $52 million to $193 million in 2009 from $245 million in 2008 primarily due to: A decrease of $73 million in the cost of gas purchases for off system sales, the result of lower average gas prices and volumes purchased. 108 Table of Contents DPL A decrease of $30 million in the cost of gas purchases for on system sales, the result of lower average gas prices and volumes purchased. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $43 million from the settlement of financial hedges entered into as part of DPLs hedge program for regulated natural gas. An increase of $12 million due to a higher rate of recovery of natural gas supply costs primarily as a result of recognizing the unbilled portion of Gas Cost Rate revenue in 2009, as discussed under Regulated Gas Revenue. Other Operation and Maintenance Other Operation and Maintenance increased by $16 million to $238 million in 2009 from $222 million in 2008. Excluding a decrease of $5 million primarily related to administrative expenses that are deferred and recoverable in Default Electricity Supply Revenue, Other Operation and Maintenance increased by $21 million. The $21 million increase was primarily due to: An increase of $15 million in employee related costs, primarily due to higher pension and other post retirement benefit expenses. An increase of $6 million primarily due to higher emergency restoration and tree trimming costs. During 2008, DPL recorded adjustments to correct errors in Other Operation and Maintenance for prior periods dating back to May 2006 during which (i) customer late payment fees were incorrectly recognized and (ii) stock based compensation expense related to certain restricted stock awards granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan was understated. These adjustments resulted in a total increase in Other Operation and Maintenance for the year ended December 31, 2008 of $5 million. These adjustments were not considered material either individually or in the aggregate. Gain on Sale of Assets Gain on Sale of Assets decreased by $4 million in 2009 due to a $4 million gain on the sale of the Virginia retail electric distribution and wholesale transmission assets in January 2008. Other Income (Expenses) Other Expenses (which are net of Other Income) increased by $7 million to a net expense of $42 million in 2009 from a net expense of $35 million in 2008. The increase was primarily due to a $10 million increase in interest expense on long term debt as the result of a higher amount of outstanding debt. Income Tax Expense DPLs effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were 23.5 % and 39.8%, respectively. The decrease in the rate primarily resulted from the refund of $6 million (after tax) of state income taxes and the establishment of a state tax benefit carryforward of $7 million (after tax), each related to a change in the tax reporting for the disposition of certain assets in prior years. This decrease is partially offset by the changes in estimates and interest related to uncertain and effectively settled tax positions and the non recurring adjustments to prior years taxes. 109 Table of Contents DPL Capital Requirements Sources of Capital DPL has a range of capital sources available, in addition to internally generated funds, to meet its long term and short term funding needs. The sources of long term funding include the issuance of mortgage bonds and other debt securities and bank financings, as well as the ability to issue preferred stock. Proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements, such as capital expenditures, and to repay or refinance existing indebtedness. DPL traditionally has used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs, including commercial paper, short term notes, bank lines of credit, and borrowings under the PHI money pool. Proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs, but may also be used to fund temporary long term capital requirements. DPLs ability to generate funds from its operations and to access the capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties. Volatile and deteriorating financial market conditions, diminished liquidity and tightening credit may affect access to certain of DPLs potential funding sources. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10 K, for additional discussion of important factors that may have an effect on DPLs sources of capital. Mortgage Bonds, Senior Notes, Medium Term Notes, Variable Rate Demand Bonds, and Tax Exempt Bonds DPL has a Mortgage and Deed of Trust (the Mortgage) under which it issues First Mortgage Bonds. First Mortgage Bonds issued under the Mortgage are secured by a lien on substantially all of DPLs property, plant and equipment. The principal amount of First Mortgage Bonds that DPL may issue under the Mortgage is limited by the principal amount of retired First Mortgage Bonds and 60% of the lesser of the cost or fair value of new property additions that have not been used as the basis for the issuance of additional First Mortgage Bonds. DPL also has an Indenture under which it issues unsecured senior notes, medium term notes and Variable Rate Demand Bonds. To fund the construction of pollution control facilities, DPL also has from time to time issued tax exempt bonds, including tax exempt Variable Rate Demand Bonds, through a public agency, the proceeds of which are loaned to DPL by the agency. Information concerning the principal amount and terms of DPLs outstanding First Mortgage Bonds, senior notes, medium term notes and Variable Rate Demand Bonds, and tax exempt bonds issued for the benefit of DPL, as of December 31, 2009, is set forth in Note (11), Debt, to the DPL financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Bank Financing As further discussed in Note (11), Debt, to the DPL financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K, DPL participates in a $1.5 billion credit facility, along with PHI, Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco) and Atlantic City Electric Company (ACE). The facility, all or any portion of which may be used to obtain loans or to issue letters of credit, expires in 2012. DPLs credit limit under the facility is the lesser of $500 million and the maximum amount of debt DPL is permitted to have outstanding by its regulatory authorities, except that the aggregate amount of credit used by DPL, Pepco and ACE at any given time may not collectively exceed $625 million. 110 Table of Contents DPL Commercial Paper Program DPL maintains an ongoing commercial paper program of up to $500 million under which it can issue commercial paper with maturities of up to 270 days. The commercial paper is backed by DPLs borrowing capacity under the PHI $1.5 billion credit facility.

S. Department of Energy (DOE) under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 in support of its Blueprint for the Future and other initiatives. Distribution, Transmission and Gas Delivery The projected capital expenditures listed in the table for distribution (other than Blueprint for the Future), transmission (other than the Mid Atlantic Power Pathway (MAPP) project) and gas delivery are primarily for facility replacements and upgrades to accommodate customer growth and reliability. Blueprint for the Future For a discussion of the Blueprint for the Future initiative, see Item 1, Business Description of Business Blueprint for the Future of this Form 10 K. MAPP Project The total cost of the MAPP project is currently estimated to be $1.2 billion. For a discussion of the MAPP project, see Item 1, Business Description of Business MAPP Project of this Form 10 K. The cost of DPLs portion of the MAPP project, as currently constituted, is estimated at $673 million. MAPP/DOE Loan Program PHI has applied for a $684 million loan guarantee from the Department of Energy for a substantial portion of the MAPP project, primarily the Calvert Cliffs to Indian River segment. The loan guarantee is available under a loan guarantee program for projects that employ innovative energy efficiency, renewable energy and advanced transmission and distribution technologies. If granted, PHI believes that the guarantee would allow PHI to obtain financing at a lower cost than it would otherwise be able to obtain in the capital markets. Whether PHIs application will be granted and, if so, the amount of debt guaranteed is subject to the discretion of the DOE and the negotiation of terms that will satisfy the conditions of the terms of the guarantee program. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans DPL participates in several of the pension and postretirement benefit plans sponsored by PHI and its subsidiaries for their employees. While the plans have not experienced any significant impact in terms of liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the disruption of the capital and credit markets, the stock market declines in 2008 caused a decrease in the market value of benefit plan assets at the end of 2008. DPL contributed $10 million to the pension plan during 2009.

General Overview Atlantic City Electric Company (ACE) is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity in southern New Jersey. ACE provides Default Electricity Supply, which is the supply of electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territory who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive supplier. Default Electricity Supply is also known as Basic Generation Service in New Jersey. ACEs service territory covers approximately 2,700 square miles and has a population of approximately 1.1 million. ACE is a wholly owned subsidiary of Conectiv, which is wholly owned by Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI or Pepco Holdings). Because PHI is a public utility holding company subject to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005), the relationship between PHI and ACE and certain activities of ACE are subject to the regulatory oversight of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under PUHCA 2005. 114 Table of Contents ACE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following results of operations discussion compares the year ended December 31, 2009 to the year ended December 31, 2008. All amounts in the tables (except sales and customers) are in millions of dollars. Operating Revenue 2009 2008 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 363 $ 359 $ 4 Default Electricity Supply Revenue 970 1,258 (288 ) Other Electric Revenue 18 16 2 Total Operating Revenue $ 1,351 $ 1,633 $ (282 ) The table above shows the amount of Operating Revenue earned that is subject to price regulation (Regulated Transmission & Distribution (T&D) Electric Revenue and Default Electricity Supply Revenue) and that which is not subject to price regulation (Other Electric Revenue). Regulated T&D Electric Revenue includes revenue from the delivery of electricity, including the delivery of Default Electricity Supply, to ACEs customers within its service territory at regulated rates. Regulated T&D Electric Revenue also includes transmission service revenue that ACE receives as a transmission owner from PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM). Default Electricity Supply Revenue is the revenue received from the supply of electricity by ACE at regulated rates to retail customers who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive supplier, and which is also known as Basic Generation Service (BGS). The costs related to Default Electricity Supply are included in Purchased Energy. Default Electricity Supply Revenue also includes revenue from Transition Bond Charges and other restructuring related revenues. Other Electric Revenue includes work and services performed on behalf of customers, including other utilities, which is generally not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of pole attachments, late payment fees, and collection fees. Regulated T&D Electric Regulated T&D Electric Revenue 2009 2008 Change Residential $ 161 $ 160 $ 1 Commercial and industrial 131 128 3 Other 71 71 Total Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 363 $ 359 $ 4 Other Regulated T&D Electric Revenue consists primarily of transmission service revenue.

The increase was partially offset by: A decrease of $7 million due to lower non weather related customer usage. A decrease of $5 million due to lower sales as a result of milder weather primarily during the 2009 spring and summer months as compared to 2008. Default Electricity Supply Default Electricity Supply Revenue 2009 2008 Change Residential $ 514 $ 525 $ (11 ) Commercial and industrial 316 418 (102 ) Other 140 315 (175 ) Total Default Electricity Supply Revenue $ 970 $ 1,258 $ (288 ) Other Default Electricity Supply Revenue consists primarily of revenue from the resale in the PJM Regional Transmission Organization market of energy and capacity purchased under contracts with unaffiliated, non utility generators (NUGs). Default Electricity Supply Sales (GWh) 2009 2008 Change Residential 4,280 4,388 (108 ) Commercial and industrial 2,681 3,458 (777 ) Other 49 49 Total Default Electricity Supply Sales 7,010 7,895 (885 ) Default Electricity Supply Customers (in thousands) 2009 2008 Change Residential 481 481 Commercial and industrial 62 65 (3 ) Other 1 1 Total Default Electricity Supply Customers 544 547 (3 ) 116 Table of Contents ACE Default Electricity Supply Revenue decreased by $288 million primarily due to: A decrease of $175 million in wholesale energy revenues due to lower market prices for the sale of electricity purchased from NUGs. A decrease of $65 million due to lower sales, primarily the result of commercial customer migration to competitive suppliers. A decrease of $22 million due to lower non weather related customer usage. A decrease of $14 million due to lower sales as a result of milder weather primarily during the 2009 spring and summer months as compared to 2008. A decrease of $12 million as the result of lower Default Electricity Supply rates. The decrease in total Default Electricity Supply Revenue includes a decrease of $8 million in unbilled revenue attributable to ACEs BGS. Under the BGS terms approved by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU), ACE is entitled to recover from its customers all of its costs of providing BGS. If the costs of providing BGS exceed the BGS revenue, then the excess costs are deferred in Deferred Electric Service Costs. ACEs BGS unbilled revenue is not included in the deferral calculation, and therefore has an impact on the results of operations in the period during which it is accrued. While the change in the amount of unbilled revenue from year to year typically is not significant, for the year ended December 31, 2009, BGS unbilled revenue decreased by $8 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, which resulted in a $5 million decrease in ACEs net income. The decrease was due to increased customer migration and lower customer usage during the unbilled revenue period at the end of 2009 as compared to the corresponding period in 2008. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the percentage of ACEs total distribution sales that are derived from customers receiving Default Electricity Supply are 73% and 78%, respectively. Operating Expenses Purchased Energy Purchased Energy consists of the cost of electricity purchased by ACE to fulfill its Default Electricity Supply obligation and, as such, is recoverable from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders. Purchased Energy decreased by $102 million to $1,076 million in 2009 from $1,178 million in 2008 primarily due to: A decrease of $115 million primarily due to commercial customer migration to competitive suppliers. A decrease of $17 million due to lower electricity sales as a result of milder weather primarily during the 2009 spring and summer months as compared to 2008. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $30 million due to higher average electricity costs under Default Electricity Supply contracts. Other Operation and Maintenance Other Operation and Maintenance increased by $7 million to $190 million in 2009 from $183 million in 2008 primarily due to an increase of $10 million in employee related pension and other postretirement benefit expenses. During 2008, ACE recorded an adjustment to correct errors in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses for certain restricted stock awards granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan. This adjustment resulted in an increase in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 of $1 million. This adjustment was not considered material. 117 Table of Contents ACE Deferred Electric Service Costs Deferred Electric Service Costs decreased by $152 million, to an expense reduction of $161 million in 2009 as compared to an expense reduction of $9 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to: A decrease of $186 million due to a lower rate of recovery of costs from the resale in the PJM RTO market of energy and capacity purchased under the NUG contracts. The decrease was partially offset by: An increase of $15 million due to a higher rate of recovery through customer rates of deferred energy costs of Default Electricity Supply (included in Default Electricity Supply Revenue). An increase of $13 million due to a higher rate of recovery through customer rates of New Jersey Societal Benefit program costs (included in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue). An increase of $5 million due to a higher rate of recovery through customer rates of deferred transmission costs of Default Electricity Supply (included in Default Electricity Supply Revenue). Other Income (Expenses) Other Expenses (which are net of Other Income) increased by $6 million to a net expense of $65 million in 2009 from a net expense of $59 million in 2008 primarily due to an increase of $13 million in interest expense on long term debt as the result of a higher amount of outstanding debt, partially offset by a decrease of $6 million in interest expense on the Default Electricity Supply deferral balance primarily due to lower short term debt rates. Income Tax Expense ACEs consolidated effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were 29.3 % and 31.9% respectively. The decrease in the rate primarily resulted from the reduction of deferred tax adjustments, a decrease in tax credits and adjustments to prior years taxes, partially offset by the impact of certain permanent state tax differences as a percentage of pre tax income and changes in estimates and interest related to uncertain and effectively settled tax positions related to casualty losses and fuel. Income Tax Adjustment During 2009, ACE recorded adjustments to correct certain income tax errors related to prior periods. These adjustments, which are not considered material, resulted in a decrease in income tax expense of $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Capital Requirements Sources of Capital ACE has a range of capital sources available, in addition to internally generated funds, to meet its long term and short term funding needs. The sources of long term funding include the issuance of mortgage bonds and other debt securities and bank financings, as well as preferred stock. Proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements, such as capital expenditures, and to repay or refinance existing indebtedness. ACE traditionally has used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs, including commercial paper, short term notes, bank lines of credit, and borrowings 118 Table of Contents ACE under the PHI money pool. Proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs, but may also be used to fund temporary long term capital requirements. ACEs ability to generate funds from its operations and to access the capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties. Volatile and deteriorating financial market conditions, diminished liquidity and tightening credit may affect access to certain of ACEs potential funding sources. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10 K, for additional discussion of important factors that may have an effect on ACEs sources of capital. Mortgage Bonds, Senior Notes, Variable Rate Demand Bonds, and Tax Exempt Bonds ACE has a Mortgage and Deed of Trust (the Mortgage) under which it issues First Mortgage Bonds. First Mortgage Bonds issued under the Mortgage are secured by a lien on substantially all of ACEs property, plant and equipment. The principal amount of First Mortgage Bonds that ACE may issue under the Mortgage is limited by the principal amount of retired First Mortgage Bonds and 65% of the lesser of the cost or fair value of new property additions that have not been used as the basis for the issuance of additional First Mortgage Bonds. ACE also has an Indenture under which it issues senior notes secured by First Mortgage Bonds and an Indenture under which it can issue unsecured debt securities, including Variable Rate Demand Bonds. To fund the construction of pollution control facilities, ACE also has from time to time issued tax exempt bonds, including tax exempt Variable Rate Demand Bonds, through a municipality, the proceeds of which are loaned to ACE by the municipality. Information concerning the principal amount and terms of ACEs outstanding First Mortgage Bonds, senior notes and Variable Rate Demand Bonds, and tax exempt bonds issued for the benefit of ACE, as of December 31, 2009, is set forth in Note (10), Debt, to the ACE financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Bank Financing As further discussed in Note (10), Debt, to the ACE financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K, ACE participates in a $1.5 billion credit facility, along with PHI, Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco) and Delmarva Power & Light Company (DPL). The facility, all or any portion of which may be used to obtain loans or to issue letters of credit expires in 2012. ACEs credit limit under the facility is the lesser of $500 million and the maximum amount of debt ACE is permitted to have outstanding by its regulatory authorities, except that the aggregate amount of credit used by ACE, Pepco and DPL at any given time may not collectively exceed $625 million. Commercial Paper Program ACE maintains an ongoing commercial paper program of up to $250 million under which it can issue commercial paper with maturities of up to 270 days. The commercial paper is backed by ACEs borrowing capacity under the PHI $1.5 billion credit facility. Money Pool ACE participates in the money pool operated by PHI under authorization received from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The money pool is a cash management mechanism used by PHI and eligible subsidiaries to manage their short term investment and borrowing requirements. PHI may invest in, but not borrow from, the money pool. Eligible subsidiaries with surplus cash may deposit those funds in the money pool. Deposits in the money pool are guaranteed by PHI. Eligible subsidiaries with cash requirements may borrow from the money pool. Borrowings from the money pool are unsecured. Depositors in the money pool receive, and borrowers from the money pool pay, an interest rate based primarily on PHIs short term borrowing rate. PHI deposits funds in the money pool to the extent that the pool has insufficient funds to meet the borrowing needs of its participants, which PHI may obtain from external sources. By regulatory order, the NJBPU has restricted ACEs participation in the PHI money pool. ACE may not invest in the money pool, but may borrow from it if the rates are lower than the rates at which ACE could borrow funds externally. 119 Table of Contents ACE Preferred Stock Under its Certificate of Incorporation, ACE is authorized to issue and have outstanding up to (i) 799,979 shares of Cumulative Preferred Stock, (ii) 2 million shares of No Par Preferred Stock and (iii) 3 million shares of Preference Stock, each such type of preferred stock having such terms and conditions as are set forth in or authorized by the Certificate of Incorporation. Information concerning the numbers of shares and the terms of ACEs outstanding shares of Cumulative Preferred Stock as of December 31, 2009, is set forth in Note (12), Preferred Stock, to the ACE financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. As of December 31, 2009, no shares of No Par Preferred Stock or Preference Stock were outstanding. Regulatory Restrictions on Financing Activities ACEs long term and short term (consisting of debt instruments with a maturity of one year or less) financing activities are subject to authorization by the NJBPU. Through its periodic filings with the NJBPU, ACE generally seeks to maintain standing authority sufficient to cover its projected financing needs over a multi year period. ACEs long term and short term financing activities do not require FERC approval. State corporate laws impose limitations on the funds that can be used to pay dividends. In addition, ACE must obtain the approval of the NJBPU before dividends can be paid if its equity as a percent of its total capitalization, excluding securitization debt, falls below 30%. Capital Expenditures ACEs capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2009, totaled $141 million. These expenditures were primarily related to capital costs associated with new customer services, distribution reliability and transmission. The following table shows ACEs updated projected capital expenditures for the five year period 2010 through 2014. ACE expects to fund these expenditures through internally generated cash and from external financing and capital contributions from PHI. For the Year 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Total (millions of dollars) ACE Distribution $ 94 $ 118 $ 135 $ 138 $ 129 $ 614 Distribution Blueprint for the Future 4 4 8 92 108 Transmission 29 20 31 68 38 186 Other 9 18 18 13 12 70 Sub Total 136 160 184 227 271 978 DOE Capital Reimbursement Awards (a) (2 ) (5 ) (4 ) (1 ) (12 ) Total ACE $ 134 $ 155 $ 180 $ 226 $ 271 $ 966 (a) Amounts are presented on a gross basis on the assumption that the awards are not subject to federal or state tax. 120 Table of Contents ACE In 2009, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced a $19 million award to ACE under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for the implementation of direct load control, distribution automation, and communications infrastructure in ACEs service territory. PHI is currently in the process of finalizing certain terms and conditions of the awards with the DOE. Of the $19 million, $12 million, as shown in the table above, will offset Blueprint for the Future and other capital expenditures that ACE is projected to incur. The remaining $7 million will be used to help offset ongoing expenses associated with direct load control and other Power Delivery programs. Distribution and Transmission The projected capital expenditures listed in the table for distribution (other than Blueprint for the Future) and transmissions are primarily for facility replacements and upgrades to accommodate customer growth and reliability. Blueprint for the Future For a discussion of the Blueprint for the Future initiative, see Item 1, Business Description of Business Blueprint for the Future of this Form 10 K. Distribution On April 16, 2009, the NJBPU approved ACEs proposed Infrastructure Investment Plan and the revenue requirement associated with recovering the cost of these projects, subject to a prudency review in the next rate case. The approved projects will simultaneously enhance reliability of ACEs distribution system and support economic activity and job growth in New Jersey in the near term. Cost recovery will be achieved through an Infrastructure Investment Surcharge, which became effective on June 1, 2009. This approved plan added incremental capital spending of approximately $8 million for 2009 and is expected to add an additional $19 million of capital spending for 2010, which is included in Distribution capital expenditures in the table above. ACE is required to file a rate case no later than April 1, 2011. As part of this base rate case, the remaining unamortized amounts associated with these projects will be placed into rate base. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans ACE participates in pension and postretirement benefit plans sponsored by PHI for employees. While the plans have not experienced any significant impact in terms of liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the disruption of the capital and credit markets, the stock market declines in 2008 caused a decrease in the market value of benefit plan assets at the end of 2008. ACE contributed $60 million to the pension plan during 2009. Forward Looking Statements Some of the statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are subject to the safe harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include declarations regarding ACEs intents, beliefs and current expectations. In some cases, you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may, will, should, expects, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential or continue or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology. Any forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results could differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements.

New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for ACE to predict all of such factors, nor can ACE assess the impact of any such factor on ACEs business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement. The foregoing review of factors should not be construed as exhaustive. 122 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Risk management policies for PHI and its subsidiaries are determined by PHIs Corporate Risk Management Committee, the members of which are PHIs Chief Risk Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Chief Information Officer and other senior executives. The Corporate Risk Management Committee monitors interest rate fluctuation, commodity price fluctuation, and credit risk exposure, and sets risk management policies that establish limits on unhedged risk and determine risk reporting requirements. For information about PHIs derivative activities, other than the information disclosed herein, refer to Note (2), Significant Accounting Policies Accounting For Derivatives and Note (15), Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to the consolidated financial statements of PHI set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Pepco Holdings, Inc. Commodity Price Risk The Competitive Energy segments actively engage in commodity risk management activities to reduce their financial exposure to changes in the value of their assets and obligations due to commodity price fluctuations. Certain of these risk management activities are conducted using instruments classified as derivatives based on FASB guidance on derivatives and hedging (ASC 815). The Competitive Energy segments also manage commodity risk with contracts that are not classified as derivatives. The Competitive Energy segments primary risk management objectives are (1) to manage the spread between the cost of fuel used to operate their electric generation facilities and the revenue received from the sale of the power produced by those facilities by selling forward a portion of their projected plant output and buying forward a portion of their projected fuel supply requirements and (2) to manage the spread between wholesale and retail sales commitments and the cost of supply used to service those commitments in order to ensure stable and known cash flows and fix favorable prices and margins when they become available. PHIs risk management policies place oversight at the senior management level through the Corporate Risk Management Committee, which has the responsibility for establishing corporate compliance requirements for the Competitive Energy business energy market participation. PHI collectively refers to these energy market activities, including its commodity risk management activities, as energy commodity activities. PHI uses a value at risk (VaR) model to assess the market risk of its Competitive Energy segments energy commodity activities. PHI also uses other measures to limit and monitor risk in its energy commodity activities, including limits on the nominal size of positions and periodic loss limits. VaR represents the potential fair value loss on energy contracts or portfolios due to changes in market prices for a specified time period and confidence level. In January 2009, PHI changed its VaR estimation model from a delta normal variance / covariance model to a delta gamma model. The other parameters, a 95 percent, one tailed confidence level and a one day holding period, remained the same. Since VaR is an estimate, it is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur. The table below provides the VaR associated with energy contracts for the year ended December 31, 2009 in millions of dollars: VaR forCompetitiveEnergyCommodityActivity (a) 95% confidence level, one day holding period, one tailed Period end $ 5 Average for the period $ 4 High $ 9 Low $ 2 (a) This column represents all energy derivative contracts, normal purchase and normal sales contracts, modeled generation output and fuel requirements, and modeled customer load obligations for PHIs energy commodity activities. 123 Table of Contents Conectiv Energy economically hedges both the estimated plant output and fuel requirements as the estimated levels of output and fuel needs change. Economic hedges include the estimated electricity output of Conectiv Energys generating facilities and any associated financial or physical commodity contracts (including derivative contracts that are classified as cash flow hedges, other derivative instruments, wholesale normal purchase and normal sales contracts, and default electricity supply contracts). Conectiv Energy maintains a forward 36 month program for economically hedging its projected plant output combined with its energy purchase commitments. During the fourth quarter of 2009, Conectiv Energy transitioned to the use of dynamic spread option models to capture the value of its generation portfolio. The model computes the probability of run time derived from forward market prices for power and fuel, and then computes the desired hedge positions, over the next 36 months. Conectiv executes power and fuel hedges according to the models projections based on forward market prices and volatilities. The primary purpose of the risk management program is to improve the predictability and stability of margins by selling forward a portion of projected plant output, and buying forward a matched portion of projected fuel supply requirements. Not all of the value associated with Conectiv Energys generation activities can be hedged such as the portion attributable to ancillary services and fuel switching due to the lack of market products, market liquidity, and other factors. Also, the hedging of locational value can be limited due to market liquidity. Since the inception of the Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) in PJM, Conectiv Energy has taken steps to ensure a reasonable return on its generation capacity. Prior to the commencement of the first RPM auction for the 2007 2008 PJM planning year, Conectiv Energy sold a portion of its capacity forward into the over the counter market. Conectiv Energy continues to sell some of its capacity into the forward market when it believes prices are favorable. Conectiv Energy also reserves some of its capacity to serve full requirements load within PJM. Conectiv Energy recovers the value of this capacity by including it in the price offered for the bundled load service in individual load auctions. Pepco Energy Services purchases electric and natural gas futures, swaps, options and forward contracts to hedge price risk in connection with the purchase of physical natural gas and electricity for delivery to customers. Pepco Energy Services accounts for its futures and swap contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions. Its options contracts and certain commodity contracts that do not qualify as cash flow hedges are marked to market through current earnings. Its forward contracts are accounted for using standard accrual accounting since these contracts meet the requirements for normal purchase and normal sale accounting under FASB guidance on derivatives and hedging. 124 Table of Contents Credit and Nonperformance Risk Pepco Holdings subsidiaries attempt to minimize credit risk exposure to wholesale energy counterparties through, among other things, formal credit policies, regular assessment of counterparty creditworthiness and the establishment of a credit limit for each counterparty, monitoring procedures that include stress testing, the use of standard agreements which allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty and collateral requirements under certain circumstances, and have established reserves for credit losses. As of December 31, 2009, credit exposure to wholesale energy counterparties was weighted 88% with investment grade counterparties, 8% with counterparties without external credit quality ratings, and 4% with non investment grade counterparties. The following table provides information on the Competitive Energy business credit exposure on competitive wholesale energy contracts, net of collateral, to wholesale counterparties as of December 31, 2009, in millions of dollars. Rating (a) Exposure BeforeCreditCollateral (b) CreditCollateral (c) NetExposure Number ofCounterpartiesGreater Than10% (d) Net Exposure ofCounterpartiesGreater Than 10% Investment Grade $ 243 $ 1 $ 242 3 $ 163 Non Investment Grade 10 1 9 No External Ratings 24 9 15 Credit reserves $ 1 (a) Investment Grade primarily determined using publicly available credit ratings of the counterparty. If the counterparty has provided a guarantee by a higher rated entity (e.g., its parent), it is determined based upon the rating of its guarantor. Included in Investment Grade are counterparties with a minimum Standard & Poors or Moodys Investor Service rating of BBB or Baa3, respectively. (b) Exposure before credit collateral includes the marked to market (MTM) energy contract net assets for open/unrealized transactions, the net receivable/payable for realized transactions and net open positions for contracts not subject to MTM. Amounts due from counterparties are offset by liabilities payable to those counterparties to the extent that legally enforceable netting arrangements are in place. Thus, this column presents the net credit exposure to counterparties after reflecting all allowable netting, but before considering collateral held. (c) Credit collateral the face amount of cash deposits, letters of credit and performance bonds received from counterparties, not adjusted for probability of default, and, if applicable, property interests (including oil and gas reserves). (d) Using a percentage of the total exposure. Interest Rate Risk Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries variable or floating rate debt is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. Pepco Holdings manages interest rates through the use of fixed and, to a lesser extent, variable rate debt. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates on the annual interest costs for short term and variable rate debt was approximately $1 million as of December 31, 2009. Potomac Electric Power Company Interest Rate Risk Pepco does not have any long term debt with variable or floating rates. Delmarva Power & Light Company Commodity Price Risk DPL uses derivative instruments (forward contracts, futures, swaps, and exchange traded and over the counter options) primarily to reduce gas commodity price volatility while limiting its customers exposure to increases in the market price of gas.
