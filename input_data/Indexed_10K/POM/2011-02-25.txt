Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The information required by this item is contained herein, as follows: Registrants Page No. Pepco Holdings 34 Pepco 88 DPL 100 ACE 111 33 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Pepco Holdings, Inc. General Overview Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI or Pepco Holdings), a Delaware corporation incorporated in 2001, is a holding company that, through its regulated public utility subsidiaries, is engaged primarily in the transmission, distribution and default supply of electricity and the distribution and supply of natural gas (Power Delivery). Through Pepco Energy Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, Pepco Energy Services), PHI provides energy efficiency services primarily to government and institutional customers and is in the process of winding down its competitive electricity and natural gas retail supply business. Each of Power Delivery and Pepco Energy Services constitutes a separate segment for financial reporting purposes. A third segment, Other Non Regulated, owns a portfolio of eight cross border energy lease investments. The following table sets forth the percentage contributions to consolidated operating revenue and operating income from continuing operations attributable to the Power Delivery, Pepco Energy Services and Other Non Regulated segments: December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Percentage of Consolidated Operating Revenue Power Delivery 73 % 67 % 68 % Pepco Energy Services 27 % 32 % 33 % Other Non Regulated 1 % (1 )% Percentage of Consolidated Operating Income Power Delivery 81 % 78 % 101 % Pepco Energy Services 11 % 14 % 10 % Other Non Regulated 8 % 8 % (11 )% Percentage of Power Delivery Operating Revenue Power Delivery Electric 95 % 95 % 94 % Power Delivery Gas 5 % 5 % 6 % Power Delivery Power Delivery Electric consists primarily of the transmission, distribution and default supply of electricity, and Power Delivery Gas consists of the delivery and supply of natural gas. Power Delivery represents a single operating segment for financial reporting purposes. The Power Delivery business is conducted by PHIs three utility subsidiaries: Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco), Delmarva Power & Light Company (DPL) and Atlantic City Electric Company (ACE). Each of these companies is a regulated public utility in the jurisdictions that comprise its service territory. Each company is responsible for the distribution of electricity and, in the case of DPL, natural gas in its service territory, for which it is paid tariff rates established by the applicable local public service commission. Each company also supplies electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territory who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier. The regulatory term for this supply service is Standard Office Service (SOS) in Delaware, the District of Columbia and Maryland and Basic Generation Service (BGS) in New Jersey. In this Form 10 K, these supply service obligations are referred to generally as Default Electricity Supply. 34 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Pepco, DPL and ACE are also responsible for the transmission of wholesale electricity into and across their service territories. The rates each company is permitted to charge for the wholesale transmission of electricity are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Transmission rates are updated annually based on a FERC approved formula methodology. The profitability of the Power Delivery business depends on its ability to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on its capital investments through the rates it is permitted to charge. The Power Delivery operating results historically have been seasonal, generally producing higher revenue and income in the warmest and coldest periods of the year. Operating results also can be affected by economic conditions, energy prices and the impact of energy efficiency measures on customer usage of electricity. As a result of the implementation of a bill stabilization adjustment mechanism (BSA) for retail customers of Pepco and DPL in Maryland in June 2007 and for customers of Pepco in the District of Columbia in November 2009, Pepco and DPL recognize distribution revenue based on an approved distribution charge per customer. From a revenue recognition standpoint, this has the effect of decoupling distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period. As a consequence, the only factors that will cause distribution revenue in Maryland and the District of Columbia to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer. For customers to whom the BSA applies, changes in customer usage (such as due to weather conditions, energy prices, energy efficiency programs or other reasons) from period to period have no impact on reported distribution revenue. As a result of the BSA in Maryland and the District of Columbia, a Revenue Decoupling Adjustment is recorded representing either (i) a positive adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from Maryland and District and Columbia retail distribution sales falls short of the revenue that Pepco and DPL are entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer or (ii) a negative adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from such distribution sales exceeds the revenue that Pepco and DPL are entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer. Pepco Energy Services The business of the Pepco Energy Services segment has consisted primarily of (i) the retail supply of electricity and natural gas and (ii) providing energy savings performance contracting services principally to federal, state and local government customers, and designing, constructing and operating combined heat and power and central energy plants for customers (Energy Services). Pepco Energy Services also owns and operates two oil fired generation facilities. In December 2009, PHI announced that it will wind down the retail energy supply component of the Pepco Energy Services business. The decision was made after considering, among other factors, the return PHI earns by investing capital in the retail energy supply business as compared to alternative investments. To effectuate the wind down, Pepco Energy Services will continue to fulfill all of its commercial and regulatory obligations and perform its customer service functions to ensure that it meets the needs of its existing customers, but will not be entering into any new retail energy supply contracts. Operating revenues related to the retail energy supply business for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $1.6 billion, $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, and operating income for the same periods was $59 million, $88 million and $54 million, respectively. PHI expects the retail energy supply business to remain profitable through December 31, 2012, based on its existing contract backlog and its corresponding portfolio of wholesale hedges, with immaterial losses beyond that date. Substantially all of Pepco Energy Services retail customer obligations will be fully performed by June 1, 2014. 35 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS In connection with the operation of the retail energy supply business, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, Pepco Energy Services has collateral pledged to counterparties primarily for the instruments it uses to hedge commodity price risk of approximately $230 million and $280 million, respectively. Of the December 31, 2010 collateral amount, $113 million was in the form of letters of credit and $117 million was posted in cash. Pepco Energy Services estimates that at current market prices, with the wind down of the retail energy supply business, this collateral will be released as follows: an aggregate of 64% by December 31, 2011, an aggregate of 92% by December 31, 2012, and substantially all collateral by June 1, 2014. As a result of the decision to wind down the retail energy supply business, Pepco Energy Services in the fourth quarter of 2009 recorded (i) a $4 million pre tax impairment charge reflecting the write off of all goodwill allocated to the business and (ii) a pre tax charge of less than $1 million related to employee severance. Pepco Energy Services remaining businesses will not be affected by the wind down of the retail energy supply business. Other Non Regulated Through its subsidiary Potomac Capital Investment Corporation, PHI maintains a portfolio of cross border energy lease investments with a book value at December 31, 2010 of approximately $1.4 billion. This activity constitutes a third operating segment, which is designated as Other Non Regulated, for financial reporting purposes. For a discussion of PHIs cross border energy lease investments, see Note (17), Commitments and Contingencies Regulatory and Other Matters PHIs Cross Border Energy Lease Investments, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Discontinued Operations On April 20, 2010, the Board of Directors of PHI approved a plan for the disposition of Conectiv Energy, which is comprised of Conectiv Energy Holding Company and its subsidiaries. On July 1, 2010, PHI completed the sale of Conectiv Energys wholesale power generation business to Calpine for $1.64 billion. The disposition of all of Conectiv Energys remaining assets and businesses not included in the Calpine sale, including its load service supply contracts, energy hedging portfolio and certain tolling agreements, has been substantially completed. The operations of Conectiv Energy, which previously comprised a separate segment for financial reporting purposes, have been classified as a discontinued operation in PHIs consolidated financial statements for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 and the business is no longer being treated as a separate segment for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, all references to continuing operations exclude the operations of the former Conectiv Energy segment. 36 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Business Strategy PHIs business strategy is to remain a mid Atlantic regional energy distribution utility company focused on value creation, operational excellence and environmental responsibility. The components of this strategy include: Achieving earnings growth in the Power Delivery business by focusing on transmission and distribution infrastructure investments and constructive regulatory outcomes, while maintaining a high level of operational excellence. Pursuing technologies and practices that promote energy efficiency, energy conservation and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Supplementing PHIs utility earnings through Pepco Energy Services by providing energy performance services and renewable energy and combined heat and power alternatives to commercial, industrial and government customers. To further this business strategy, PHI may from time to time examine a variety of transactions involving its existing businesses, including the entry into joint ventures or the disposition of one or more businesses, as well as possible acquisitions. PHI also may reassess or refine the components of its business strategy as it deems necessary or appropriate in response to a wide variety of factors, including the requirements of its businesses, competitive conditions and regulatory requirements. 37 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Earnings Overview Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2009 PHIs net income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $139 million, or $0.62 per share, compared to $223 million, or $1.01 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2009. Net income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2010, included the charges set forth below in the business segments noted, which are presented net of federal and state income taxes and are in millions of dollars: Debt extinguishment costs including treasury lock hedge (Corporate and Other) $ 113 Restructuring charge (All segments) $ 18 Effects of Pepco divestiture related claims (Power Delivery) $ 6 Excluding these items, net income from continuing operations would have been $276 million, or $1.24 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2010. Net income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2009, included the credits set forth below in the Power Delivery segment, which are presented net of federal and state income taxes and are in millions of dollars: Settlement of Pepco divestiture related Mirant Corporation (Mirant) bankruptcy claims $ 24 Maryland income tax benefit, net of fees $ 11 Excluding these items, net income from continuing operations would have been $188 million, or $0.85 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2009. PHIs net loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $107 million, or $0.48 per share, compared to net income of $12 million, or $0.05 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2009. PHIs net income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, by operating segment, is set forth in the table below (in millions of dollars): 2010 2009 Change Power Delivery $ 206 $ 199 $ 7 Pepco Energy Services 36 40 (4 ) Other Non Regulated 25 31 (6 ) Corporate and Other (128 ) (47 ) (81 ) Net Income from Continuing Operations 139 223 (84 ) Discontinued Operations (107 ) 12 (119 ) Total PHI Net Income $ 32 $ 235 $ (203 ) 38 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Discussion of Operating Segment Net Income Variances: Power Deliverys $7 million increase in earnings is primarily due to the following: $51 million increase from higher distribution revenue consisting of: a $24 million increase due to distribution rate increases (Pepco in the District of Columbia effective November 2009 and March 2010; DPL in Maryland effective December 2009; DPL in Delaware effective April 2010; and ACE in New Jersey effective June 2010); and a $27 million increase due to higher distribution sales, primarily due to weather, usage and growth in the number of customers. $21 million increase from higher transmission revenue primarily due to higher rates effective June 1, 2010 related to an increase in transmission plant investment. $11 million increase in Other Income (Expense), primarily an increase in the Allowance for Funds Used During Construction and gains on the disposal of assets. $6 million increase associated with ACE Basic Generation Service primarily attributable to an increase in unbilled revenue due to higher usage and higher rates. The aggregate of these increases was partially offset by: $27 million decrease due to higher operating and maintenance costs primarily resulting from February, July and August 2010 storm restoration activity, system maintenance (tree trimming) and estimated environmental remediation costs. $24 million decrease due to the 2009 favorable earnings impact of the approvals by the District of Columbia Public Service Commission (DCPSC) and the Maryland Public Service Commission (MPSC) of Pepcos proposals for sharing the proceeds of the Mirant bankruptcy settlement remaining after the transfer of the Panda PPA to a third party. $17 million decrease due to a restructuring charge recorded in 2010. $8 million decrease related to income tax adjustments consisting of: $13 million decrease due to 2009 earnings impact of a Maryland income tax benefit related to a change in tax reporting for the disposition of certain assets in prior years; offset by $5 million net increase due to the impact of interest related to effectively settled and uncertain tax positions in 2010. $6 million decrease due to a 2010 order by the DCPSC associated with the effects of Pepco divestiture related claims. Pepco Energy Services $4 million decrease in earnings is primarily due to the following: $18 million decrease due to lower retail electricity sales volumes due to the ongoing wind down of the retail electricity supply business, and lower gross margins due to low demand in the retail natural gas business. 39 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS $6 million decrease due to repair costs associated with a thermal services distribution system pipe leak and higher costs associated with operating a customers cogeneration plant; partially offset by increased high voltage construction activity. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: $11 million increase due to higher electricity generation output that resulted from warmer than normal weather; partially offset by power plant maintenance costs. $8 million increase due to lower interest and other expenses, primarily associated with credit and collateral facilities for the retail energy supply business. Other Non Regulateds $6 million decrease in earnings is primarily due to favorable income tax benefits recorded in 2009. Corporate and Others $81 million decrease in earnings is primarily due to the unfavorable impact of $113 million of debt extinguishment costs related to the purchase of outstanding debt with the proceeds from the sale of the Conectiv Energy wholesale power generation business; partially offset by the favorable impact of $22 million of net state income tax benefits related to the April 2010 corporate restructuring and $8 million of lower interest expense. The $119 million decrease in earnings from discontinued operations was primarily due to the recognition of a loss associated with the sale of the wholesale power generation business to Calpine Corporation and unrealized losses on derivative instruments no longer qualifying for cash flow hedge accounting, partially offset by gains recognized on sales of load service supply contracts. 40 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Consolidated Results of Operations The following results of operations discussion is for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. All amounts in the tables (except sales and customers) are in millions of dollars. Continuing Operations Operating Revenue A detail of the components of PHIs consolidated operating revenue is as follows: 2010 2009 Change Power Delivery $ 5,114 $ 4,980 $ 134 Pepco Energy Services 1,883 2,383 (500 ) Other Non Regulated 54 51 3 Corporate and Other (12 ) (12 ) Total Operating Revenue $ 7,039 $ 7,402 $ (363 ) Power Delivery Business The following table categorizes Power Deliverys operating revenue by type of revenue. 2010 2009 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 1,858 $ 1,653 $ 205 Default Electricity Supply Revenue 2,951 2,990 (39 ) Other Electric Revenue 68 69 (1 ) Total Electric Operating Revenue 4,877 4,712 165 Regulated Gas Revenue 191 228 (37 ) Other Gas Revenue 46 40 6 Total Gas Operating Revenue 237 268 (31 ) Total Power Delivery Operating Revenue $ 5,114 $ 4,980 $ 134 Regulated Transmission and Distribution (T&D) Electric Revenue includes revenue from the distribution of electricity, including the distribution of Default Electricity Supply, by PHIs utility subsidiaries to customers within their service territories at regulated rates. Regulated T&D Electric Revenue also includes transmission service revenue that PHIs utility subsidiaries receive as transmission owners from the PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM) at rates regulated by FERC. Default Electricity Supply Revenue is the revenue received from the supply of electricity by PHIs utility subsidiaries at regulated rates to retail customers who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier. Depending on the jurisdiction, Default Electricity Supply is also known as Standard Offer Service or Basic Generation Service (BGS). The costs related to Default Electricity Supply are included in Fuel and Purchased Energy. Default Electricity Supply Revenue also includes revenue from Transition Bond Charges that ACE receives, and pays to Atlantic City Electric Transition Funding LLC (ACE Funding), to fund the principal and interest payments on Transition Bonds issued by ACE Funding and revenue in the form of transmission enhancement credits that PHI utility subsidiaries receive as transmission owners from PJM for approved regional transmission expansion plan costs (Transmission Enhancement Credits). 41 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Other Electric Revenue includes work and services performed on behalf of customers, including other utilities, which is generally not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of pole attachments, late payment fees, and collection fees. Regulated Gas Revenue includes the revenue DPL receives from on system natural gas delivered sales and the transportation of natural gas for customers within its service territory at regulated rates. Other Gas Revenue consists of DPLs off system natural gas sales and the short term release of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity not needed to serve customers. Off system sales are made possible when low demand for natural gas by regulated customers creates excess pipeline capacity. Regulated T&D Electric 2010 2009 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue Residential $ 683 $ 596 $ 87 Commercial and industrial 883 804 79 Other 292 253 39 Total Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 1,858 $ 1,653 $ 205 Other Regulated T&D Electric Revenue consists primarily of transmission service revenue. 2010 2009 Change Regulated T&D Electric Sales (Gigawatt hours(GWh)) Residential 18,398 16,871 1,527 Commercial and industrial 32,045 31,570 475 Other 260 261 (1 ) Total Regulated T&D Electric Sales 50,703 48,702 2,001 2010 2009 Change Regulated T&D Electric Customers (in thousands) Residential 1,635 1,623 12 Commercial and industrial 198 198 Other 2 2 Total Regulated T&D Electric Customers 1,835 1,823 12 The Pepco, DPL and ACE service territories are located within a corridor extending from the District of Columbia to southern New Jersey. These service territories are economically diverse and include key industries that contribute to the regional economic base. Commercial activity in the region includes banking and other professional services, government, insurance, real estate, shopping malls, casinos, stand alone construction, and tourism. Industrial activity in the region includes chemical, glass, pharmaceutical, steel manufacturing, food processing, and oil refining. 42 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Regulated T&D Electric Revenue increased by $205 million primarily due to: An increase of $61 million due to higher pass through revenue (which is substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Other Taxes) primarily the result of rate increases in Montgomery County, Maryland utility taxes that are collected by Pepco on behalf of the county. An increase of $46 million due to distribution rate increases (Pepco in the District of Columbia effective November 2009 and March 2010; DPL in Maryland effective December 2009; DPL in Delaware effective April 2010; and ACE in New Jersey effective June 2010). An increase of $37 million in transmission revenue primarily attributable to higher rates effective June 1, 2010 related to an increase in transmission plant investment. An increase of $26 million due to higher revenue in the District of Columbia, Delaware and New Jersey service territories, primarily as a result of warmer weather during the 2010 spring and summer months as compared to 2009. Distribution revenue in Maryland was decoupled from consumption in 2010 and 2009, and therefore, the weather in this jurisdiction does not affect the period to period comparison. The BSA was not implemented in the District of Columbia until November 2009, and therefore, the period to period comparison is affected by weather. An increase of $15 million due to the implementation of the EmPower Maryland (demand side management program for Pepco and DPL) surcharge in March 2010 (which is substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Depreciation and Amortization). An increase of $9 million due to higher non weather related average customer usage. An increase of $8 million due to Pepco customer growth of 1% in 2010, primarily in the residential class. Default Electricity Supply 2010 2009 Change Default Electricity Supply Revenue Residential $ 2,022 $ 1,915 $ 107 Commercial and industrial 733 915 (182 ) Other 196 160 36 Total Default Electricity Supply Revenue $ 2,951 $ 2,990 $ (39 ) Other Default Electricity Supply Revenue consists primarily of (i) revenue from the resale by ACE in the PJM Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) market of energy and capacity purchased under contracts with unaffiliated non utility generators (NUGs), and (ii) revenue from Transmission Enhancement Credits. 2010 2009 Change Default Electricity Supply Sales (GWh) Residential 17,385 16,274 1,111 Commercial and industrial 7,034 8,470 (1,436 ) Other 93 101 (8 ) Total Default Electricity Supply Sales 24,512 24,845 (333 ) 43 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS 2010 2009 Change Default Electricity Supply Customers (in thousands) Residential 1,525 1,572 (47 ) Commercial and industrial 148 159 (11 ) Other 1 2 (1 ) Total Default Electricity Supply Customers 1,674 1,733 (59 ) Default Electricity Supply Revenue decreased by $39 million primarily due to: A decrease of $200 million due to lower sales, primarily as a result of commercial customer migration to competitive suppliers. A decrease of $59 million as a result of lower Default Electricity Supply rates. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $144 million due to higher sales primarily as a result of warmer weather during the 2010 spring and summer months as compared to 2009. An increase of $40 million due to higher non weather related average customer usage. An increase of $29 million in wholesale energy and capacity revenues primarily due to higher market prices for the sale of electricity and capacity purchased from NUGs. An increase of $8 million due to an increase in revenue from Transmission Enhancement Credits. Total Default Electricity Supply Revenue for the 2010 period includes an increase of $8 million in unbilled revenue attributable to ACEs BGS. Under the BGS terms approved by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, ACE is entitled to recover from its customers all of its costs of providing BGS. If the costs of providing BGS exceed the BGS revenue, then the excess costs are deferred in Deferred Electric Service Costs. ACEs BGS unbilled revenue (which is the result of the recognition of revenue when the electricity is delivered, as opposed to when it is billed) is not included in the deferral calculation, and therefore has an impact on the results of operations in the period during which it is accrued. While the change in the amount of unbilled revenue from year to year typically is not significant, for the year ended December 31, 2010, BGS unbilled revenue increased by $8 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, which resulted in a $5 million increase in PHIs net income. The increase was primarily due to higher Default Electricity Supply rates and colder weather during the unbilled revenue period at the end of 2010 as compared to the corresponding period in 2009. Regulated Gas 2010 2009 Change Regulated Gas Revenue Residential $ 118 $ 139 $ (21 ) Commercial and industrial 65 81 (16 ) Transportation and other 8 8 Total Regulated Gas Revenue $ 191 $ 228 $ (37 ) 44 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS 2010 2009 Change Regulated Gas Sales (billion cubic feet) Residential 8 8 Commercial and industrial 5 5 Transportation and other 6 6 Total Regulated Gas Sales 19 19 2010 2009 Change Regulated Gas Customers (in thousands) Residential 114 113 1 Commercial and industrial 9 10 (1 ) Transportation and other Total Regulated Gas Customers 123 123 DPLs natural gas service territory is located in New Castle County, Delaware. Several key industries contribute to the economic base as well as to growth. Commercial activity in the region includes banking and other professional services, government, insurance, real estate, shopping malls, stand alone construction, and tourism. Industrial activity in the region includes chemical and pharmaceutical. Regulated Gas Revenue decreased by $37 million primarily due to: A decrease of $22 million due to Gas Cost Rate decreases effective March 2009 and November 2009. A decrease of $14 million due to lower sales as a result of milder weather during the 2010 winter months as compared to 2009. Other Gas Revenue Other Gas Revenue increased by $6 million primarily due to higher revenue from off system sales resulting from: An increase of $4 million due to higher demand from electric generators and natural gas marketers. An increase of $2 million due to higher market prices. Pepco Energy Services Pepco Energy Services operating revenue decreased $500 million primarily due to: A decrease of $651 million due to lower retail electricity sales volume due to the ongoing wind down of the retail energy supply business. The decrease is partially offset by: An increase of $100 million due to higher electricity generation output as the result of completed transmission construction projects and warmer than normal weather, and lower Reliability Pricing Model charges associated with the generating facilities. 45 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS An increase of $38 million due to increased high voltage and energy services construction activities. An increase of $13 million due to a higher retail natural gas supply load as the result of 2009 customer acquisitions, partially offset by lower retail natural gas prices. Operating Expenses Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales A detail of PHIs consolidated Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales is as follows: 2010 2009 Change Power Delivery $ 3,086 $ 3,243 $ (157 ) Pepco Energy Services 1,691 2,179 (488 ) Corporate and Other (6 ) (7 ) 1 Total $ 4,771 $ 5,415 $ (644 ) Power Delivery Business Power Deliverys Fuel and Purchased Energy consists of the cost of electricity and natural gas purchased by its utility subsidiaries to fulfill their respective Default Electricity Supply and Regulated Gas obligations and, as such, is recoverable from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders. It also includes the cost of natural gas purchased for off system sales. Fuel and Purchased Energy expense decreased by $157 million primarily due to: A decrease of $197 million primarily due to commercial customer migration to competitive suppliers. A decrease of $59 million in deferred electricity expense primarily due to lower Default Electricity Supply Revenue rates, which resulted in a lower rate of recovery of Default Electricity Supply costs. A decrease of $17 million in deferred natural gas expense as a result of a lower rate of recovery of natural gas supply costs. A decrease of $14 million due to lower average electricity costs under Default Electricity Supply contracts. A decrease of $12 million from the settlement of financial hedges entered into as part of DPLs hedge program for regulated natural gas. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $143 million due to higher electricity sales primarily as a result of warmer weather during the 2010 spring and summer months as compared to 2009. Pepco Energy Services Pepco Energy Services Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales decreased $488 million primarily due to: A decrease of $571 million due to lower volumes of electricity purchased to serve decreased retail customer load as a result of the ongoing wind down of the retail energy supply business. 46 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS The decrease is partially offset by: An increase of $42 million due to increased high voltage and energy services construction activities. An increase of $27 million due to higher fuel usage associated with the generating facilities. An increase of $15 million due to a higher retail natural gas supply load as the result of 2009 customer acquisitions, partially offset by lower wholesale natural gas prices. Other Operation and Maintenance A detail of PHIs Other operation and maintenance expense is as follows: 2010 2009 Change Power Delivery $ 809 $ 752 $ 57 Pepco Energy Services 95 90 5 Other Non Regulated 4 2 2 Corporate and Other (24 ) (25 ) 1 Total $ 884 $ 819 $ 65 Other operation and maintenance expense for Power Delivery increased by $57 million; however, excluding an increase of $11 million primarily related to bad debt and administrative expenses that are deferred and recoverable in Default Electricity Supply Revenue, Other Operation and Maintenance expense increased by $46 million. The $46 million increase was primarily due to: An increase of $33 million in emergency restoration costs primarily due to severe storms in February, July and August 2010. An increase of $17 million in estimated environmental remediation costs due to (i) the establishment of a reserve in the amount of $13 million relating to a possible discharge of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at the Benning Road transmission and distribution facility owned by Pepco, and (ii) a $4 million accrual in 2010 for future costs relating to a 1999 oil release at the Indian River generating facility then owned by DPL, as further discussed under the headings Benning Road Site and Indian River Oil Release, respectively, in Note (17), Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. An increase of $14 million primarily due to higher tree trimming, preventative and corrective maintenance costs. An increase of $5 million primarily due to system support and customer support service costs. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $17 million in employee related costs, primarily due to lower pension and other postretirement benefit expenses. A decrease of $9 million primarily due to Pepco deferral of (i) February 2010 severe winter storm costs, and (ii) distribution rate case costs, which in each case originally had been charged to Other Operation and Maintenance expense. These deferrals were recorded in accordance with a MPSC rate order issued in August 2010 and a DCPSC rate order issued in February 2010, respectively, authorizing the establishment of regulatory assets for the recovery of these costs. 47 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Other Operation and Maintenance expense for Pepco Energy Services increased $5 million, primarily due to increases of $8 million in power plant operating costs and $3 million due to the repair cost of a distribution system pipe leak; partially offset by a decrease of $5 million in bad debt expense. Restructuring Charge With the ongoing wind down of the retail energy supply business of Pepco Energy Services and the disposition of Conectiv Energy, PHI is repositioning itself as a regulated transmission and distribution company. In connection with this repositioning, PHI commenced a comprehensive organizational review in the second quarter of 2010 to identify opportunities to streamline the organization and to achieve certain reductions in corporate overhead costs that are allocated to its operating segments. This review has resulted in the adoption of a restructuring plan. PHI began implementing the plan during the third quarter, identifying 164 employee positions that were eliminated during the fourth quarter of 2010. The plan also focuses on identifying additional cost reduction opportunities through process improvements and operational efficiencies. PHI currently estimates that the implementation of the plan will result in an annual reduction of approximately $28 million in corporate overhead costs. In connection with the plan, PHI recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, related to severance, pension, and health and welfare benefits to be provided to terminated employees. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and Amortization expense increased by $44 million to $393 million in 2010 from $349 million in 2009 primarily due to: An increase of $12 million in amortization of regulatory assets primarily due to the EmPower Maryland surcharge that became effective in March 2010 (which is substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue). An increase of $10 million due to utility plant additions. An increase of $8 million due to higher amortization by ACE of stranded costs, primarily the result of higher revenue due to increases in sales (partially offset in Default Electricity Supply Revenue). An increase of $4 million primarily due to the recognition of asset retirement obligations associated with Pepco Energy Services generating facilities scheduled for deactivation in May 2012. An increase of $2 million in the amortization of Demand Side Management deferred expenses. Other Taxes Other Taxes increased by $66 million to $434 million in 2010 from $368 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to increased pass throughs experienced by Power Delivery (which are substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue) primarily resulting from utility tax rate increases imposed by Montgomery County, Maryland. Deferred Electric Service Costs Deferred Electric Service Costs, which relate only to ACE, represent (i) the over or under recovery of electricity costs incurred by ACE to fulfill its Default Electricity Supply obligation and (ii) the over or under recovery of New Jersey Societal Benefit Program costs incurred by ACE. The cost of electricity 48 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS purchased is reported under Fuel and Purchased Energy and the corresponding revenue is reported under Default Electricity Supply Revenue. The cost of New Jersey Societal Benefit Programs is reported under Other Operation and Maintenance and the corresponding revenue is reported under Regulated T&D Electric Revenue. Deferred Electric Service Costs increased by $53 million, to an expense reduction of $108 million in 2010 as compared to an expense reduction of $161 million in 2009, primarily due to an increase in deferred electricity expense as a result of lower electricity supply costs and higher Default Electricity Supply Revenue rates. Effect of Pepco Divestiture Related Claims District of Columbia Divestiture Case The DCPSC on May 18, 2010 issued an order addressing all of the outstanding issues relating to Pepcos obligation to share with its District of Columbia customers the net proceeds realized by Pepco from the sale of its generation related assets in 2000. This order disallowed certain items that Pepco had included in the costs it deducted in calculating the net proceeds of the sale. The disallowance of these costs, together with interest, increased the aggregate amount Pepco is required to distribute to customers by approximately $11 million. While Pepco has filed an appeal of the DCPSCs decision with the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, in view of the DCPSC order, PHI recognized a pre tax expense of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The appeal is still pending. Settlement of Mirant Bankruptcy Claims In March 2009, the DCPSC approved an allocation between Pepco and its District of Columbia customers of the District of Columbia portion of the Mirant bankruptcy settlement proceeds remaining after the transfer of the Panda PPA. As a result, Pepco recorded a pre tax gain of $14 million in the first quarter of 2009 reflecting the District of Columbia proceeds retained by Pepco. In July 2009, the MPSC approved an allocation between Pepco and its Maryland customers of the Maryland portion of the Mirant bankruptcy settlement proceeds. As a result, Pepco recorded a pre tax gain of $26 million in the third quarter of 2009 reflecting the Maryland proceeds retained by Pepco. Other Income (Expenses) Other Expenses (which are net of Other Income) increased by $153 million primarily due to a $189 million loss on extinguishment of debt that was recorded in 2010 as further discussed below, partially offset by lower interest expense of $34 million. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt In 2010, PHI purchased or redeemed senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1,194 million. In connection with these transactions, PHI recorded a pre tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $189 million in 2010, $174 million which was attributable to the retirement of the debt and $15 million which related to the acceleration of losses on treasury rate lock transactions associated with debt that was retired. For a further discussion of these transactions, see Note (11), Debt, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI, set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 49 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Income Tax Expense PHIs consolidated effective tax rates from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were 7.3% and 31.8%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily due to two factors. The first is the recording of current state tax benefits resulting from the restructuring of certain PHI subsidiaries which subjected PHI to state income taxes in new jurisdictions. On April 1, 2010, as part of an ongoing effort to simplify PHIs organizational structure, certain of PHIs subsidiaries were converted from corporations to single member limited liability companies. In addition to increased organizational flexibility and reduced administrative costs, converting these entities to limited liability companies allows PHI to include income or losses in the former corporations in a single state income tax return, thus increasing the utilization of state income tax attributes. As a result of inclusions of income or losses in a single state return as discussed above, PHI recorded an $8 million benefit by reversing a valuation allowance on certain state net operating losses and an additional benefit of $6 million resulting from changes to certain state deferred tax benefits. The second factor is the reversal of accrued interest on uncertain and effectively settled tax positions resulting from final settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of certain open tax years. In November 2010, PHI reached final settlement with the IRS with respect to its federal tax returns for the years 1996 to 2002 for all issues except its cross border energy lease investments. In connection with the settlement, PHI reallocated certain amounts on deposit with the IRS since 2006 among liabilities in the settlement years and subsequent years. In light of the settlement and reallocations, PHI has recalculated the estimated interest due for the tax years 1996 to 2002. The revised estimate has resulted in the reversal of $15 million of previously accrued estimated interest due to the IRS. This reversal has been recorded as an income tax benefit in 2010, and is subject to adjustment when the IRS finalizes its calculation of the amount due. Discontinued Operations For the year ended December 31, 2010, the $107 million loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, consists of after tax income from operations of $6 million and after tax net losses of $113 million from dispositions of assets and businesses. 50 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS The following results of operations discussion is for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. All amounts in the tables (except sales and customers) are in millions of dollars. Continuing Operations Operating Revenue A detail of the components of PHIs consolidated operating revenue is as follows: 2009 2008 Change Power Delivery $ 4,980 $ 5,488 $ (508 ) Pepco Energy Services 2,383 2,648 (265 ) Other Non Regulated 51 (60 ) 111 Corporate and Other (12 ) (17 ) 5 Total Operating Revenue $ 7,402 $ 8,059 $ (657 ) Power Delivery Business The following table categorizes Power Deliverys operating revenue by type of revenue. 2009 2008 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 1,653 $ 1,690 $ (37 ) Default Electricity Supply Revenue 2,990 3,413 (423 ) Other Electric Revenue 69 67 2 Total Electric Operating Revenue 4,712 5,170 (458 ) Regulated Gas Revenue 228 204 24 Other Gas Revenue 40 114 (74 ) Total Gas Operating Revenue 268 318 (50 ) Total Power Delivery Operating Revenue $ 4,980 $ 5,488 $ (508 ) Regulated Transmission and Distribution (T&D) Electric Revenue includes revenue from the distribution of electricity, including the distribution of Default Electricity Supply, by PHIs utility subsidiaries to customers within their service territories at regulated rates. Regulated T&D Electric Revenue also includes transmission service revenue that PHIs utility subsidiaries receive as transmission owners from the PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM) at rates regulated by FERC. Default Electricity Supply Revenue is the revenue received from the supply of electricity by PHIs utility subsidiaries at regulated rates to retail customers who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier. Depending on the jurisdiction, Default Electricity Supply is also known as Standard Offer Service or Basic Generation Service (BGS). The costs related to Default Electricity Supply are included in Fuel and Purchased Energy. Default Electricity Supply Revenue also includes revenue from Transition Bond Charges that ACE receives, and pays to Atlantic City Electric Transition Funding LLC (ACE Funding), to fund the principal and interest payments on Transition Bonds issued by ACE Funding and revenue in the form of transmission enhancement credits that PHI utility subsidiaries receive as transmission owners from PJM for approved regional transmission expansion plan costs (Transmission Enhancement Credits). Other Electric Revenue includes work and services performed on behalf of customers, including other utilities, which is generally not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of pole attachments, late payment fees, and collection fees. 51 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Regulated Gas Revenue includes the revenue DPL receives from on system natural gas delivered sales and the transportation of natural gas for customers within its service territory at regulated rates. Other Gas Revenue consists of DPLs off system natural gas sales and the short term release of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity not needed to serve customers. Off system sales are made possible when low demand for natural gas by regulated customers creates excess pipeline capacity. Regulated T&D Electric 2009 2008 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue Residential $ 596 $ 593 $ 3 Commercial and industrial 804 786 18 Other 253 311 (58 ) Total Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 1,653 $ 1,690 $ (37 ) Other Regulated T&D Electric Revenue consists primarily of: (i) transmission service revenue and (ii) revenue from the resale by Pepco in the PJM RTO market of energy and capacity purchased under the Panda PPA prior to the transfer of the Panda PPA to an unaffiliated third party in September 2008. 2009 2008 Change Regulated T&D Electric Sales (GWh) Residential 16,871 17,186 (315 ) Commercial and industrial 31,570 32,520 (950 ) Other 261 261 Total Regulated T&D Electric Sales 48,702 49,967 (1,265 ) 2009 2008 Change Regulated T&D Electric Customers (in thousands) Residential 1,623 1,612 11 Commercial and industrial 198 198 Other 2 2 Total Regulated T&D Electric Customers 1,823 1,812 11 Regulated T&D Electric Revenue decreased by $37 million primarily due to: A decrease of $53 million in Other Regulated T&D Electric Revenue (which is matched by a corresponding decrease in Fuel and Purchased Energy) due to the absence of revenues from the resale of energy and capacity purchased under the Panda PPA after September 2008. A decrease of $12 million due to lower non weather related customer usage. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $16 million due to a distribution rate increase (which is substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Deferred Electric Service Costs) as part of a higher New Jersey Societal Benefit Charge that became effective in June 2008. 52 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS An increase of $15 million due to higher pass through revenue (which is substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Other Taxes) primarily the result of increases in utility taxes that are collected on behalf of taxing jurisdictions. Default Electricity Supply 2009 2008 Change Default Electricity Supply Revenue Residential $ 1,915 $ 1,882 $ 33 Commercial and industrial 915 1,200 (285 ) Other 160 331 (171 ) Total Default Electricity Supply Revenue $ 2,990 $ 3,413 $ (423 ) Other Default Electricity Supply Revenue consists primarily of revenue from the resale by ACE in the PJM RTO market of energy and capacity purchased under contracts with unaffiliated NUGs. 2009 2008 Change Default Electricity Supply Sales (GWh) Residential 16,274 16,621 (347 ) Commercial and industrial 8,470 10,204 (1,734 ) Other 101 101 Total Default Electricity Supply Sales 24,845 26,926 (2,081 ) 2009 2008 Change Default Electricity Supply Customers (in thousands) Residential 1,572 1,572 Commercial and industrial 159 167 (8 ) Other 2 2 Total Default Electricity Supply Customers 1,733 1,741 (8 ) Default Electricity Supply Revenue decreased by $423 million primarily due to: A decrease of $175 million in wholesale energy revenues due to lower market prices for the sale of electricity purchased from NUGs. A decrease of $167 million due to lower sales, primarily the result of commercial customer migration to competitive suppliers. A decrease of $49 million due to lower non weather related customer usage. A decrease of $33 million due to lower sales as a result of milder weather primarily during the 2009 summer months as compared to 2008. 53 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS The decrease in total Default Electricity Supply Revenue includes a decrease of $8 million in unbilled revenue attributable to ACEs BGS. Under the BGS terms approved by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU), ACE is entitled to recover from its customers all of its costs of providing BGS. If the costs of providing BGS exceed the BGS revenue, then the excess costs are deferred in Deferred Electric Service Costs. ACEs BGS unbilled revenue is not included in the deferral calculation, and therefore has an impact on the results of operations in the period during which it is accrued. While the change in the amount of unbilled revenue from year to year typically is not significant, for the year ended December 31, 2009, BGS unbilled revenue decreased by $8 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, which resulted in a $5 million decrease in PHIs net income. The decrease was due to increased customer migration and lower customer usage during the unbilled revenue period at the end of 2009 as compared to the corresponding period in 2008. Regulated Gas 2009 2008 Change Regulated Gas Revenue Residential $ 139 $ 121 $ 18 Commercial and industrial 81 75 6 Transportation and other 8 8 Total Regulated Gas Revenue $ 228 $ 204 $ 24 2009 2008 Change Regulated Gas Sales (billion cubic feet) Residential 8 7 1 Commercial and industrial 5 6 (1 ) Transportation and other 6 7 (1 ) Total Regulated Gas Sales 19 20 (1 ) 2009 2008 Change Regulated Gas Customers (in thousands) Residential 113 113 Commercial and industrial 10 9 1 Transportation and other Total Regulated Gas Customers 123 122 1 Regulated Gas Revenue increased by $24 million primarily due to: An increase of $15 million due to the Gas Cost Rate increase effective November 2008, partially offset by rate decreases in March 2009 and November 2009. An increase of $14 million (which is offset by a corresponding increase in Fuel and Purchased Energy) associated with the recognition of the unbilled portion of Gas Cost Rate revenue in 2009 which was not previously recognized. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $5 million due to lower non weather related customer usage. 54 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS A decrease of $4 million due to lower sales as result of warmer weather during the fourth quarter of 2009 as compared to the corresponding period in 2008. Other Gas Revenue Other Gas Revenue decreased by $74 million primarily due to lower revenue from off system sales resulting from: A decrease of $67 million due to lower market prices. A decrease of $9 million due to lower demand from electric generators and natural gas marketers. Pepco Energy Services Pepco Energy Services operating revenue decreased $265 million primarily due to: A decrease of $170 million due to lower volumes of retail electric load served as a result of the expiration of existing retail contracts. A decrease of $72 million due to lower construction activities as a result of reduced high voltage construction and maintenance projects. A decrease of $20 million due to lower retail natural gas prices partially offset by higher customer load as a result of customer acquisitions. A decrease of $3 million due to lower generation output as a result of milder weather and lower overall load levels for the PJM RTO control area. Other Non Regulated Other Non Regulated revenues increased by $111 million from a $60 million loss in 2008 to a $51 million gain in 2009. This was primarily the result of a non cash charge of $124 million that was recorded in the quarter ended June 30, 2008 as a result of revised assumptions regarding the estimated timing of tax benefits from cross border energy lease investments of Potomac Capital Investment Corporation and its subsidiaries (PCI). In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidance on leases (Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 840), the charge was recorded as a reduction to lease revenue from these transactions, which is included in Other Non Regulated revenues. Operating Expenses Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales A detail of PHIs consolidated Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales is as follows: 2009 2008 Change Power Delivery $ 3,243 $ 3,578 $ (335 ) Pepco Energy Services 2,179 2,489 (310 ) Corporate and Other (7 ) (13 ) 6 Total $ 5,415 $ 6,054 $ (639 ) 55 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Power Delivery Business Power Deliverys Fuel and Purchased Energy (other than expense associated with Regulated Gas Revenue and Other Gas revenue) consists of the cost of electricity purchased by its utility subsidiaries to fulfill their respective Default Electricity Supply obligations and, as such, is recoverable from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders. Fuel and Purchased Energy expense decreased by $335 million primarily due to: A decrease of $236 million primarily due to commercial customer migration to competitive suppliers. A decrease of $73 million in the cost of natural gas purchases for off systems sales, the result of lower average natural gas prices and volumes purchased. A decrease of $53 million (which is matched by a corresponding decrease in Other Regulated T&D Electric Revenue) due to the transfer of the Panda PPA. A decrease of $33 million due to lower electricity sales as a result of milder weather primarily during the 2009 summer months as compared to 2008. A decrease of $30 million in the cost of natural gas purchases for system sales, the result of lower average natural gas prices and volumes purchased. A decrease of $23 million due to lower average electricity costs under Default Electricity Supply contracts. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $63 million due to a higher rate of recovery of electricity supply costs resulting in a decrease in the Default Electricity Supply deferral balance. An increase of $43 million from the settlement of financial hedges entered into as part of DPLs hedge program for regulated natural gas. An increase of $12 million due to a higher rate of recovery of natural gas supply costs primarily as a result of recognizing the unbilled portion of Gas Cost Rate revenue in 2009, as discussed under Regulated Gas Revenue. Pepco Energy Services Pepco Energy Services Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales decreased $310 million primarily due to: A decrease of $212 million due to lower volumes of electricity purchased to serve decreased retail customer load as the result of the continuing expiration of existing retail contracts. A decrease of $45 million due to lower wholesale natural gas prices partially offset by higher retail customer load as the result of customer acquisitions. A decrease of $42 million due to lower construction activities as a result of reduced high voltage construction and maintenance projects. A decrease of $11 million due to lower generation output due to milder weather and lower overall load levels for the PJM control area. 56 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Other Operation and Maintenance A detail of PHIs other operation and maintenance expense is as follows: 2009 2008 Change Power Delivery $ 752 $ 702 $ 50 Pepco Energy Services 90 87 3 Other Non Regulated 2 2 Corporate and Other (25 ) (16 ) (9 ) Total $ 819 $ 775 $ 44 Other Operation and Maintenance expense for Power Delivery increased by $50 million; however, excluding a decrease of $5 million primarily related to administrative expenses that are deferred and recoverable in Default Electricity Supply Revenue, Other Operation and Maintenance expense increased by $55 million. The $55 million increase was primarily due to: An increase of $39 million in employee related costs, primarily due to higher pension and other postretirement benefit expenses. An increase of $13 million primarily due to higher preventative and corrective maintenance, and emergency restoration costs. An increase of $4 million in regulatory expenses primarily incurred in connection with the District of Columbia distribution rate case. An increase of $3 million due to higher non deferrable bad debt expenses. During 2008, PHI recorded adjustments, on a consolidated basis, to correct errors in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses for prior periods dating back to February 2005 during which (i) customer late payment fees were incorrectly recognized and (ii) stock based compensation expense related to certain restricted stock awards granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan was understated. The late payment fees and stock based compensation adjustments resulted in increases in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 of $6 million and $9 million, respectively. These adjustments were not considered material either individually or in the aggregate. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and Amortization expense increased by $11 million to $349 million in 2009 from $338 million in 2008 primarily due to an increase of $14 million due to utility plant additions and $4 million due to the accelerated depreciation of Pepco Energy Services generating facilities that will be decommissioned in 2012, partially offset by a decrease of $7 million due to lower amortization by ACE of stranded costs primarily as the result of lower revenue due to decreases in the Market Transition Charge Tax rate in October 2009 and October 2008 (partially offset in Default Electricity Supply Revenue). Other Taxes Other Taxes increased by $13 million to $368 million in 2009 from $355 million in 2008. The increase was primarily due to increased pass throughs experienced by Power Delivery (which are substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue) resulting from rate increases in utility taxes imposed by the taxing jurisdictions. 57 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Deferred Electric Service Costs Deferred Electric Service Costs, which relate only to ACE, decreased by $152 million, to an expense reduction of $161 million in 2009 as compared to an expense reduction of $9 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to: A decrease of $186 million due to a lower rate of recovery of costs from the resale in the PJM RTO market of energy and capacity purchased under the NUG contracts. The decrease was partially offset by: An increase of $15 million due to a higher rate of recovery through customer rates of deferred energy supply costs for Default Electricity Supply (included in Default Electricity Supply Revenue). An increase of $13 million due to a higher rate of recovery through customer rates of New Jersey Societal Benefit program costs (included in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue). An increase of $5 million due to a higher rate of recovery through customer rates of deferred transmission costs for Default Electricity Supply (included in Default Electricity Supply Revenue). Effect of Settlement of Mirant Bankruptcy Claims In September 2008, Pepco transferred the Panda PPA to an unaffiliated third party. In March 2009, the DCPSC approved an allocation between Pepco and its District of Columbia customers of the District of Columbia portion of the Mirant bankruptcy settlement proceeds remaining after the transfer of the Panda PPA. As a result, Pepco recorded a pre tax gain of $14 million reflecting the District of Columbia proceeds retained by Pepco. In July 2009, the MPSC approved an allocation between Pepco and its Maryland customers of the Maryland portion of the Mirant bankruptcy settlement proceeds remaining after the transfer of the Panda PPA. As a result, Pepco recorded a pre tax gain of $26 million reflecting the Maryland proceeds retained by Pepco. Gain on Sale of Assets Gain on Sale of Assets decreased by $3 million in 2009 due to a $3 million gain on the sale of the Virginia retail electric distribution and wholesale transmission assets in January 2008. Other Income (Expenses) Other Expenses (which are net of Other Income) increased by $45 million to a net expense of $321 million in 2009 from a net expense of $276 million in 2008, primarily due to an increase in interest expense. The increase in interest expense was due to a $33 million increase in interest expense on long term debt as the result of a higher amount of outstanding debt, and an increase of $13 million in interest expense on short term debt due primarily to the Pepco Energy Services credit intermediation agreement, as described below under the heading Capital Resources and Liquidity Collateral Requirements of Pepco Energy Services. Income Tax Expense PHIs consolidated effective tax rates from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were 31.8% and 33.0%, respectively. The decrease in the rate primarily resulted from a refund of $6 million (after tax) of state income taxes and the establishment of a state tax benefit carryforward of $7 million (after tax) related to a change in the tax reporting for the disposition of certain assets in prior years, and from the 2008 charge related to the cross border energy lease investments described in Note (17), Commitments and Contingencies, and corresponding state tax benefits related to the charge. 58 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Discontinued Operations Income from Discontinued Operations, net of income taxes, decreased by $105 million to $12 million in 2009 from $117 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower Conectiv Energy earnings as the result of (i) a $79 million decrease resulting from significantly reduced spark (natural gas) spreads, dark (coal) spreads and lower run time, (ii) a $63 million decrease primarily related to economic fuel hedges that were favorable in 2008 due to rising fuel prices and unfavorable in 2009 due to falling fuel prices; partially offset by (iii) a $39 million increase due to higher capacity margins caused primarily by higher Reliability Pricing Model clearing prices. Capital Resources and Liquidity This section discusses Pepco Holdings working capital, cash flow activity, capital requirements and other uses and sources of capital. Working Capital At December 31, 2010, Pepco Holdings current assets on a consolidated basis totaled $1.8 billion and its current liabilities totaled $1.8 billion. PHI expects the working capital deficit at December 31, 2010 to be funded during 2011 in part through cash flow from operations. Additional working capital will be provided by anticipated reductions in collateral requirements due to the ongoing wind down of the Pepco Energy Services retail energy supply business and the completion of the disposition of the Conectiv Energy business. At December 31, 2009, Pepco Holdings current assets on a consolidated basis totaled $1.9 billion and its current liabilities totaled $2.3 billion. The increase in working capital from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010 is primarily due to a reduction in the current portion of long term debt. At December 31, 2010, Pepco Holdings cash and current cash equivalents totaled $21 million, of which $1 million is reflected on the balance sheet in Conectiv Energy assets held for sale, and the balance was held as cash and uncollected funds. Current restricted cash equivalents (cash that is available to be used only for designated purposes) totaled $11 million. At December 31, 2009, Pepco Holdings cash and current cash equivalents totaled $46 million, of which $2 million is reflected on the balance sheet in Conectiv Energy assets held for sale, and its current restricted cash equivalents totaled $11 million.

The aggregate borrowing limit under this credit facility is $1.5 billion, all or any portion of which may be used to obtain loans or to issue letters of credit. PHIs credit limit under the facility is $875 million. The credit limit of each of Pepco, DPL and ACE is the lesser of $500 million and the maximum amount of debt the company is permitted to have outstanding by its regulatory authorities, except that the aggregate amount of credit used by Pepco, DPL and ACE at any given time collectively may not exceed $625 million. The interest rate payable by each company on utilized funds is, at the borrowing companys election, (i) the greater of the prevailing prime rate and the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, or (ii) the prevailing Eurodollar rate, plus a margin that varies according to the credit rating of the borrower. The facility also includes a swingline loan sub facility pursuant to which each company may make same day borrowings in an aggregate amount not to exceed $150 million. Any swingline loan must be repaid by the borrower within seven days of receipt thereof. The facility commitment expiration date is May 5, 2012, with each company having the right to elect to have 100% of the principal balance of the loans outstanding on the expiration date continued as non revolving term loans for a period of one year from such expiration date. The facility is intended to serve primarily as a source of liquidity to support the commercial paper programs of the respective companies. The companies also are permitted to use the facility to borrow funds for general corporate purposes and issue letters of credit. In order for a borrower to use the facility, certain representations and warranties must be true and correct, and the borrower must be in compliance with specified covenants, including (i) the requirement that each borrowing company maintain a ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization of 65% or less, computed in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement, which calculation excludes from the definition of total indebtedness certain trust preferred securities and deferrable interest subordinated debt (not to exceed 15% of total capitalization), (ii) a restriction on sales or other dispositions of assets, other than certain sales and dispositions, and (iii) a restriction on the incurrence of liens on the assets of a borrower or any of its significant subsidiaries other than permitted liens. The absence of a material adverse change in the borrowers business, property, and results of operations or financial condition is not a condition to the availability of credit under the facility. The facility does not include any rating triggers. On October 15, 2010, a $400 million unsecured credit facility maintained by PHI expired. To replace this facility, PHI, on October 27, 2010, entered into two bi lateral 364 day unsecured credit agreements totaling $200 million. Under each of the credit agreements, PHI has access to revolving and floating rate loans over the terms of the agreements. Neither agreement provides for the issuance of letters of credit. The interest rate payable on funds borrowed is at PHIs election, based on either (a) the prevailing Eurodollar rate plus 2.0% or (b) the highest of (i) the prevailing prime rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% or (iii) the one month Eurodollar rate plus 1.0%, plus a margin of 1.0%. In order to obtain loans under either of the agreements, PHI must be in compliance with the same covenants and conditions that it is required to satisfy for utilization of its existing $1.5 billion credit facility. The absence of a material adverse change in PHIs business, property, and results of operations or financial condition is not a condition to the availability of credit under either agreement. Neither agreement includes any rating triggers. 60 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS The $1.5 billion credit facility and the two bi lateral credit agreements are referred to herein collectively as PHIs primary credit facilities. As of December 31, 2010, each borrower was in compliance with the covenants of each of the primary credit facilities. On November 2, 2010, PHIs $50 million bi lateral credit agreement with The Bank of Nova Scotia expired. Both the $400 million PHI facility that expired in October 2010 and this agreement were established to provide additional liquidity and collateral support for Pepco Energy Services retail energy supply business and for the operations of Conectiv Energy. Based on the progress toward winding down the retail energy supply business and disposing of the Conectiv Energy segment, the level of liquidity and collateral needed to support these businesses has decreased. As a result, PHI has been able to reduce the total amount of its credit facility needs by $250 million. Cash and Credit Facilities Available as of December 31, 2010 ConsolidatedPHI PHI Parent UtilitySubsidiaries (millions of dollars) Credit Facilities (Total Capacity) $ 1,700 $ 1,075 $ 625 Less: Letters of Credit issued 122 117 5 Commercial Paper outstanding 388 230 158 Remaining Credit Facilities Available 1,190 728 462 Cash Invested in Money Market Funds (a) Total Cash and Credit Facilities Available $ 1,190 $ 728 $ 462 (a) Cash and cash equivalents reported on the balance sheet total $20 million which was all held in cash and uncollected funds. Collateral Requirements At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the amount of cash, plus borrowing capacity under the primary credit facilities available to meet the future liquidity needs of Pepco Energy Services and Conectiv Energy totaled $728 million and $820 million, respectively. Collateral Requirements of Pepco Energy Services In conducting its retail energy supply business, Pepco Energy Services, during periods of declining energy prices, has been exposed to the asymmetrical risk of having to post collateral under its wholesale purchase contracts without receiving a corresponding amount of collateral from its retail customers. To partially address these asymmetrical collateral obligations, Pepco Energy Services, in the first quarter of 2009, entered into a credit intermediation arrangement with Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. (MSCG). Under this arrangement, MSCG, in consideration for the payment to MSCG of certain fees, (i) assumed by novation, the electricity purchase obligations of Pepco Energy Services in years 2009 through 2011 under several wholesale purchase contracts, and (ii) agreed to supply electricity to Pepco Energy Services on the same terms as the novated transactions, but without imposing on Pepco Energy Services any obligation to post collateral based on changes in electricity prices. The upfront fees incurred by Pepco Energy Services in 2009 in the amount of $25 million are being amortized into expense in declining amounts over the life of the arrangement based on the fair value of the underlying contracts at the time of the novation. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, approximately $8 million and $16 million, respectively, of the fees have been amortized and reflected in interest expense. As the retail electric and natural gas supply businesses are wound down, Pepco Energy Services collateral requirements will be further reduced. 61 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS In relation to the wind down of its retail energy supply business, Pepco Energy Services in the ordinary course of business has entered into various contracts to buy and sell electricity, fuels and related products, including derivative instruments, designed to reduce its financial exposure to changes in the value of its assets and obligations due to energy price fluctuations. These contracts also typically have collateral requirements. Depending on the contract terms, the collateral required to be posted by Pepco Energy Services can be of varying forms, including cash and letters of credit. As of December 31, 2010, Pepco Energy Services had posted net cash collateral of $117 million and letters of credit of $113 million. At December 31, 2009, Pepco Energy Services had posted net cash collateral of $123 million and letters of credit of $157 million. Remaining Collateral Requirements of Conectiv Energy Depending on the contract terms, the collateral required to be posted by Conectiv Energy is of varying forms, including cash and letters of credit. As of December 31, 2010, Conectiv Energy had posted net cash collateral of $104 million and there were no outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2009, Conectiv Energy had posted net cash collateral of $240 million and letters of credit of $22 million. On January 6, 2011, as part of its ongoing divestiture efforts, Conectiv Energy entered into a financial transaction with a third party under which Conectiv Energy transferred its remaining portfolio of derivatives, including financially settled natural gas and electric power transactions for all remaining periods from February 1, 2011 forward. In connection with the closing of the transaction, Conectiv Energy paid the third party $82 million, primarily representing the fair value of the derivative instruments at February 1, 2011 and an administrative fee of approximately $2 million that will be expensed in the first quarter of 2011. No additional material gain or loss will be recognized as a result of this transaction as the derivatives were previously marked to fair value through earnings in 2010. Approximately $68 million of collateral was returned to Conectiv Energy upon the closing of the transaction in January 2011. Approximately $11 million of the remaining $36 million in outstanding collateral will be returned to Conectiv Energy in connection with this transaction upon the novation of several over the counter transactions. All of the remaining posted cash collateral, other than the $11 million referred to above, is held by the PJM and ISO New England Inc. regional transmission organizations and will be returned within the next several months upon completion of a reconciliation process. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans In 2008, the pension and other postretirement benefit plans maintained by PHI experienced significant declines in the fair value of plan assets, which has resulted in increased pension and other postretirement benefit costs in 2009 and 2010 and increased plan funding requirements. Based on the results of the 2010 actuarial valuation, PHIs net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs were approximately $116 million in 2010 versus $149 million in 2009. The current estimate of benefit cost for 2011 is $107 million. The utility subsidiaries are responsible for substantially all of the total PHI net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs. Approximately 30% of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs are capitalized. PHI estimates that its net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit expense will be approximately $75 million in 2011, as compared to $81 million in 2010 and $103 million in 2009. 62 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Pension benefits are provided under PHIs defined benefit pension plan (the PHI Retirement Plan), a non contributory retirement plan that covers substantially all employees of Pepco, DPL and ACE and certain employees of other PHI subsidiaries. PHIs funding policy with regard to the PHI Retirement Plan is to maintain a funding level that is at least equal to the funding target as defined under the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The funding target under the Pension Protection Act is an amount that is being phased in over time. The funding target was 96% of the accrued liability for 2010 and is 100% of the accrued liability for 2011. During 2010, PHI Service Company made discretionary tax deductible contributions totaling $100 million to the PHI Retirement Plan, which brought plan assets to at least the funding target level for 2010 under the Pension Protection Act. Pepco, ACE and DPL did not make contributions to the pension plan in 2010. In 2009, PHI made discretionary tax deductible contributions totaling $300 million to the PHI Retirement Plan, which brought plan assets to at least the funding target level for 2009 under the Pension Protection Act. Of this amount, $240 million was contributed through tax deductible contributions from Pepco, ACE and DPL in the amounts of $170 million, $60 million and $10 million, respectively. The remaining $60 million contribution was made through tax deductible contributions from PHI Service Company. Under the Pension Protection Act, if a plan incurs a funding shortfall in the preceding plan year, there can be required minimum quarterly contributions in the current and following plan years. PHI satisfied the minimum required contribution rules in 2010, 2009 and 2008 and does not expect to have any required contributions in 2011. Although PHI projects there will be no minimum funding requirement under the Pension Protection Act guidelines in 2011, PHI currently estimates it may make discretionary tax deductible contributions in 2011 of up to $150 million to bring the PHI Retirement Plan assets to at least the funding target level for 2011 under the Pension Protection Act. For additional discussion of PHIs Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, see Note (10), Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI, set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Cash Flow Activity PHIs cash flows during 2010, 2009, and 2008 are summarized below: Cash (Use) Source 2010 2009 2008 (millions of dollars) Operating Activities $ 813 $ 606 $ 413 Investing Activities 718 (860 ) (714 ) Financing Activities (1,556 ) (84 ) 630 Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (25 ) $ (338 ) $ 329 63 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Operating Activities Cash flows from operating activities during 2010, 2009, and 2008 are summarized below: Cash Source (Use) 2010 2009 2008 (millions of dollars) Net Income from continuing operations $ 139 $ 223 $ 183 Non cash adjustments to net income 349 260 390 Pension contributions (100 ) (300 ) Changes in cash collateral related to derivative activities 13 24 (138 ) Changes in other assets and liabilities 164 296 22 Changes in Conectiv Energy net assets held for sale 248 103 (44 ) Net cash from operating activities $ 813 $ 606 $ 413 Net cash from operating activities was $207 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. Portions of the increase are attributable to a 2010 decrease in pension plan contributions compared to 2009 and a decrease in regulatory liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2010 as the result of a lower rate of recovery by ACE of costs associated with energy and capacity purchased under the NUG contracts. Changes in cash from Conectiv Energy assets held for sale reflect a net decrease in Conectiv Energy assets and liabilities included in discontinued operations, including a decrease in collateral requirements as a result of the liquidation of derivative instruments as further described in Note (20), Discontinued Operations. Net cash from operating activities was $193 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. A portion of this increase is attributable to the release from restricted cash of $102 million related to the Mirant settlement and the 2009 receipt of a Federal income tax refund from the IRS of $138 million associated with the carryback of a net operating loss for tax reporting purposes that reflected, among other things, significant tax deductions related to accelerated depreciation, the pension plan contributions paid in 2009 (which were deductible for 2008) and the cumulative effect of adopting a new method of tax reporting for certain repairs. PHI also experienced reduced cash requirements related to purchases of inventory (associated with lower natural gas and electric prices). Offsetting these increases were the pension plan contributions of $300 million made during 2009. The change in Conectiv Energy net assets held for sale included a decrease of $99 million in collateral requirements between 2008 and 2009. Net cash from operating activities in 2008 included a non cash charge taken on the cross border energy lease investments, and additional collateral requirements of $138 million primarily related to Pepco Energy Services retail energy supply business. 64 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Investing Activities Cash flows used by investing activities during 2010, 2009, and 2008 are summarized below: Cash (Use) Source 2010 2009 2008 (millions of dollars) Investment in property, plant and equipment $ (802 ) $ (664 ) $ (643 ) DOE capital reimbursement awards received 13 Proceeds from sale of Conectiv Energy wholesale power generation business 1,640 Proceeds from sale of assets 3 4 56 Net other investing activities 2 11 Investment in property, plant and equipment associated with Conectiv Energy assets held for sale (138 ) (200 ) (138 ) Net cash from (used by) investing activities $ 718 $ (860 ) $ (714 ) Net cash from investing activities increased $1,578 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. The increase was due primarily to the July 1, 2010 sale of the Conectiv Energy wholesale power generation business offset by a $143 million increase in Power Delivery capital expenditures primarily attributable to capital costs associated with transmission plant investment and PHIs Blueprint for the Future initiatives. Net cash used by investing activities increased by $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. The increase was due primarily to an $83 million increase in capital expenditures, of which $62 million was attributable to Conectiv Energy assets held for sale and $35 million was attributable to Power Delivery, partially offset by a decrease in Pepco Energy Services capital expenditures. The increase in Conectiv Energy capital expenditures was primarily due to the construction of new generating facilities. The increase in Power Delivery capital expenditures was primarily attributable to capital costs associated with the Mid Atlantic Power Pathway (MAPP) and Blueprint for the Future projects. The increase in cash used by investing activities also reflected a $52 million reduction in cash proceeds from the sale of other assets, primarily due to the receipt by DPL in 2008 of cash proceeds in the amount of $54 million from the sale of its retail electric distribution and wholesale electric transmission assets in Virginia. 65 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Financing Activities Cash flows used by financing activities during 2010, 2009 and 2008 are summarized below. Cash (Use) Source 2010 2009 2008 (millions of dollars) Dividends paid on common and preferred stock $ (241 ) $ (238 ) $ (222 ) Common stock issued for the Dividend Reinvestment Plan and employee related compensation 47 49 51 Issuance of common stock 265 Issuances of long term debt 383 110 1,150 Reacquisition of long term debt (1,726 ) (83 ) (590 ) Issuances (repayments) of short term debt, net 4 65 26 Cost of issuances (7 ) (4 ) (30 ) Net other financing activities (6 ) 10 (21 ) Net financing activities associated with Conectiv Energy assets held for sale (10 ) 7 1 Net cash (used by) provided by financing activities $ (1,556 ) $ (84 ) $ 630 Net cash related to financing activities decreased $1,472 million for the year ended 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to the retirement of long term debt using the proceeds from the sale of the Conectiv Energy wholesale power generation business. Net cash from financing activities decreased $714 million for the year ended 2009, compared to the same period in 2008, principally due to the decrease in 2009 of issuances of long term debt and common stock, partially offset by the decrease in amounts spent to reacquire long term debt. Common Stock Dividends Common stock dividend payments were $241 million in 2010, $238 million in 2009, and $222 million in 2008. The increase in common dividends paid in 2010 was the result of additional shares outstanding, primarily shares issued under the Shareholder Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP). The increase in common dividends paid in 2009 was the result of additional shares outstanding, primarily due to PHIs sale of 16.1 million shares of common stock in November 2008. Changes in Outstanding Common Stock In November 2008, PHI sold 16.1 million shares of common stock in a registered offering at a price per share of $16.50, resulting in gross proceeds of $265 million. Under the DRP, PHI issued 1.8 million shares of common stock in 2010, 2.2 million shares of common stock in 2009, and 1.3 million shares of common stock in 2008. 66 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Changes in Outstanding Long Term Debt Cash flows from the issuance and redemption of long term debt in 2010, 2009 and 2008 are summarized in the charts below: 2010 2009 2008 Issuances (millions of dollars) PHI 2.70% senior notes due 2015 $ 250 $ $ 250 Pepco 6.20% tax exempt bonds due 2022 (a) 110 6.50% senior notes due 2037 (b) 250 7.90% first mortgage bonds due 2038 250 110 500 DPL 5.40% tax exempt bonds due 2031 (c) 78 1.80% tax exempt bonds due 2025 (d) 15 2.30% tax exempt bonds due 2028 (d) 16 6.40% first mortgage bonds due 2013 250 109 250 (f) ACE 4.875% tax exempt bonds due 2029 (e) 23 7.75% first mortgage bonds due 2018 250 23 250 Pepco Energy Services 1 $ 383 $ 110 $ 1,000 (a) Consists of Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds (Pepco 2022 Bonds) issued by the Maryland Economic Development Corporation for the benefit of Pepco that were purchased by Pepco in 2008. In connection with their resale by Pepco, the interest rate on the Pepco 2022 Bonds was changed from an auction rate to a fixed rate. The Pepco 2022 Bonds are secured by an outstanding series of senior notes issued by Pepco, and the senior notes are in turn secured by a series of collateral first mortgage bonds (Collateral First Mortgage Bonds) issued by Pepco. Both the senior notes and the Collateral First Mortgage Bonds have maturity dates, optional and mandatory redemption provisions, interest rates and interest payment dates that are identical to the terms of the Pepco 2022 Bonds. The payment by Pepco of its obligations with respect to the Pepco 2022 Bonds satisfies the corresponding payment obligations on the senior notes and Collateral First Mortgage Bonds. See Note (11), Debt, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI, set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. (b) Secured by an outstanding series of Collateral First Mortgage Bonds.

(d) Consists of Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds issued by DEDA for the benefit of DPL that were purchased by DPL in July 2010. See footnote (c) to the Redemptions and Repurchases table below. The bonds were resold to the public in December 2010. While DPL held the bonds, they remained outstanding as a contractual matter, but were considered extinguished for accounting purposes. In connection with the resale of the bonds, the interest rate on the bonds was changed (i) from 5.50% to a fixed rate of 1.80% with respect to the tax exempt bonds due 2025 and (ii) from 5.65% to a fixed rate of 2.30% with respect to the tax exempt bonds due 2028. The bonds are subject to mandatory purchase by DPL on June 1, 2012. (e) Consists of Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds (ACE Bonds) issued by The Pollution Control Financing Authority of Salem County for the benefit of ACE that were purchased by ACE in 2008. In connection with the resale by ACE, the interest rate on the ACE Bonds was changed from an auction rate to a fixed rate. The ACE Bonds are secured by an outstanding series of senior notes issued by ACE, and the senior notes are in turn secured by a series of Collateral First Mortgage Bonds issued by ACE. Both the senior notes and the Collateral First Mortgage Bonds have maturity dates, optional and mandatory redemption provisions, interest rates and interest payment dates that are identical to the terms of the ACE Bonds. The payment by ACE of its obligations with respect to the ACE Bonds satisfies the corresponding payment obligations on the senior notes and Collateral First Mortgage Bonds. See Note (11), Debt, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI, set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K.

The Pepco 2010 Bonds were secured by an outstanding series of Collateral First Mortgage Bonds issued by Pepco. The Collateral First Mortgage Bonds had maturity dates, optional and mandatory redemption provisions, interest rates and interest payment dates that were identical to the terms of the Pepco 2010 Bonds. Accordingly, the redemption of the Pepco 2010 Bonds at maturity automatically effected the redemption of the Collateral First Mortgage Bonds. (b) Repurchased by the indicated company pending resale to the public. See Purchase and Resale of Tax Exempt Auction Rate Bonds below. (c) Repurchased by DPL in July 2010 pursuant to a mandatory repurchase provision in the indenture for the bonds that was triggered by the expiration of the original interest period for the bonds. The bonds were resold by DPL in December 2010. See footnote (d) to the Issuances table above. 68 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Purchase and Resale of Tax Exempt Auction Rate Bonds In 2008, PHI subsidiaries purchased at par $276 million in aggregate principal amount of insured tax exempt auction rate bonds issued by municipal authorities for the benefit of the respective PHI subsidiaries. See footnote (b) to the Redemptions table above. These purchases were made in response to disruption in the market for municipal auction rate securities that made it difficult for the remarketing agent to successfully remarket the bonds at that time. Upon the purchase of the tax exempt bonds, the obligations of the PHI subsidiaries with respect to these tax exempt bonds were considered to be extinguished for accounting purposes; however, each of the companies continued to hold the bonds, while monitoring the market and evaluating the options for reselling the bonds to the public at some time in the future. Pepco purchased Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds issued by the Maryland Economic Development Corporation in the aggregate principal amount of $110 million. In 2009, the bonds were resold by Pepco to the public. See footnote (a) to the Issuances table above. DPL purchased Exempt Facilities Refunding Revenue Bonds issued by DEDA in the aggregate principal amount of $112 million. In 2009, DPL redeemed $33 million in principal amount of the bonds. In 2010, DEDA issued $78 million of 5.40% Gas Facilities Refunding Revenue Bonds due 2031 for the benefit of DPL. The proceeds were used by DPL to redeem $78 million in principal amount of the bonds purchased in 2008. See footnote (c) to the Issuances table above. ACE purchased (i) Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds issued by Cape May County in the aggregate principal amount of $32 million and (ii) Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds issued by Salem County in the aggregate principal amount of $23 million. In 2009, ACE redeemed $32 million in principal amount of the bonds. In March 2010, the remaining $23 million in aggregate principal amount of the bonds was resold by ACE to the public. See footnote (e) to the Issuances table above. Changes in Short Term Debt As of December 31, 2010, PHI had a total of $388 million of commercial paper outstanding as compared to $384 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2009 and no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2008. Due to the capital and credit market disruptions in 2008, the market for commercial paper was severely restricted. As a result, PHI and its subsidiaries were unable to issue commercial paper on a day to day basis either in amounts, or with maturities, that were typically required for cash management purposes. Given their restricted access to the commercial paper market and the general uncertainty in the credit markets, PHI and each of its subsidiaries borrowed under the $1.5 billion credit facility to create a cash reserve for future short term operating needs. As of December 31, 2008, PHI had a loan of $50 million outstanding and Pepco had a loan of $100 million outstanding under this facility. These loans were repaid in 2009. In 2008, both DPL and Pepco entered into short term bank loans. In March 2008, DPL obtained a $150 million unsecured bank loan that was repaid in July 2009. In May 2008, Pepco obtained a $25 million bank loan that was repaid in April 2009 and a $25 million bank loan that was repaid in September 2008. In 2008 and 2009, the following insured Variable Rate Demand Bonds issued by The Pollution Control Financing Authority of Salem County for the benefit of ACE (ACE VRDBs) were tendered to The Bank of New York Mellon, as bond trustee, by the holders and purchased by The Bank of New York Mellon pursuant to standby bond purchase agreements for the respective series: $18.2 million of Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds 1997 Series A due 2014 (ACE 1997A Bonds), and $4.4 million of Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds 1997 Series B due 2017. 69 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS In June 2009, the ACE VRDBs were resold to the public. In connection with this remarketing, the financial guaranty insurance policies issued as credit support for the ACE VRDBs were cancelled and replaced with letters of credit issued by The Bank of New York Mellon. In June 2010, the letters of credit expired and were replaced with new irrevocable direct pay letters of credit. The new letter of credit supporting the ACE 1997A Bonds expires in April 2014 and the new letter of credit for the ACE 1997B Bonds expires in June 2014. The expiration, cancellation, or termination of a letter of credit prior to the maturity of the related VRDBs will require ACE to repurchase the corresponding series of ACE VRDBs. In November 2008, DPL repurchased $9 million of Variable Rate Demand Bonds issued by DPL that were due 2024. For a further description of the Variable Rate Demand Bonds issued by or for the benefit of PHIs utility subsidiaries, see Note (11), Debt, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI, set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Sale of Virginia Retail Electric Distribution and Wholesale Transmission Assets In January 2008, DPL completed (i) the sale of its retail electric distribution assets on the Eastern Shore of Virginia for a purchase price of approximately $49 million, and (ii) the sale of its wholesale electric transmission assets located on the Eastern Shore of Virginia for a purchase price of approximately $5 million. Capital Requirements Capital Expenditures Pepco Holdings total capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2010 totaled $802 million, of which $359 million was incurred by Pepco, $250 million was incurred by DPL and $156 million was incurred by ACE, $7 million by Pepco Energy Services and $30 million by Corporate and Other. The Power Delivery expenditures were primarily related to capital costs associated with new customer services, distribution reliability and transmission. Corporate and Other capital expenditures primarily consisted of hardware and software expenditures which will be allocated to the Power Delivery Business when the assets are placed in service. The table below shows the projected capital expenditures for Power Delivery, Pepco Energy Services and Corporate and Other for the five year period 2011 through 2015. Pepco Holdings expects to fund these expenditures through internally generated cash and external financing. For the Year 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Total (millions of dollars) Power Delivery Distribution $ 511 $ 479 $ 483 $ 526 $ 544 $ 2,543 Distribution Blueprint for the Future 128 59 8 92 287 Transmission 245 225 197 137 171 975 Transmission MAPP 163 362 304 213 105 1,147 Gas Delivery 20 20 20 20 20 100 Other 75 50 44 42 53 264 Sub Total 1,142 1,195 1,056 1,030 893 5,316 DOE Capital Reimbursement Awards (a) (70 ) (26 ) (4 ) (100 ) Total for Power Delivery Business 1,072 1,169 1,052 1,030 893 5,216 Pepco Energy Services 16 12 9 2 1 40 Corporate and Other 3 3 3 3 3 15 Total PHI $ 1,091 $ 1,184 $ 1,064 $ 1,035 $ 897 $ 5,271 (a) Reflects remaining anticipated reimbursements pursuant to awards from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. 70 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS In 2009, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced awards under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 of: $105 million and $44 million in Pepcos Maryland and District of Columbia service territories, respectively for the implementation of an advanced metering infrastructure system, direct load control, distribution automation, and communications infrastructure. $19 million to ACE for the implementation of direct load control, distribution automation, and communications infrastructure in its New Jersey service territory. In April 2010, PHI and the DOE signed agreements formalizing the $168 million in awards. Of the $168 million, $130 million is expected to offset incurred and projected Blueprint for the Future and other capital expenditures of Pepco and ACE. The remaining $38 million will be used to offset incremental expenses associated with direct load control and other Pepco and ACE programs. In 2010, Pepco received award payments of $15 million and ACE received award payments of $2 million. The Internal Revenue Service has announced that, to the extent these grants are expended on capital items, they will not be considered taxable income. Transmission and Distribution The projected capital expenditures listed in the table for distribution (other than Blueprint for the Future), transmission (other than the MAPP project) and natural gas are primarily for facility replacements and upgrades to accommodate customer growth and reliability. During 2010, Pepco announced Comprehensive Reliability Enhancement Plans for Maryland and the District of Columbia. For a more detailed discussion of these plans, see Item 1, Business Description of Business Other Power Delivery Initiatives and Activities Reliability Enhancement Plans of this Form 10 K. Infrastructure Investment Plan In 2009, the NJBPU approved ACEs proposed Infrastructure Investment Plan and the revenue requirement associated with recovering the cost of the related projects, subject to a prudency review in the next rate case. The approved projects are designed to enhance reliability of ACEs distribution system and support economic activity and job growth in New Jersey in the near term. ACE will achieve cost recovery through an Infrastructure Investment Surcharge, which became effective on June 1, 2009. This approved plan added incremental capital spending of approximately $8 million for 2009 and $19 million for 2010, and is expected to add an additional $1 million of capital spending for 2011, which is included in Distribution in the table above. 71 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Blueprint for the Future Each of PHIs utility subsidiaries have undertaken programs to install smart meters, further automate their electric distribution systems and enhance their communications infrastructure, which they refer to as the Blueprint for the Future. For a discussion of the Blueprint for the Future initiative, see Item 1, Business Description of Business Blueprint for the Future of this Form 10 K. The projected capital expenditures over the next five years are shown as Distribution Blueprint for the Future in the table above. MAPP Project PHI has under development the construction of a new 230 mile, 500 kilovolt interstate transmission line as part of PJMs regional transmission expansion plan. For a description of the MAPP project, see Item 1, Business Description of Business MAPP Project of this Form 10 K. The projected capital expenditures over the next five years are shown as Transmission MAPP in the table above. MAPP/DOE Loan Program To assist in the funding of the MAPP project, PHI has applied for a $684 million loan guarantee from the Department of Energy (DOE) for a substantial portion of the MAPP project, primarily the Calvert Cliffs to Indian River segment. The application has been made under a federal loan guarantee program for projects that employ innovative energy efficiency, renewable energy and advanced transmission and distribution technologies. If granted, PHI believes the guarantee could allow PHI to acquire financing at a lower cost than it would otherwise be able to obtain in the capital markets. Whether PHIs application will be granted and, if so, the amount of debt guaranteed is subject to the discretion of the DOE and the negotiation of terms that will satisfy the conditions of the guarantee program. Smart Grid Workforce Training Grant In April 2010, the DOE awarded $4 million in federal stimulus funds to PHI as part of a three year Smart Grid Workforce Training Grant. PHI and its utility subsidiaries will use the grant to train employees in new roles as energy specialists and energy advisors, as well as to provide enhanced or supplementary training for existing roles such as customer service representatives, billing specialists and distribution engineers. PHI began the training activities in the spring of 2010. Dividends Pepco Holdings annual dividend rate on its common stock is determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration, among other factors, current and possible future developments that may affect PHIs income and cash flows. In 2010, PHIs Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of 27 cents per share of common stock payable on March 31, 2010, June 30, 2010, September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2010. On January 27, 2011, the Board of Directors declared a dividend on common stock of 27 cents per share payable March 31, 2011, to shareholders of record on March 10, 2011. PHI, on a stand alone basis, generates no operating income of its own. Accordingly, its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders depends on dividends received from its subsidiaries. In addition to their future financial performance, the ability of PHIs direct and indirect subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to limits imposed by: (i) state corporate laws, which impose limitations on the funds that can be used to pay dividends and, in the case of ACE, the regulatory requirement that it obtain the prior approval of the NJBPU before dividends can be paid if its equity as a percent of its total capitalization, excluding securitization debt, falls below 30%; (ii) the prior rights of holders of existing and future preferred stock, mortgage bonds and other long term debt issued by the subsidiaries, and any other restrictions imposed in connection with the incurrence of liabilities; and (iii) certain provisions of ACEs charter that impose restrictions on payment of common stock dividends for the benefit of preferred stockholders. Pepco and DPL have no shares of preferred stock outstanding. Currently, the capitalization ratio limitation to which ACE is subject and the restriction in the ACE charter do not limit ACEs ability to pay common stock dividends. PHI had approximately $1,059 million and $1,268 million of retained earnings free of restrictions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These amounts represent the total retained earnings balances at those dates. 72 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Summary information about Pepco Holdings consolidated contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2010, is as follows: Contractual Maturity Obligation Total Lessthan 1Year 1 3Years 3 5Years After 5Years (millions of dollars) Variable Rate Demand Bonds $ 146 $ 146 $ $ $ Commercial paper 388 388 Long term debt (a) 4,042 71 626 743 2,602 Long term project funding 19 4 4 3 8 Interest payments on debt 3,326 238 467 374 2,247 Capital leases 136 15 30 30 61 Operating leases 533 34 64 58 377 Estimated pension plan contributions 150 150 Non derivative fuel and purchase power contracts (b) 5,613 922 1,064 711 2,916 Total (c) $ 14,353 $ 1,968 $ 2,255 $ 1,919 $ 8,211 (a) Includes transition bonds issued by Atlantic City Electric Transition Funding, LLC.

In addition, costs are recoverable from customers. (c) Excludes $148 million of net non current liabilities related to uncertain tax positions due to uncertainty in the timing of the associated cash payments. Third Party Guarantees, Indemnifications and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements For a discussion of PHIs third party guarantees, indemnifications, obligations and off balance sheet arrangements, see Note (17), Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI, set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Energy Contract Net Asset Activity The following table provides detail on changes in the net asset or liability positions of both the Pepco Energy Services segment and the former Conectiv Energy segment with respect to energy commodity contracts for the year ended December 31, 2010. The balances in the table are pre tax and the derivative assets and liabilities reflect netting by counterparty before the impact of collateral. 73 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS EnergyCommodityActivities (a) (millions of dollars) Total Fair Value of Energy Contract Net Liabilities at December 31, 2009 $ (328 ) Current period unrealized losses (3 ) Effective portion of changes in fair value recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (100 ) Cash flow hedge ineffectiveness recorded in income Recognition of realized gains (losses) on settlement of contracts 137 Derivative activity associated with Conectiv Energy 76 Total Fair Value of Energy Contract Net Liabilities at December 31, 2010 $ (218 ) Detail of Fair Value of Energy Contract Net Liabilities at December 31, 2010 (see above) Derivative assets (current assets) $ 22 Derivative assets (non current assets) Derivative assets held for sale 7 Total Fair Value of Energy Contract Assets 29 Derivative liabilities (current liabilities) (144 ) Derivative liabilities (non current liabilities) (13 ) Derivative liabilities held for sale (90 ) Total Fair Value of Energy Contract Liabilities (247 ) Total Fair Value of Energy Contract Net Liabilities $ (218 ) (a) Includes all effective hedging activities recorded at fair value through AOCL or trading activities recorded at fair value in the consolidated statements of income, as required. The $218 million net liability on energy contracts at December 31, 2010 was primarily attributable to losses on power swaps and natural gas futures and swaps designated as hedges of future energy purchases for delivery to retail customers under FASB guidance on derivatives and hedging (ASC 815). Prices of electricity and natural gas declined during the year, which resulted in unrealized losses on the energy contracts of Pepco Energy Services and Conectiv Energy. Pepco Energy Services recorded unrealized losses of $100 million on energy contracts in AOCL as these energy contracts were effective hedges under the FASB guidance. PHI expects that when these energy contracts settle, the related realized gains or losses will be largely offset by the realized loss or gain on future energy purchases or production that will be used to settle the sales obligations with its customers. 74 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS PHI uses its best estimates to determine the fair value of the commodity and derivative contracts that are held and sold by Pepco Energy Services and Conectiv Energy. The fair values in each category presented below reflect forward prices and volatility factors as of December 31, 2010 and are subject to change as a result of changes in these factors.

The modeled valuation above represents the fair valuation of certain long dated power transactions based on limited observable broker prices extrapolated for periods beyond two years into the future. Contractual Arrangements with Credit Rating Triggers or Margining Rights Under certain contractual arrangements entered into by PHIs subsidiaries, the subsidiary may be required to provide cash collateral or letters of credit as security for its contractual obligations if the credit ratings of PHI or the subsidiary are downgraded. In the event of a downgrade, the amount required to be posted would depend on the amount of the underlying contractual obligation existing at the time of the downgrade. Based on contractual provisions in effect at December 31, 2010, a downgrade in the unsecured debt credit ratings of PHI or each of its rated subsidiaries to below investment grade would increase the collateral obligation of PHI and its subsidiaries by up to $359 million, $62 million of which is related to the discontinued operations of Conectiv Energy, and $176 million of which is the net settlement amount attributable to derivatives, normal purchase and normal sale contracts, collateral, and other contracts under master netting agreements as described in Note (15), Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI, set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The remaining $121 million of the collateral obligation that would be incurred in the event PHI were downgraded to below investment grade is attributable primarily to energy services contracts and accounts payable to independent system operators and distribution companies on full requirements contracts entered into by Pepco Energy Services. PHI believes that it and its utility subsidiaries currently have sufficient liquidity to fund their operations and meet their financial obligations. Many of the contractual arrangements entered into by PHIs subsidiaries in connection with competitive energy and Default Electricity Supply activities include margining rights pursuant to which the PHI subsidiary or a counterparty may request collateral if the market value of the contractual obligations reaches levels in excess of the credit thresholds established in the applicable arrangements. Pursuant to these margining rights, the affected PHI subsidiary may receive, or be required to post, collateral due to energy price movements. As of December 31, 2010, Pepco Energy Services provided net cash collateral in the amount of $117 million and Conectiv Energy provided net cash collateral in the amount of $104 million in connection with these activities. 75 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Environmental Remediation Obligations PHIs accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2010 include approximately $29 million, of which approximately $5 million is expected to be incurred in 2011, for potential environmental cleanup and related costs at sites owned or formerly owned by an operating subsidiary where an operating subsidiary is a potentially responsible party or is alleged to be a third party contributor. For further information concerning the remediation obligations associated with these sites, see Note (17), Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI, set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. For information regarding projected expenditures for environmental control facilities, see Item 1 Business Environmental Matters, of this Form 10 K. The most significant environmental remediation obligations as of December 31, 2010, were approximately: $14 million, of which approximately $600,000 is expected to be incurred in 2011, in environmental investigation and remediation costs payable by Pepco with respect to the Benning Road site. $5 million, of which approximately $1 million is expected to be incurred in 2011, payable by DPL in accordance with a 2001 consent agreement reached with the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, for remediation, site restoration, natural resource damage compensatory projects and other costs associated with environmental contamination that resulted from an oil release at the Indian River power plant, which DPL sold in June 2001. $4 million, none of which is expected to be incurred in 2011, for potential ISRA compliance remediation costs payable by PHI associated with the retained environmental exposure from the sale of the Conectiv Energy wholesale power generation business. $2 million, of which approximately $1.6 million is expected to be incurred in 2011, payable by DPL in connection with the Wilmington Coal Gas South site located in Wilmington, Delaware, to remediate residual material from the historical operation of a manufactured gas plant. Less than $4 million, payable by various PHI subsidiaries to resolve miscellaneous alleged environmental liabilities. Approximately $115,000 is expected to be incurred in 2011. Sources of Capital Pepco Holdings sources to meet its long term funding needs, such as capital expenditures, dividends, and new investments, and its short term funding needs, such as working capital and the temporary funding of long term funding needs, include internally generated funds, securities issuances and bank financing under new or existing facilities. PHIs ability to generate funds from its operations and to access capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties. Volatile and deteriorating financial market conditions, diminished liquidity and tightening credit may affect access to certain of PHIs potential funding sources. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10 K for additional discussion of important factors that may impact these sources of capital. Cash Flow from Operations Cash flow generated by regulated utility subsidiaries in the Power Delivery business is the primary source of PHIs cash flow from operations. Additional cash flows are generated by the business of Pepco Energy Services and from the occasional sale of non core assets. 76 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Short Term Funding Sources Pepco Holdings and its regulated utility subsidiaries have traditionally used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs, such as commercial paper, short term notes and bank lines of credit. Proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs but may also be used to temporarily fund long term capital requirements. Pepco Holdings maintains an ongoing commercial paper program of up to $875 million. Pepco and DPL have ongoing commercial paper programs of up to $500 million each, and ACE up to $250 million. The commercial paper can be issued with maturities of up to 270 days. Long Term Funding Sources The sources of long term funding for PHI and its subsidiaries are the issuance of debt and equity securities and borrowing under long term credit agreements. Proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements, such as capital expenditures and new investments, and to repay or refinance existing indebtedness. Regulatory Restrictions on Financing Activities The issuance of debt securities by PHIs principal subsidiaries requires the approval of either FERC or one or more state public utility commissions. Neither FERC approval nor state public utility commission approval is required as a condition to the issuance of securities by PHI. State Financing Authority Pepcos long term financing activities (including the issuance of securities and the incurrence of debt) are subject to authorization by the DCPSC and MPSC. DPLs long term financing activities are subject to authorization by the MPSC and the Delaware Public Service Commission. ACEs long term and short term (consisting of debt instruments with a maturity of one year or less) financing activities are subject to authorization by the NJBPU. Each utility, through periodic filings with the state public service commission(s) having jurisdiction over its financing activities, typically seeks to maintain standing authority sufficient to cover its projected financing needs over a multi year period. FERC Financing Authority Under the Federal Power Act (FPA), FERC has jurisdiction over the issuance of long term and short term securities of public utilities, but only if the issuance is not regulated by the state public utility commission in which the public utility is organized and operating. Under these provisions, FERC has jurisdiction over the issuance of short term debt by Pepco and DPL. Pepco and DPL have obtained FERC authority for the issuance of short term debt. Because Pepco Energy Services also qualifies as a public utility under the FPA and is not regulated by a state utility commission, FERC also has jurisdiction over the issuance of securities by Pepco Energy Services. Pepco Energy Services has obtained the requisite FERC financing authority in its market based rate orders. Money Pool Pepco Holdings operates a system money pool under a blanket authorization adopted by FERC. The money pool is a cash management mechanism used by Pepco Holdings to manage the short term investment and borrowing requirements of its subsidiaries that participate in the money pool. Pepco Holdings may invest in but not borrow from the money pool. Eligible subsidiaries with surplus cash may deposit those funds in the money pool. Deposits in the money pool are guaranteed by Pepco Holdings. Eligible subsidiaries with cash requirements may borrow from the money pool. Borrowings from the money pool are unsecured. Depositors in the money pool receive, and borrowers from the money pool pay, an interest rate based primarily on Pepco Holdings short term borrowing rate. Pepco Holdings deposits funds in the money pool to the extent that the pool has insufficient funds to meet the borrowing needs of its participants, which may require Pepco Holdings to borrow funds for deposit from external sources. 77 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Regulatory And Other Matters Rate Proceedings Distribution The rates that each of Pepco, DPL and ACE is permitted to charge for the retail distribution of electricity and natural gas to its various classes of customers are based on the principle that the utility is entitled to generate an amount of revenue sufficient to recover the cost of providing the service, including a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital. These base rates are intended to cover all of each utilitys reasonable and prudent expenses of constructing, operating and maintaining its distribution facilities (other than costs covered by specific cost recovery surcharges). A change in base rates in a jurisdiction requires the approval of public service commission. In the rate application submitted to the public service commission, the utility specifies an increase in its revenue requirement, which is the additional revenue that the utility is seeking authorization to earn. The revenue requirement consists of (i) the allowable expenses incurred by the utility, including operation and maintenance expenses, taxes and depreciation, and (ii) the utilitys cost of capital. The compensation of the utility for its cost of capital takes the form of an overall rate of return allowed by the public service commission on the utilitys distribution rate base to compensate the utilitys investors for their debt and equity investments in the company. The rate base is the aggregate value of the investment in property used by the utility in providing electricity and natural gas distribution services and generally consists of plant in service net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated deferred taxes, plus cash working capital, material and operating supplies and, depending on the jurisdiction, construction work in progress. Over time, the rate base is increased by utility property additions and reduced by depreciation and property retirements and write offs. In addition to its base rates, some of the costs of providing distribution service are recovered through the operation of surcharges. Examples of costs recovered by PHIs utility subsidiaries through surcharges, which vary depending on the jurisdiction, include: a surcharge to reimburse the utility for the cost of purchasing electricity from non utility generation sources (New Jersey); surcharges to reimburse the utility for costs of public interest programs for low income customers (New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware and the District of Columbia); a surcharge to pay the Transitional Bond Charge (New Jersey); and surcharges to reimburse the utility for certain environmental costs (Delaware and Maryland). Each utility subsidiary regularly reviews its distribution rates in each jurisdiction of its service territory, and from time to time files applications to adjust its rates as necessary in an effort to ensure that its revenues are sufficient to cover its operating expenses and its cost of capital. The timing of future rate filings and the change in the distribution rate requested will depend on a number of factors, including changes in revenues and expenses and the incurrence or the planned incurrence of capital expenditures. In 2011, Pepco currently expects to file an electricity base rate increase application in the District of Columbia and Maryland, and ACE currently expects to file an electricity base rate increase application in New Jersey. DPL currently expects to file a natural gas base rate increase application in early 2012. In general, a request for new distribution rates is made on the basis of test year balances for rate base allowable operating expenses and a requested rate of return. The test year amounts used in the filing may be historical or partially projected. The public service commission may, however, select a different test period than that proposed by the company. Although the approved tariff rates are intended to be forward looking, and therefore provide for the recovery of some future changes in rate base and operating costs, they typically do not reflect all of the changes in costs for the period in which the new rates are in effect. 78 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS If revenues do not keep pace with increases in costs, this will result in a lag between when the costs are incurred and when the utility can begin to recover those costs through its rates. The following table shows, for each of the PHI utility subsidiaries, the authorized return on equity as determined in the most recently concluded base rate proceeding and the date as of which the rate as determined in the proceeding was implemented: Rate Base (In millions) AuthorizedReturn on Equity Rate EffectiveDate Pepco: District of Columbia (electricity) 9.625 % March 2010 Maryland (electricity) 9.83 % July 2010 DPL: Delaware (electricity) 10.00 % February 2011 Maryland (electricity) 10.00 % December 2009 Delaware (natural gas) 10.25 % April 2007 ACE: New Jersey (electricity) 10.30 % June 2010 Transmission The rates Pepco, DPL and ACE are permitted to charge for the transmission of electricity are regulated by FERC and are based on each utilitys transmission rate base, transmission operating expenses and an overall rate of return that is approved by FERC. For each utility subsidiary, FERC has approved a formula for the calculation of the companys transmission rate, which is referred to as a formula rate. The formula rates include both fixed and variable elements. Certain of the fixed elements, such as the return on equity and depreciation rates, can be changed only in a FERC rate proceeding. The variable elements of the formula, including the utilitys rate base and operating expenses, are updated annually, effective June 1 of each year, with data from the utilitys most recent annual FERC Form 1 filing. In addition to its formula rate, each utilitys return on equity is supplemented by incentive rates, sometimes referred to as adders, and other incentives, which are authorized by FERC to promote capital investment in transmission infrastructure. For example, in connection with the MAPP project, FERC has authorized for each of Pepco and DPL a 150 basis point adder to its return on equity, resulting in a FERC approved rate of return on the MAPP project of 12.8%, along with full recovery of construction work in progress and prudently incurred abandoned plant costs. Additional return on equity adders are in effect for each of Pepco, DPL and ACE relating to specific transmission upgrades and improvements, as well as in consideration for each utilitys continued membership in PJM. As members of PJM, the transmission rates of Pepco, DPL and ACE are set out in PJMs Open Access Transmission Tariff. For a discussion of pending state public utility commission and FERC rate proceedings, see Note (17), Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI set forth in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10 K. Legal Proceedings and Other Regulatory Matters For a discussion of legal proceedings and other regulatory matters, see Note (17), Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI, set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 79 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Critical Accounting Policies General Pepco Holdings has identified the following accounting policies, including certain estimates, that as a result of the judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved, could result in material changes in its financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions. Pepco Holdings has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Goodwill Impairment Evaluation Substantially all of PHIs goodwill was generated by Pepcos acquisition of Conectiv in 2002 and is allocated entirely to the Power Delivery reporting unit for purposes of assessing impairment under FASB guidance on goodwill and other intangibles (ASC 350). Management has identified Power Delivery as a single reporting unit based on the aggregation of components which have similar economic characteristics, similar products and services and operate in a similar regulatory environment. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. Management uses its best judgment to make reasonable projections of future cash flows for Power Delivery when estimating the reporting units fair value. In addition, PHI selects a discount rate for the associated risk with those estimated cash flows. These judgments are inherently uncertain, and actual results could vary from those used in PHIs estimates. The impact of such variations could significantly alter the results of a goodwill impairment test, which could materially impact the estimated fair value of Power Delivery and potentially the amount of any impairment recorded in the financial statements. PHI tests its goodwill impairment at least annually as of November 1 and on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Factors that may result in an interim impairment test include, but are not limited to: a change in identified reporting units; an adverse change in business conditions; a protracted decline in stock price causing market capitalization to fall below book value; an adverse regulatory action; or impairment of long lived assets in the reporting unit. PHIs November 1, 2010 annual impairment test indicated that its goodwill was not impaired. See Note (6), Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI, set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Although PHIs market capitalization remained below book value as of December 31, 2010, PHI did not perform an interim goodwill impairment test because its market capitalization relative to book value improved compared to earlier periods in which it performed an interim impairment test and there were no other indicators of potential impairment. PHI performed interim tests of goodwill for impairment as of March 31, 2009 and as of December 31, 2008 as its market capitalization was below its book value at both points in time and its market capitalization relative to book value had significantly declined. PHI concluded that its goodwill was not impaired at these interim dates. In order to estimate the fair value of the Power Delivery reporting unit, PHI uses two valuation techniques: an income approach and a market approach. The income approach estimates fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis using estimated future cash flows and a terminal value that is consistent with Power Deliverys long term view of the business. This approach uses a discount rate based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the reporting unit. PHI determines the estimated WACC by considering market based information for the cost of equity and cost of debt that is appropriate for the Power Delivery business as of the measurement date. The market approach estimates fair value based on a multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) that management believes is consistent with EBITDA multiples for comparable utilities. PHI has consistently used this valuation framework to estimate the fair value of Power Delivery. 80 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS The estimation of fair value is dependent on a number of factors that are sourced from the Power Delivery reporting units business forecast, including but not limited to interest rates, growth assumptions, returns on rate base, operating and capital expenditure requirements, and other factors, changes in which could materially impact the results of impairment testing. Assumptions and methodologies used in the models were consistent with historical experience. A hypothetical 10 percent decrease in fair value of the Power Delivery reporting unit at November 1, 2010 would not have resulted in the Power Delivery reporting unit failing the first step of the impairment test, as defined in the guidance, as the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would have been above its carrying value. Sensitive, interrelated and uncertain variables that could decrease the estimated fair value of the Power Delivery reporting unit include utility sector market performance, sustained adverse business conditions, change in forecasted revenues, higher operating and maintenance capital expenditure requirements, a significant increase in the cost of capital, and other factors. PHI believes that the estimates involved in its goodwill impairment evaluation process represent Critical Accounting Estimates because they are subjective and susceptible to change from period to period as management makes assumptions and judgments, and the impact of a change in assumptions and estimates could be material to financial results. Long Lived Assets Impairment Evaluation Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in its long lived asset impairment evaluation process represent Critical Accounting Estimates because (i) they are highly susceptible to change from period to period because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about when events indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable and how to estimate undiscounted and discounted future cash flows and fair values, which are inherently uncertain, (ii) actual results could vary from those used in Pepco Holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material, and (iii) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on Pepco Holdings assets as well as the net loss related to an impairment charge could be material. The primary assets subject to a long lived asset impairment evaluation are property, plant, and equipment. The FASB guidance on the accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets (ASC 360), requires that certain long lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, such as (i) a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset or asset group, (ii) a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition, (iii) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, (iv) an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset or asset group, (v) a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group, and (vi) a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. An impairment loss may only be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. The asset is deemed not to be recoverable when its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. In order to estimate an assets future cash flows, Pepco Holdings considers historical cash flows. Pepco Holdings uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel costs, legislative initiatives, and operating costs. If necessary, the process of determining fair value is done consistent with the process described in assessing the fair value of goodwill discussed above. 81 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Accounting for Derivatives Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in accounting for its derivative instruments represent Critical Accounting Estimates because management exercises judgment in the following areas, any of which could have a material impact on its financial statements: (i) the application of the definition of a derivative to contracts to identify derivatives, (ii) the election of the normal purchases and normal sales exception from derivative accounting, (iii) the application of cash flow hedge accounting, and (iv) the estimation of fair value used in the measurement of derivatives and hedged items, which are highly susceptible to changes in value over time due to market trends or, in certain circumstances, significant uncertainties in modeling techniques used to measure fair value that could result in actual results being materially different from Pepco Holdings estimates. See Note (2), Significant Accounting Policies Accounting for Derivatives, and Note (15), Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI, set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for information on PHIs accounting for derivatives. Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments primarily to manage risk associated with commodity prices. The definition of a derivative in the FASB guidance results in management having to exercise judgment, such as whether there is a notional amount or net settlement provision in contracts. Management assesses a number of factors before determining whether it can designate derivatives for the normal purchase or normal sale exception from derivative accounting, including whether it is probable that the contracts will physically settle with delivery of the underlying commodity. The application of cash flow hedge accounting often requires judgment in the prospective and retrospective assessment and measurement of hedge effectiveness as well as whether it is probable that the forecasted transaction will occur. The fair value of derivatives is determined using quoted exchange prices where available. For instruments that are not traded on an exchange, external broker quotes are used to determine fair value. For some custom and complex instruments, internal models use market information when external broker quotes are not available. For certain long dated instruments, broker or exchange data is extrapolated for future periods where information is limited. Models are also used to estimate volumes for certain transactions. The same valuation methods are used for risk management purposes to determine the value of non derivative, commodity exposure. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in reporting the costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefits represent Critical Accounting Estimates because (i) they are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of assumptions which are subjective in nature, (ii) they are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience, and (iii) changes in assumptions could impact Pepco Holdings expected future cash funding requirements for the plans and would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations, which affect the reported amount of annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost on the income statement. Assumptions about the future, including the discount rate applied to benefit obligations, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, the anticipated rate of increase in health care costs and participant compensation have a significant impact on employee benefit costs. The discount rate for determining the pension benefit obligation was 5.65% and 6.40% as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The discount rate for determining the postretirement benefit obligation was 5.60% and 6.30% as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. PHI utilizes an analytical tool developed by its actuaries to select the discount rate. The analytical tool utilizes a high quality bond portfolio with cash flows that match the benefit payments expected to be made under the plans. 82 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS The expected long term rate of return on plan assets was 8.00% and 8.25% as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In selecting an expected long term rate of return on plan assets, PHI considers actual historical returns, economic forecasts and the judgment of its investment consultants on expected long term performance for the types of investments held by the plan. The estimated asset class returns are weighted by PHIs target asset allocation. The plan assets consist of equity, fixed income investments, real estate and private equity, and when viewed over a long term horizon, are expected to yield a return on assets of 8.00% as of December 31, 2010. Assumptions about the future, including the expected return on plan assets, discount rate applied to benefit obligations, the anticipated rate of increase in health care costs and participant compensation have a significant impact on employee benefit costs. The following table reflects the effect on the projected benefit obligation and the net periodic cost associated with changing the critical actuarial assumptions while holding all other actuarial assumptions constant: (in millions, except percentages) Change inAssumptions Impact onProjectedBenefitObligation ProjectedIncrease in2010 NetPeriodic Cost Pension Plan Discount rate (0.25 )% $ 40 $ 3 Expected return (0.25 )% (a) 4 Postretirement Benefit Plan Discount rate (0.25 )% $ 16 $ 1 Expected return (0.25 )% (a) 1 Healthcare cost trend 1.00 % 32 2 (a) A change in the expected return assumption has no impact on the Projected Benefit Obligation. The impact of changes in assumptions and the difference between actual and expected or estimated results on pension and postretirement obligations is generally recognized over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans rather than immediately recognized in the statements of income. For additional discussion, see Note (10), Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI, set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Accounting for Regulated Activities FASB guidance on the accounting for regulated activities, Regulated Operations (ASC 980), applies to the Power Delivery businesses of Pepco, DPL, and ACE and can result in the deferral of costs or revenue that would otherwise be recognized by non regulated entities. PHI defers the recognition of costs and records regulatory assets when it is probable that those costs will be recovered in future rates charged to its customers. PHI defers the recognition of revenues and records regulatory liabilities when it is probable that it will refund payments received from customers in the future or that it will incur future costs related to the payments currently received from customers. Pepco Holdings believes that the judgments involved in accounting for its regulated activities represent Critical Accounting Estimates because (i) management must interpret laws and regulatory commission orders to assess the probability of the recovery of costs from customers or the return of revenues to customers when determining whether those costs or revenues should be deferred, (ii) decisions made by regulatory commissions or legislative changes at a later date could vary from earlier interpretations made by management and the impact of such variations could be material, and (iii) writing off a regulatory asset because deferred costs are no longer probable of recovery in future rates charged to customers could have a material negative impact on Pepco Holdings assets and earnings. 83 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Managements most significant judgment is whether to defer costs or revenues when there is not a current regulatory order specific to the item being considered for deferral. In those cases, management considers relevant historical precedents of the regulatory commissions, the results of recent rate orders, and any new information from its more current interactions with the regulatory commissions on that item. Management regularly reviews its regulatory assets and liabilities to determine whether adjustments to its previous conclusions are necessary based on the current regulatory and legislative environment as well as recent rate orders. Unbilled Revenue Unbilled revenue represents an estimate of revenue earned from services rendered by Pepco Holdings utility operations that have not yet been billed. Pepco Holdings utility operations calculate unbilled revenue using an output based methodology. The calculation is based on the supply of electricity or natural gas distributed to customers but not yet billed and adjusted for estimated line loss (estimates of electricity and gas expected to be lost in the process of its transmission and distribution to customers). Pepco Holdings believes that the estimates involved in its unbilled revenue process represent Critical Accounting Estimates because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about input factors to the unbilled revenue calculation. Specifically, the determination of estimated line loss is inherently uncertain. Estimated line loss is defined as the estimates of electricity and natural gas expected to be lost in the process of its transmission and distribution to customers. A change in estimated line loss can change the output available for sale which is a factor in the unbilled revenue calculation. Certain factors can influence the estimated line loss such as weather and a change in customer mix. These factors may vary between companies due to geography and density of service territory and the impact of changes in these factors could be material. Pepco Holdings seeks to reduce the risk of an inaccurate estimate of unbilled revenue through corroboration of the estimate with historical information and other metrics. Accounting for Income Taxes Pepco Holdings exercises significant judgment about the outcome of income tax matters in its application of the FASB guidance on accounting for income taxes and believes it represents a Critical Accounting Estimate because: (i) it records a current tax liability for estimated current tax expense on its federal and state tax returns; (ii) it records deferred tax assets for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return determination of pre tax income and the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are more likely than not going to result in tax deductions in future years; (iii) it determines whether a valuation allowance is needed against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion of the future tax deductions will not be realized; (iv) it records deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return determination of pre tax income and the carrying amount of assets and liabilities if it is more likely than not that they are expected to result in tax payments in future years; (v) the measurement of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities requires it to estimate future effective tax rates and future taxable income on its federal and state tax returns; (vi) it must consider the effect of newly enacted tax law on its estimated effective tax rate and in measuring deferred tax balances; and (vii) it asserts that tax positions in its tax returns or expected to be taken in its tax returns are more likely than not to be sustained assuming that the tax positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements and that the benefit recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Assumptions, judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard has been met when developing the provision for current and deferred income taxes and the associated current and deferred tax assets and liabilities. Pepco Holdings assumptions, judgments and estimates take into account current tax laws and regulations, interpretation of current tax laws and 84 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS regulations, the impact of newly enacted tax laws and regulations, developments in case law, settlements of tax positions, and the possible outcomes of current and future investigations conducted by tax authorities. Pepco Holdings has established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. Although Pepco Holdings believes that these assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws and regulations or its interpretation of tax laws and regulations as well as the resolutions of the current and any future investigations or legal proceedings could significantly impact the financial results from applying the accounting for income taxes in the consolidated financial statements. Pepco Holdings reviews its application of the more likely than not standard quarterly. Pepco Holdings also evaluates quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or successfully implement tax planning strategies may affect the realization of deferred tax assets and the amount of any associated valuation allowance. The forecast of future taxable income is dependent on a number of factors that can change over time, including growth assumptions, business conditions, returns on rate base, operating and capital expenditures, cost of capital, tax laws and regulations, the legal structure of entities and other factors, which could materially impact the realizability of deferred tax assets and the associated financial results in the consolidated financial statements. New Accounting Standards and Pronouncements For information concerning new accounting standards and pronouncements that have recently been adopted by PHI and its subsidiaries or that one or more of the companies will be required to adopt on or before a specified date in the future, see Note (3), Newly Adopted Accounting Standards, and Note (4), Recently Issued Accounting Standards, Not Yet Adopted, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI, set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 85 Table of Contents PEPCO HOLDINGS Forward Looking Statements Some of the statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are subject to the safe harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

General Overview Pepco is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity in the District of Columbia and major portions of Montgomery County and Prince Georges County in suburban Maryland. Pepco also provides Default Electricity Supply, which is the supply of electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territories who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier. Default Electricity Supply is known as Standard Offer Service (SOS) in both the District of Columbia and Maryland. Pepcos service territory covers approximately 640 square miles and has a population of approximately 2.2 million. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 57% of delivered electricity sales were to Maryland customers and approximately 43% were to the District of Columbia customers. Effective June 2007, the Maryland Public Service Commission (MPSC) approved a bill stabilization adjustment mechanism (BSA) for retail customers. The District of Columbia Public Service Commission (DCPSC) also approved a BSA for retail customers, effective in November 2009. For customers to whom the BSA applies, Pepco recognizes distribution revenue based on the approved distribution charge per customer. From a revenue recognition standpoint, this has the effect of decoupling distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period. As a consequence, the only factors that will cause distribution revenue in Maryland and the District of Columbia to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer. For customers to whom the BSA applies, changes in customer usage (such as due to weather conditions, energy prices, energy efficiency programs or other reasons) from period to period have no impact on reported distribution revenue. As a result of the BSA in Maryland and the District of Columbia, a Revenue Decoupling Adjustment is recorded representing either (i) a positive adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from Maryland and District of Columbia retail distribution sales falls short of the revenue that Pepco is entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer or (ii) a negative adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from such distribution sales exceeds the revenue that Pepco is entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer. Pepco is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI or Pepco Holdings). Because PHI is a public utility holding company subject to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005), the relationship between PHI and Pepco and certain activities of Pepco are subject to the regulatory oversight of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) under PUHCA 2005. 88 Table of Contents PEPCO Results Of Operations The following results of operations discussion compares the year ended December 31, 2010 to the year ended December 31, 2009. All amounts in the tables (except sales and customers) are in millions of dollars. Operating Revenue 2010 2009 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 1,068 $ 947 $ 121 Default Electricity Supply Revenue 1,185 1,251 (66 ) Other Electric Revenue 35 33 2 Total Operating Revenue $ 2,288 $ 2,231 $ 57 The table above shows the amount of Operating Revenue earned that is subject to price regulation (Regulated Transmission & Distribution (T&D) Electric Revenue and Default Electricity Supply Revenue) and that which is not subject to price regulation (Other Electric Revenue). Regulated T&D Electric Revenue includes revenue from the distribution of electricity, including the distribution of Default Electricity Supply, to Pepcos customers within its service territory at regulated rates. Regulated T&D Electric Revenue also includes transmission service revenue that Pepco receives as a transmission owner from PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM) at rates regulated by FERC. Transmission rates are updated annually based on a FERC approved formula methodology. Default Electricity Supply Revenue is the revenue received from the supply of electricity by Pepco at regulated rates to retail customers who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier, and which is also known as Standard Offer Service. The costs related to Default Electricity Supply are included in Purchased Energy. Default Electricity Supply Revenue also includes transmission enhancement credits that Pepco receives as a transmission owner from PJM for approved regional transmission expansion plan costs. Other Electric Revenue includes work and services performed on behalf of customers, including other utilities, which is generally not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of pole attachments, late payment fees, and collection fees.

An increase of $17 million in transmission revenue primarily attributable to higher rates effective June 1, 2010 related to an increase in transmission plant investment. An increase of $14 million due to distribution rate increases in the District of Columbia that became effective in November 2009 and March 2010. An increase of $6 million due to higher revenue in the District of Columbia service territory as a result of milder than normal weather during the 2009 spring and summer months as compared to the base period used in establishing the 2010 BSA rates. The BSA was not implemented in the District of Columbia until November 2009; therefore, a change in weather was a factor when comparing revenue from period to period. An increase of $10 million due to the implementation of the EmPower Maryland (a demand side management program) surcharge in March 2010 (which is substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Depreciation and Amortization). An increase of $8 million due to customer growth of 1% in 2010, primarily in the residential class.

A decrease of $47 million as a result of lower Default Electricity Supply rates. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $67 million due to higher sales primarily as a result of warmer weather during the 2010 spring and summer months as compared to 2009. The following table shows the percentages of Pepcos total distribution sales by jurisdiction that are derived from customers receiving Default Electricity Supply from Pepco. Amounts are for the year ended December 31. 2010 2009 Sales to District of Columbia customers 29 % 31 % Sales to Maryland customers 46 % 49 % Operating Expenses Purchased Energy Purchased Energy consists of the cost of electricity purchased by Pepco to fulfill its Default Electricity Supply obligation and, as such, is recoverable from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders. Purchased Energy decreased by $71 million to $1,152 million in 2010 from $1,223 million in 2009 primarily due to: A decrease of $85 million primarily due to commercial customer migration to competitive suppliers. A decrease of $39 million in deferred electricity expense primarily due to lower Default Electricity Supply Revenue rates, which resulted in a lower rate of recovery of Default Electricity Supply costs. A decrease of $8 million due to lower average electricity costs under Default Electricity Supply contracts. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $60 million due to higher sales primarily as a result of warmer weather during the 2010 spring and summer months as compared to 2009. 91 Table of Contents PEPCO Other Operation and Maintenance Other Operation and Maintenance increased by $26 million to $354 million in 2010 from $328 million in 2009. Excluding an increase of $2 million primarily related to bad debt expenses that are deferred and recoverable in Default Electricity Supply Revenue, Other Operation and Maintenance expense increased by $24 million. The $24 million increase was primarily due to: An increase of $22 million in emergency restoration costs primarily due to severe storms in February, July and August 2010. An increase of $13 million in estimated environmental remediation costs due to the establishment of a reserve relating to a possible discharge of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at the Benning Road transmission and distribution facility, as further discussed under the heading Benning Road Site in Note (13), Commitments and Contingencies, to the Pepco financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. An increase of $3 million primarily due to system support and customer support services costs. An increase of $3 million primarily due to higher tree trimming costs. An increase of $2 million due to higher non deferrable bad debt expenses. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $11 million primarily due to Pepco deferrals of (i) February 2010 severe winter storm costs and (ii) distribution rate case costs, which in each case originally had been charged to Other Operation and Maintenance expense. These deferrals were recorded in accordance with a MPSC rate order issued in August 2010 and a DCPSC rate order issued in February 2010, respectively, authorizing the establishment of regulatory assets for the recovery of these costs. A decrease of $7 million in employee related costs, primarily due to lower pension and other postretirement benefit expenses. Restructuring Charge With the ongoing wind down of the retail energy supply business of Pepco Energy Services and the disposition of Conectiv Energy, PHI is repositioning itself as a regulated transmission and distribution company. In connection with this repositioning, PHI commenced a comprehensive organizational review in the second quarter of 2010 to identify opportunities to streamline the organization and to achieve certain reductions in corporate overhead costs that are allocated to its operating segments. This review has resulted in the adoption of a restructuring plan. PHI began implementing the plan during the third quarter, identifying 164 employee positions that were eliminated during the fourth quarter of 2010. The plan also focuses on identifying additional cost reduction opportunities through process improvements and operational efficiencies. PHI currently estimates that the implementation of the plan will result in an annual reduction of approximately $28 million in corporate overhead costs. In connection with the plan, Pepco recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, related to severance, pension, and health and welfare benefits to be provided to terminated employees. 92 Table of Contents PEPCO Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and Amortization expense increased by $17 million to $162 million in 2010 from $145 million in 2009 primarily due to: An increase of $9 million in amortization of regulatory assets primarily due to the EmPower Maryland surcharge that became effective in March 2010 (which is substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue). An increase of $4 million due to utility plant additions. An increase of $2 million in the amortization of Demand Side Management deferred expenses. Other Taxes Other Taxes increased by $62 million to $364 million in 2010 from $302 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to increased pass throughs resulting from utility tax rate increases imposed by Montgomery County, Maryland (which are substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue). Effect of Divestiture Related Claims District of Columbia Divestiture Case The DCPSC on May 18, 2010 issued an order addressing all of the outstanding issues relating to Pepcos obligation to share with its District of Columbia customers the net proceeds realized by Pepco from the sale of its generation related assets in 2000. This order disallowed certain items that Pepco had included in the costs it deducted in calculating the net proceeds of the sale. The disallowance of these costs, together with interest, increased the aggregate amount Pepco is required to distribute to customers by approximately $11 million. While Pepco has filed an appeal of the DCPSCs decision with the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, in view of the DCPSC order, PHI recognized a pre tax expense of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The appeal is still pending. Settlement of Mirant Bankruptcy Claims In March 2009, the DCPSC approved an allocation between Pepco and its District of Columbia customers of the District of Columbia portion of the Mirant Corporation (Mirant) bankruptcy settlement proceeds remaining after the transfer of the power purchase agreement between Pepco and Panda Brandywine, L.P. As a result, Pepco recorded a pre tax gain of $14 million in the first quarter of 2009 reflecting the District of Columbia proceeds retained by Pepco. In July 2009, the MPSC approved an allocation between Pepco and its Maryland customers of the Maryland portion of the Mirant bankruptcy settlement proceeds. As a result, Pepco recorded a pre tax gain of $26 million in the third quarter of 2009 reflecting the Maryland proceeds retained by Pepco. Other Income (Expenses) Other Expenses (which are net of Other Income) decreased by $6 million to a net expense of $85 million in 2010 from a net expense of $91 million in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to: An increase of $4 million in income related to Allowance for Funds Used During Construction that is applied to capital projects. An increase of $3 million in other income due to gains on the sale of four parcels of land in 2010. 93 Table of Contents PEPCO Income Tax Expense Pepcos effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were 25.5% and 41.8%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate resulted primarily from the November 2010 settlement PHI reached with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with respect to its Federal tax returns for the years 1996 to 2002. In connection with the settlement, Pepco reallocated certain amounts on deposit with the IRS since 2006 among liabilities in the settlement years and subsequent years. In light of the settlement and reallocations, Pepco has recalculated the estimated interest due for the tax years 1996 to 2002. The revised estimate has resulted in the reversal of $24 million (after tax) of previously accrued estimated interest due to the IRS. This reversal has been recorded as an income tax benefit in 2010, and is subject to adjustment when the IRS finalizes its calculation of the amount due. This benefit was partially offset by an $8 million reversal of previously recorded tax benefits and $5 million of other adjustments. Capital Requirements Sources of Capital Pepco has a range of capital sources available, in addition to internally generated funds, to meet its long term and short term funding needs. The sources of long term funding include the issuance of mortgage bonds and other debt securities and bank financings, as well as the ability to issue preferred stock. Proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements, such as capital expenditures, and to repay or refinance existing indebtedness. Pepco traditionally has used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs, including commercial paper, short term notes, bank lines of credit and borrowings under the PHI money pool. Proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs, but may also be used to temporarily fund long term capital requirements. Pepcos ability to generate funds from its operations and to access the capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties. Volatile and deteriorating financial market conditions, diminished liquidity and tightening credit may affect access to certain of Pepcos potential funding sources. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10 K, for additional discussion of important factors that may have an effect on Pepcos sources of capital. Debt Securities Pepco has a Mortgage and Deed of Trust (the Mortgage) under which it issues First Mortgage Bonds. First Mortgage Bonds issued under the Mortgage are secured by a lien on substantially all of Pepcos property, plant and equipment. The principal amount of First Mortgage Bonds that Pepco may issue under the Mortgage is limited by the principal amount of retired First Mortgage Bonds and 60% of the lesser of the cost or fair value of new property additions that have not been used as the basis for the issuance of additional First Mortgage Bonds. Pepco also has an Indenture under which it issues senior notes secured by First Mortgage Bonds and an Indenture under which it can issue unsecured debt securities, including medium term notes. To fund the construction of pollution control facilities, Pepco also has from time to time issued tax exempt bonds through a municipality or public agency, the proceeds of which are loaned to Pepco by the municipality or agency. Information concerning the principal amount and terms of Pepcos outstanding debt securities, as of December 31, 2010, is set forth in Note (10), Debt, to the financial statements of Pepco set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Bank Financing As further discussed in Note (10), Debt, to the financial statements of Pepco set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K, Pepco participates in a $1.5 billion credit facility, along with PHI, Delmarva Power & Light Company (DPL) and Atlantic City Electric Company (ACE). The facility, all or any portion of which may be used to obtain loans or to issue letters of credit, expires in 2012. Pepcos credit limit under the facility is the lesser of $500 million and the maximum amount of debt Pepco is permitted to have outstanding by its regulatory authorities, except that the aggregate amount of credit used by Pepco, DPL and ACE at any given time may not collectively exceed $625 million. 94 Table of Contents PEPCO Commercial Paper Program Pepco maintains an ongoing commercial paper program of up to $500 million under which it can issue commercial paper with maturities of up to 270 days. The commercial paper is backed by Pepcos borrowing capacity under the PHI $1.5 billion credit facility. Money Pool Pepco participates in the money pool operated by PHI under authorization received from FERC. The money pool is a cash management mechanism used by PHI and eligible subsidiaries to manage their short term investment and borrowing requirements. PHI may invest in, but not borrow from, the money pool. Eligible subsidiaries with surplus cash may deposit those funds in the money pool. Deposits in the money pool are guaranteed by PHI. Eligible subsidiaries with cash requirements may borrow from the money pool. Borrowings from the money pool are unsecured. Depositors in the money pool receive, and borrowers from the money pool pay, an interest rate based primarily on PHIs short term borrowing rate. PHI deposits funds in the money pool to the extent that the pool has insufficient funds to meet the borrowing needs of its participants, which PHI may obtain from external sources. Preferred Stock Under its Articles of Incorporation, Pepco is authorized to issue and have outstanding up to 6 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series, with each series having such rights, preferences and limitations, including dividend and voting rights and redemption provisions, as the Board of Directors may establish. As of December 31, 2010, there were no shares of Pepco preferred stock outstanding. Regulatory Restrictions on Financing Activities Pepcos long term financing activities (including the issuance of securities and the incurrence of debt) are subject to authorization by the DCPSC and MPSC. Through its periodic filings with the respective utility commissions, Pepco generally seeks to maintain standing authority sufficient to cover its projected financing needs over a multi year period. Under the Federal Power Act, FERC has jurisdiction over the issuance of long term and short term securities of public utilities, but only if the issuance is not regulated by the state public utility commission in which the public utility is organized and operating. Under these provisions, Pepco is required to obtain FERC authorization for the issuance of short term debt. Capital Expenditures Pepcos capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2010, totaled $359 million. These expenditures were primarily related to capital costs associated with new customer services, distribution reliability and transmission. The expenditures also include an allocation by PHI of hardware and software expenditures that primarily benefit the Power Delivery business and are allocated to Pepco when the assets are placed in service. The following table shows Pepcos projected capital expenditures for the five year period 2011 through 2015. Pepco expects to fund these expenditures through internally generated cash, external financing and capital contributions from PHI. 95 Table of Contents PEPCO For the Year 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Total (millions of dollars) Pepco Distribution $ 291 $ 273 $ 259 $ 288 $ 317 $ 1,428 Distribution Blueprint for the Future 103 19 122 Transmission 136 86 74 30 64 390 Transmission MAPP 112 216 166 139 45 678 Other 28 16 10 13 19 86 Sub Total 670 610 509 470 445 2,704 DOE Capital Reimbursement Awards (a) (65 ) (22 ) (3 ) (90 ) Total Pepco $ 605 $ 588 $ 506 $ 470 $ 445 $ 2,614 (a) Reflects anticipated reimbursements pursuant to awards from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Reliability Enhancement Plans During 2010, Pepco announced Comprehensive Reliability Enhancement Plans for Maryland and the District of Columbia. For a more detailed discussion of these plans, see Item 1, Business Description of Business Other Power Delivery Initiatives and Activities Reliability Enhancement Plans of this Form 10 K. Stimulus Funds Related to Blueprint for the Future In 2009, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced a $168 million award to PHI under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for the implementation of an advanced metering infrastructure system, direct load control, distribution automation, and communications infrastructure. Pepco was awarded $149 million with $105 million to be used in the Maryland service territory and $44 million to be used in the District of Columbia service territory. In April 2010, PHI and the DOE signed agreements formalizing Pepcos $149 million share of the $168 million award. Of the $149 million, $118 million is expected to offset incurred and projected Blueprint for the Future and other capital expenditures of Pepco. The remaining $31 million will be used to offset incremental expenses associated with direct load control and other programs. In 2010, Pepco received award payments of $15 million. The Internal Revenue Service has announced that, to the extent these grants are expended on capital items, they will not be considered taxable income. Transmission and Distribution The projected capital expenditures listed in the table for distribution (other than Blueprint for the Future) and transmission (other than the Mid Atlantic Power Pathway (MAPP) project) are primarily for facility replacements and upgrades to accommodate customer growth and reliability. 96 Table of Contents PEPCO Blueprint for the Future Pepco has undertaken programs to install smart meters, further automate its electric distribution systems and enhance its communications infrastructure, which it refers to as the Blueprint for the Future. For a discussion of the Blueprint for the Future initiative, see Item 1, Business Description of Business Blueprint for the Future of this Form 10 K. The projected capital expenditures over the next five years are shown as Distribution Blueprint for the Future in the table above. MAPP Project PHI has under development the construction of a new 230 mile, 500 kilovolt interstate transmission line as part of PJMs regional transmission expansion plan. For a description of the MAPP project, see Item 1, Business Description of Business MAPP Project of this Form 10 K. The projected capital expenditures over the next five years are shown as Transmission MAPP in the table above. MAPP/DOE Loan Program To assist in the funding of the MAPP project, PHI has applied for a $684 million loan guarantee from the Department of Energy (DOE) for a substantial portion of the MAPP project, primarily the Calvert Cliffs to Indian River segment. The application has been made under a federal loan guarantee program for projects that employ innovative energy efficiency, renewable energy and advanced transmission and distribution technologies. If granted, PHI believes the guarantee could allow PHI to acquire financing at a lower cost than it would otherwise be able to obtain in the capital markets. Whether PHIs application will be granted and, if so, the amount of debt guaranteed is subject to the discretion of the DOE and the negotiation of terms that will satisfy the conditions of the guarantee program. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans Pepco participates in pension and postretirement benefit plans sponsored by PHI for its employees. While the plans have not experienced any significant impact in terms of liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the disruption of the capital and credit markets, the stock market declines in 2008 caused a decrease in the market value of benefit plan assets at the end of 2008. Pepco contributed zero and $170 million to the pension plan during 2010 and 2009, respectively. 97 Table of Contents PEPCO Forward Looking Statements Some of the statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are subject to the safe harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

General Overview DPL is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity in Delaware and portions of Maryland. DPL also provides Default Electricity Supply, which is the supply of electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territories who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier. Default Electricity Supply is known as Standard Offer Service (SOS) in both Delaware and Maryland. DPLs electricity distribution service territory covers approximately 5,000 square miles and has a population of approximately 1.3 million. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 66% of delivered electricity sales were to Delaware customers and approximately 34% were to Maryland customers. In northern Delaware, DPL also supplies and distributes natural gas to retail customers and provides transportation only services to retail customers that purchase natural gas from other suppliers. DPLs natural gas distribution service territory covers approximately 275 square miles and has a population of approximately 500,000. As a result of the implementation of a bill stabilization adjustment mechanism (BSA) for retail customers of DPL in Maryland in June 2007, DPL recognizes Maryland distribution revenue based on an approved distribution charge per customer. From a revenue recognition standpoint, this has the effect of decoupling distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period with the amount of power delivered during the period. As a consequence, the only factors that will cause distribution revenue in Maryland to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer. For customers to whom the BSA applies, changes in customer usage (such as due to weather conditions, energy prices, energy efficiency programs or other reasons) from period to period have no impact on reported distribution revenue. As a result of the BSA in Maryland, a Revenue Decoupling Adjustment is recorded representing either (i) a positive adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from Maryland retail distribution sales falls short of the revenue that DPL is entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer or (ii) a negative adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from such distribution sales exceeds the revenue that DPL is entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer. DPL is a wholly owned subsidiary of Conectiv, which is wholly owned by Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI or Pepco Holdings). Because PHI is a public utility holding company subject to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005), the relationship between PHI and DPL and certain activities of DPL are subject to the regulatory oversight of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) under PUHCA 2005. 100 Table of Contents DPL Results Of Operations The following results of operations discussion compares the year ended December 31, 2010 to the year ended December 31, 2009. All amounts in the tables (except sales and customers) are in millions of dollars. Electric Operating Revenue 2010 2009 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 375 $ 343 $ 32 Default Electricity Supply Revenue 768 769 (1 ) Other Electric Revenue 20 23 (3 ) Total Electric Operating Revenue $ 1,163 $ 1,135 $ 28 The table above shows the amount of Electric Operating Revenue earned that is subject to price regulation (Regulated Transmission & Distribution (T&D) Electric Revenue and Default Electricity Supply Revenue) and that which is not subject to price regulation (Other Electric Revenue). Regulated T&D Electric Revenue includes revenue from the distribution of electricity, including the distribution of Default Electricity Supply, to DPLs customers within its service territory at regulated rates. Regulated T&D Electric Revenue also includes transmission service revenue that DPL receives as a transmission owner from PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM) at rates regulated by FERC. Transmission rates are updated annually based on a FERC approved formula methodology. Default Electricity Supply Revenue is the revenue received from the supply of electricity by DPL at regulated rates to retail customers who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier, and which is also known as Standard Offer Service. The costs related to Default Electricity Supply are included in Purchased Energy. Default Electricity Supply Revenue also includes transmission enhancement credits that DPL receives as a transmission owner from PJM for approved regional transmission expansion plan costs. Other Electric Revenue includes work and services performed on behalf of customers, including other utilities, which is generally not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of pole attachments, late payment fees, and collection fees.

An increase of $7 million due to higher revenue as a result of warmer weather during the 2010 spring and summer months as compared to 2009. An increase of $5 million due to the implementation of the EmPower Maryland (a demand side management program) surcharge in March 2010 (which is substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Depreciation and Amortization). Default Electricity Supply Default Electricity Supply Revenue 2010 2009 Change Residential $ 577 $ 551 $ 26 Commercial and industrial 181 209 (28 ) Other 10 9 1 Total Default Electricity Supply Revenue $ 768 $ 769 $ (1 ) Default Electricity Supply Sales (GWh) 2010 2009 Change Residential 5,199 4,821 378 Commercial and industrial 1,954 2,050 (96 ) Other 37 42 (5 ) Total Default Electricity Supply Sales 7,190 6,913 277 Default Electricity Supply Customers (in thousands) 2010 2009 Change Residential 423 431 (8 ) Commercial and industrial 45 47 (2 ) Other 1 1 Total Default Electricity Supply Customers 469 479 (10 ) Default Electricity Supply Revenue decreased by $1 million primarily due to: A decrease of $31 million due to lower sales, primarily as a result of Delaware commercial and Maryland residential customer migration to competitive suppliers. A decrease of $31 million as a result of lower Default Electricity Supply rates. 102 Table of Contents DPL The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $37 million due to higher sales primarily as a result of warmer weather during the 2010 spring and summer months as compared to 2009. An increase of $22 million due to higher non weather related average customer usage. The following table shows the percentages of DPLs total distribution sales by jurisdiction that are derived from customers receiving Default Electricity Supply from DPL. Amounts are for the years ended December 31: 2010 2009 Sales to Delaware customers 53 % 51 % Sales to Maryland customers 63 % 63 % Natural Gas Operating Revenue 2010 2009 Change Regulated Gas Revenue $ 191 $ 228 $ (37 ) Other Gas Revenue 46 40 6 Total Natural Gas Operating Revenue $ 237 $ 268 $ (31 ) The table above shows the amounts of Natural Gas Operating Revenue from sources that are subject to price regulation (Regulated Gas Revenue) and those that generally are not subject to price regulation (Other Gas Revenue). Regulated Gas Revenue includes the revenue DPL receives from on system natural gas delivered sales and the transportation of natural gas for customers within its service territory at regulated rates. Other Gas Revenue includes off system natural gas sales and the short term release of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity not needed to serve customers. Off system sales are made possible when low demand for natural gas by regulated customers creates excess pipeline capacity.

A decrease of $14 million due to lower sales as a result of milder weather during the 2010 winter months as compared to 2009. Other Gas Revenue Other Gas Revenue increased by $6 million primarily due to higher revenue from off system sales resulting from: An increase of $4 million due to higher demand from electric generators and natural gas marketers. An increase of $2 million due to higher market prices. Operating Expenses Purchased Energy Purchased Energy consists of the cost of electricity purchased by DPL to fulfill its Default Electricity Supply obligation and, as such, is recoverable from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders. Purchased Energy decreased by $11 million to $740 million in 2010 from $751 million in 2009 primarily due to: A decrease of $20 million in deferred electricity expense primarily due to lower Default Electricity Supply Revenue rates, which resulted in a lower rate of recovery of Default Electricity Supply costs. A decrease of $20 million due to lower average electricity costs under Default Electricity Supply contracts. A decrease of $4 million primarily due to commercial and residential customer migration to competitive suppliers. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $33 million due to higher sales primarily as a result of warmer weather during the 2010 spring and summer months as compared to 2009. Gas Purchased Gas Purchased consists of the cost of natural gas purchased by DPL to fulfill its obligation to regulated natural gas customers and, as such, is recoverable from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders. It also includes the cost of natural gas purchased for off system sales. Total Gas Purchased decreased by $29 million to $164 million in 2010 from $193 million in 2009 primarily due to: A decrease of $17 million in deferred natural gas expense as a result of a lower rate of recovery of natural gas supply costs. A decrease of $12 million from the settlement of financial hedges entered into as part of DPLs hedge program for regulated natural gas. 104 Table of Contents DPL Other Operation and Maintenance Other Operation and Maintenance increased by $17 million to $255 million in 2010 from $238 million in 2009. Excluding an increase of $3 million primarily related to administrative expenses that are deferred and recoverable in Default Electricity Supply Revenue, Other Operation and Maintenance expense increased by $14 million. The $14 million increase was primarily due to: An increase of $6 million primarily due to higher corrective and preventative maintenance, and tree trimming costs. An increase of $4 million in emergency restoration costs primarily due to the February 2010 severe winter storms. A $4 million accrual in 2010 for estimated future environmental remediation costs related to a 1999 oil release at the Indian River generating facility then owned by DPL, as further discussed under Indian River Oil Release in Note (15), Commitments and Contingencies, to the financial statements of DPL. An increase of $2 million primarily due to system support and customer support services costs. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $5 million in employee related costs, primarily due to lower pension and other postretirement benefit expenses. Restructuring Charge With the ongoing wind down of the retail energy supply business of Pepco Energy Services and the disposition of Conectiv Energy, PHI is repositioning itself as a regulated transmission and distribution company. In connection with this repositioning, PHI commenced a comprehensive organizational review in the second quarter of 2010 to identify opportunities to streamline the organization and to achieve certain reductions in corporate overhead costs that are allocated to its operating segments. This review has resulted in the adoption of a restructuring plan. PHI began implementing the plan during the third quarter, identifying 164 employee positions that were eliminated during the fourth quarter of 2010. The plan also focuses on identifying additional cost reduction opportunities through process improvements and operational efficiencies. PHI currently estimates that the implementation of the plan will result in an annual reduction of approximately $28 million in corporate overhead costs. In connection with the plan, DPL recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, related to severance, pension, and health and welfare benefits to be provided to terminated employees. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and Amortization expense increased by $7 million to $83 million in 2010 from $76 million in 2009 primarily due to: An increase of $3 million in amortization of regulatory assets primarily due to the EmPower Maryland surcharge that became effective in March 2010 (which is substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue). An increase of $3 million due to utility plant additions. 105 Table of Contents DPL Other Income (Expenses) Other Expenses (which are net of Other Income) decreased by $5 million to a net expense of $37 million in 2010 from a net expense of $42 million in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to an increase of $3 million in income related to Allowance for Funds Used During Construction that is applied to capital projects. Income Tax Expense DPLs effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were 40.8% and 23.5%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate resulted primarily from the impact of a refund of state taxes DPL received in 2009. DPL received a refund of $6 million (after tax) of state income taxes and established a state tax benefit carryforward of $7 million (after tax), each related to a change in tax reporting for certain asset dispositions occurring in prior years. In addition, the effective tax rate increased in 2010 as a result of the November 2010 settlement PHI reached with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with respect to its Federal tax returns for the years 1996 to 2002. In connection with the settlement, PHI reallocated certain amounts on deposit with the IRS since 2006 among liabilities in the settlement years and subsequent years. In light of the settlement and reallocations, DPL has recalculated the estimated interest due for the tax years 1996 to 2002. The revised estimate has resulted in an additional $3 million (after tax) of estimated interest due to the IRS. This additional interest expense has been recorded in 2010 and is subject to adjustment when the IRS finalizes its calculation of the amount due. This expense was partially offset by the reversal of $2 million of previously recorded tax liabilities. Capital Requirements Sources of Capital DPL has a range of capital sources available, in addition to internally generated funds, to meet its long term and short term funding needs. The sources of long term funding include the issuance of mortgage bonds and other debt securities and bank financings, as well as the ability to issue preferred stock. Proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements, such as capital expenditures, and to repay or refinance existing indebtedness. DPL traditionally has used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs, including commercial paper, short term notes, bank lines of credit, and borrowings under the PHI money pool. Proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs, but may also be used to temporarily fund long term capital requirements. DPLs ability to generate funds from its operations and to access the capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties. Volatile and deteriorating financial market conditions, diminished liquidity and tightening credit may affect access to certain of DPLs potential funding sources. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10 K, for additional discussion of important factors that may have an effect on DPLs sources of capital. Debt Securities DPL has a Mortgage and Deed of Trust (the Mortgage) under which it issues First Mortgage Bonds. First Mortgage Bonds issued under the Mortgage are secured by a lien on substantially all of DPLs property, plant and equipment. The principal amount of First Mortgage Bonds that DPL may issue under the Mortgage is limited by the principal amount of retired First Mortgage Bonds and 60% of the lesser of the cost or fair value of new property additions that have not been used as the basis for the issuance of additional First Mortgage Bonds. DPL also has an Indenture under which it issues unsecured senior notes, medium term notes and Variable Rate Demand Bonds. To fund the construction of pollution control facilities, DPL also has from time to time issued tax exempt bonds, including tax exempt Variable Rate Demand Bonds, through a public agency, the proceeds of which are loaned to DPL by the agency. 106 Table of Contents DPL Information concerning the principal amount and terms of DPLs outstanding First Mortgage Bonds, senior notes, medium term notes and Variable Rate Demand Bonds, and tax exempt bonds issued for the benefit of DPL, as of December 31, 2010, is set forth in Note (11), Debt, to the financial statements of DPL set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Bank Financing As further discussed in Note (11), Debt, to the financial statements of DPL set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K, DPL participates in a $1.5 billon credit facility, along with PHI, Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco) and Atlantic City Electric Company (ACE). The facility, all or any portion of which may be used to obtain loans or to issue letters of credit, expires in 2012. DPLs credit limit under the facility is the lesser of $500 million and the maximum amount of debt DPL is permitted to have outstanding by its regulatory authorities, except that the aggregate amount of credit used by DPL, Pepco and ACE at any given time may not collectively exceed $625 million. Commercial Paper Program DPL maintains an ongoing commercial paper program of up to $500 million under which it can issue commercial paper with maturities of up to 270 days. The commercial paper is backed by DPLs borrowing capacity under the PHI $1.5 billion credit facility. Money Pool DPL participates in the money pool operated by PHI under authorization received from FERC. The money pool is a cash management mechanism used by PHI and eligible subsidiaries to manage their short term investment and borrowing requirements. PHI may invest in, but not borrow from, the money pool. Eligible subsidiaries with surplus cash may deposit those funds in the money pool. Deposits in the money pool are guaranteed by PHI. Eligible subsidiaries with cash requirements may borrow from the money pool. Borrowings from the money pool are unsecured. Depositors in the money pool receive, and borrowers from the money pool pay, an interest rate based primarily on PHIs short term borrowing rate. PHI deposits funds in the money pool to the extent that the pool has insufficient funds to meet the borrowing needs of its participants, which PHI may obtain from external sources. Regulatory Restrictions on Financing Activities DPLs long term financing activities (including the issuance of securities and the incurrence of debt) is subject to authorization by the Delaware Public Service Commission and the Maryland Public Service Commission. Through its periodic filings with the respective utility commissions, DPL generally seeks to maintain standing authority sufficient to cover its projected financing needs over a multi year period. Under the Federal Power Act, FERC has jurisdiction over the issuance of long term and short term securities of public utilities, but only if the issuance is not regulated by the state public utility commission in which the public utility is organized and operating. Under these provisions, DPL is required to obtain FERC authorization for the issuance of short term debt. Capital Expenditures DPLs capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2010, totaled $250 million. These expenditures were primarily related to capital costs associated with new customer services, distribution reliability and transmission. The expenditures also include an allocation by PHI of hardware and software expenditures that primarily benefit the Power Delivery business and are allocated to DPL when the assets are placed in service. 107 Table of Contents DPL The following table shows DPLs projected capital expenditures for the five year period 2011 through 2015. DPL expects to fund these expenditures through internally generated cash, external financing and capital contributions from PHI.

S. Department of Energy under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 in support of its Blueprint for the Future and other initiatives. Transmission and Distribution The projected capital expenditures listed in the table for distribution (other than Blueprint for the Future), transmission (other than the Mid Atlantic Power Pathway (MAPP) project) and natural gas are primarily for facility replacements and upgrades to accommodate customer growth and reliability. Blueprint for the Future DPL has undertaken programs to install smart meters, further automate its electric distribution systems and enhance its communications infrastructure, which it refers to as the Blueprint for the Future. For a discussion of the Blueprint for the Future initiative, see Item 1, Business Description of Business Blueprint for the Future of this Form 10 K. The projected capital expenditures over the next five years are shown as Distribution Blueprint for the Future in the table above. MAPP Project PHI has under development the construction of a new 230 mile, 500 kilovolt interstate transmission line as part of PJMs regional transmission expansion plan. For a description of the MAPP project, see Item 1, Business Description of Business MAPP Project of this Form 10 K. The projected capital expenditures over the next five years are shown as Transmission MAPP in the table above. MAPP/DOE Loan Program To assist in the funding of the MAPP project, PHI has applied for a $684 million loan guarantee from the Department of Energy (DOE) for a substantial portion of the MAPP project, primarily the Calvert Cliffs to Indian River segment. The application has been made under a federal loan guarantee program for projects that employ innovative energy efficiency, renewable energy and advanced transmission and distribution technologies. If granted, PHI believes the guarantee could allow PHI to acquire financing at a lower cost than it would otherwise be able to obtain in the capital markets. Whether PHIs application will be granted and, if so, the amount of debt guaranteed is subject to the discretion of the DOE and the negotiation of terms that will satisfy the conditions of the guarantee program. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans DPL participates in pension and postretirement benefit plans sponsored by PHI for its employees. While the plans have not experienced any significant impact in terms of liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the disruption of the capital and credit markets, the stock market declines in 2008 caused a decrease in the market value of benefit plan assets at the end of 2008. DPL contributed zero and $10 million to the pension plan during 2010 and 2009, respectively. 108 Table of Contents DPL Forward Looking Statements Some of the statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are subject to the safe harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

General Overview ACE is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity in southern New Jersey. ACE also provides Default Electricity Supply, which is the supply of electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territory who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier. Default Electricity Supply is known as Basic Generation Service (BGS) in New Jersey. ACEs service territory covers approximately 2,700 square miles and has a population of approximately 1.1 million. ACE is a wholly owned subsidiary of Conectiv, which is wholly owned by Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI or Pepco Holdings). Because PHI is a public utility holding company subject to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005), the relationship between PHI and ACE and certain activities of ACE are subject to the regulatory oversight of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) under PUHCA 2005. 111 Table of Contents ACE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following results of operations discussion compares the year ended December 31, 2010 to the year ended December 31, 2009. All amounts in the tables (except sales and customers) are in millions of dollars. Operating Revenue 2010 2009 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 415 $ 363 $ 52 Default Electricity Supply Revenue 998 970 28 Other Electric Revenue 17 18 (1 ) Total Operating Revenue $ 1,430 $ 1,351 $ 79 The table above shows the amount of Operating Revenue earned that is subject to price regulation (Regulated Transmission & Distribution (T&D) Electric Revenue and Default Electricity Supply Revenue) and that which is not subject to price regulation (Other Electric Revenue). Regulated T&D Electric Revenue includes revenue from the distribution of electricity, including the distribution of Default Electricity Supply, to ACEs customers within its service territory at regulated rates. Regulated T&D Electric Revenue also includes transmission service revenue that ACE receives as a transmission owner from PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM) at rates regulated by FERC. Transmission rates are updated annually based on a FERC approved formula methodology. Default Electricity Supply Revenue is the revenue received from the supply of electricity by ACE at regulated rates to retail customers who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive supplier, also known as Basic Generation Service (BGS). The costs related to Default Electricity Supply are included in Purchased Energy. Default Electricity Supply Revenue also includes revenue from Transition Bond Charges that ACE receives, and pays to Atlantic City Electric Transition Funding LLC (ACE Funding), to fund the principal and interest payments on Transition Bonds issued by ACE Funding and revenue in the form of transmission enhancement credits that ACE receives as a transmission owner from PJM for approved regional transmission expansion plan costs (Transmission Enhancement Credits). Other Electric Revenue includes work and services performed on behalf of customers, including other utilities, which is generally not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of pole attachments, late payment fees, and collection fees.

Regulated T&D Electric Sales (Gigawatt hours (GWh)) 2010 2009 Change Residential 4,691 4,280 411 Commercial and industrial 5,445 5,330 115 Other 49 49 Total Regulated T&D Electric Sales 10,185 9,659 526 Regulated T&D Electric Customers (in thousands) 2010 2009 Change Residential 482 481 1 Commercial and industrial 65 65 Other 1 1 Total Regulated T&D Electric Customers 548 547 1 Regulated T&D Electric Revenue increased by $52 million primarily due to: An increase of $17 million in transmission revenue primarily attributable to higher rates effective June 1, 2010 related to an increase in transmission plant investment. An increase of $17 million due to a distribution rate increase that became effective in June 2010. An increase of $13 million due to higher revenue primarily as a result of warmer weather during the 2010 spring and summer months as compared to 2009. An increase of $5 million due to higher non weather related average customer usage. Default Electricity Supply Default Electricity Supply Revenue 2010 2009 Change Residential $ 580 $ 514 $ 66 Commercial and industrial 243 316 (73 ) Other 175 140 35 Total Default Electricity Supply Revenue $ 998 $ 970 $ 28 Other Default Electricity Supply Revenue consists primarily of: (i) revenue from the resale in the PJM Regional Transmission Organization market of energy and capacity purchased under contracts with unaffiliated, non utility generators (NUGs), and (ii) revenue from Transmission Enhancement Credits. Default Electricity Supply Sales (GWh) 2010 2009 Change Residential 4,610 4,280 330 Commercial and industrial 1,967 2,681 (714 ) Other 46 49 (3 ) Total Default Electricity Supply Sales 6,623 7,010 (387 ) 113 Table of Contents ACE Default Electricity Supply Customers (in thousands) 2010 2009 Change Residential 458 481 (23 ) Commercial and industrial 56 62 (6 ) Other 1 (1 ) Total Default Electricity Supply Customers 514 544 (30 ) Default Electricity Supply Revenue increased by $28 million primarily due to: An increase of $40 million due to higher sales primarily as a result of warmer weather during the 2010 spring and summer months as compared to 2009. An increase of $29 million in wholesale energy and capacity revenues primarily due to higher market prices for the sale of electricity and capacity purchased from NUGs. An increase of $20 million due to higher non weather related average customer usage. An increase of $19 million as a result of higher Default Electricity Supply rates. An increase of $6 million due to an increase in revenue from Transmission Enhancement Credits. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $87 million due to lower sales, primarily as a result of commercial and industrial customer migration to competitive suppliers. Total Default Electricity Supply Revenue for the 2010 period includes an increase of $8 million in unbilled revenue attributable to ACEs BGS. Under the BGS terms approved by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU), ACE is entitled to recover from its customers all of its costs of providing BGS. If the costs of providing BGS exceed the BGS revenue, then the excess costs are deferred in Deferred Electric Service Costs. ACEs BGS unbilled revenue (which is the result of the recognition of revenue when the electricity is delivered, as opposed to when it is billed) is not included in the deferral calculation, and therefore has an impact on the results of operations in the period during which it is accrued. While the change in the amount of unbilled revenue from year to year typically is not significant, for the year ended December 31, 2010, BGS unbilled revenue increased by $8 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, which resulted in a $5 million increase in ACEs net income. The increase was primarily due to higher Default Electricity Supply rates and colder weather during the unbilled revenue period at the end of 2010 as compared to the corresponding period in 2009. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the percentages of ACEs total distribution sales that are derived from customers receiving Default Electricity Supply are 65% and 73%, respectively. 114 Table of Contents ACE Operating Expenses Purchased Energy Purchased Energy consists of the cost of electricity purchased by ACE to fulfill its Default Electricity Supply obligation and, as such, is recoverable from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders. Purchased Energy decreased by $46 million to $1,030 million in 2010 from $1,076 million in 2009 primarily due to: A decrease of $109 million due to lower sales, primarily due to commercial and industrial customer migration to competitive suppliers. The decrease was partially offset by: An increase of $49 million due to higher sales primarily as a result of warmer weather during the 2010 spring and summer months as compared to 2009. An increase of $14 million due to higher average electricity costs under Default Electricity Supply contracts. Other Operation and Maintenance Other Operation and Maintenance increased by $14 million to $204 million in 2010 from $190 million in 2009. Excluding an increase of $6 million primarily related to bad debt expenses and New Jersey Societal Benefit Program costs that are deferred and recoverable, Other Operation and Maintenance expense increased by $8 million. The $8 million increase was primarily due to: An increase of $7 million in emergency restoration costs primarily due to the severe winter storms in February 2010. An increase of $5 million due to higher tree trimming costs. An increase of $2 million due to an adjustment for non recoverable litigation costs related to ACEs former interests in certain nuclear generating facilities in accordance with a May 2010 settlement approved by the NJBPU. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $6 million in employee related costs, primarily due to lower pension and other postretirement benefit expenses. Restructuring Charge With the ongoing wind down of the retail energy supply business of Pepco Energy Services and the disposition of Conectiv Energy, PHI is repositioning itself as a regulated transmission and distribution company. In connection with this repositioning, PHI commenced a comprehensive organizational review in the second quarter of 2010 to identify opportunities to streamline the organization and to achieve certain reductions in corporate overhead costs that are allocated to its operating segments. This review has resulted in the adoption of a restructuring plan. PHI began implementing the plan during the third quarter, identifying 164 employee positions that were eliminated during the fourth quarter of 2010. The plan also focuses on identifying additional cost reduction opportunities through process improvements and operational efficiencies. PHI currently estimates that the implementation of the plan will result in an annual reduction of approximately $28 million in corporate overhead costs. 115 Table of Contents ACE In connection with the plan, ACE recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, related to severance, pension, and health and welfare benefits to be provided to terminated employees. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and Amortization expense increased by $10 million to $112 million in 2010 from $102 million in 2009 primarily due to higher amortization of stranded costs as the result of higher revenues due to increases in sales (partially offset in Default Electricity Supply Revenue). Deferred Electric Service Costs Deferred Electric Service Costs represent (i) the over or under recovery of electricity costs incurred by ACE to fulfill its Default Electricity Supply obligation and (ii) the over or under recovery of New Jersey Societal Benefit Program costs incurred by ACE. The cost of electricity purchased is reported under Purchased Energy and the corresponding revenue is reported under Default Electricity Supply Revenue. The cost of New Jersey Societal Benefit Programs is reported under Other Operation and Maintenance and the corresponding revenue is reported under Regulated T&D Electric Revenue. Deferred Electric Service Costs increased by $53 million, to an expense reduction of $108 million in 2010 as compared to an expense reduction of $161 million in 2009, primarily due to an increase in deferred electricity expense as a result of lower electricity supply costs and higher Default Electricity Supply Revenue rates. Income Tax Expense ACEs consolidated effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were 44.8% and 29.3%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate resulted primarily from two reversals of previously accrued interest on uncertain and effectively settled tax positions. The first reversal was the result of the November 2010 settlement PHI reached with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with respect to its federal tax returns for the years 1996 to 2002. In connection with the settlement, PHI reallocated certain amounts on deposit with the IRS since 2006 among liabilities in the settlement years and subsequent years. In light of the settlement and reallocations, ACE has recalculated the estimated interest due for the tax years 1996 to 2002. The revised estimate has resulted in an additional $1 million (after tax) of estimated interest due to the IRS. This additional interest expense has been recorded in 2010 and is subject to adjustment when the IRS finalizes its calculation of the amount due. The second reversal of $6 million of accrued interest income was recorded in 2010 to eliminate interest on uncertain and effectively settled state income tax positions that had been erroneously accrued in prior periods. Capital Requirements Sources of Capital ACE has a range of capital sources available, in addition to internally generated funds, to meet its long term and short term funding needs. The sources of long term funding include the issuance of mortgage bonds and other debt securities and bank financings, as well as preferred stock. Proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements, such as capital expenditures, and to repay or refinance existing indebtedness. ACE traditionally has used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs, including commercial paper, short term notes, bank lines of credit, and borrowings under the PHI money pool. Proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs, but may also be used to temporarily fund long term capital requirements. ACEs ability to generate funds from its operations and to access the capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties. Volatile and deteriorating financial market conditions, diminished liquidity and tightening credit may affect access to certain of ACEs potential funding sources. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10 K, for additional discussion of important factors that may have an effect on ACEs sources of capital. 116 Table of Contents ACE Debt Securities ACE has a Mortgage and Deed of Trust (the Mortgage) under which it issues First Mortgage Bonds. First Mortgage Bonds issued under the Mortgage are secured by a lien on substantially all of ACEs property, plant and equipment. The principal amount of First Mortgage Bonds that ACE may issue under the Mortgage is limited by the principal amount of retired First Mortgage Bonds and 65% of the lesser of the cost or fair value of new property additions that have not been used as the basis for the issuance of additional First Mortgage Bonds. ACE also has an Indenture under which it issues senior notes secured by First Mortgage Bonds and an Indenture under which it can issue unsecured debt securities, including Variable Rate Demand Bonds. To fund the construction of pollution control facilities, ACE also has from time to time issued tax exempt bonds, including tax exempt Variable Rate Demand Bonds, through a municipality, the proceeds of which are loaned to ACE by the municipality. Information concerning the principal amount and terms of ACEs outstanding First Mortgage Bonds, senior notes and Variable Rate Demand Bonds, and tax exempt bonds issued for the benefit of ACE, as of December 31, 2010, is set forth in Note (10), Debt, to the consolidated financial statements of ACE set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Bank Financing As further discussed in Note (10), Debt, to the consolidated financial statements of ACE set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K, ACE participates in a $1.5 billion credit facility, along with PHI, Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco) and Delmarva Power & Light Company (DPL). The facility, all or any portion of which may be used to obtain loans or to issue letters of credit expires in 2012. ACEs credit limit under the facility is the lesser of $500 million and the maximum amount of debt ACE is permitted to have outstanding by its regulatory authorities, except that the aggregate amount of credit used by ACE, Pepco and DPL at any given time may not collectively exceed $625 million. Commercial Paper Program ACE maintains an ongoing commercial paper program of up to $250 million under which it can issue commercial paper with maturities of up to 270 days. The commercial paper is backed by ACEs borrowing capacity under the PHI $1.5 billion credit facility. Money Pool ACE participates in the money pool operated by PHI under authorization received from the NJBPU. The money pool is a cash management mechanism used by PHI and eligible subsidiaries to manage their short term investment and borrowing requirements. PHI may invest in, but not borrow from, the money pool. Eligible subsidiaries with surplus cash may deposit those funds in the money pool. Deposits in the money pool are guaranteed by PHI. Eligible subsidiaries with cash requirements may borrow from the money pool. Borrowings from the money pool are unsecured. Depositors in the money pool receive, and borrowers from the money pool pay, an interest rate based primarily on PHIs short term borrowing rate. PHI deposits funds in the money pool to the extent that the pool has insufficient funds to meet the borrowing needs of its participants, which PHI may obtain from external sources. By regulatory order, the NJBPU has restricted ACEs participation in the PHI money pool. ACE may not invest in the money pool, but may borrow from it if the rates are lower than the rates at which ACE could borrow funds externally. 117 Table of Contents ACE Preferred Stock Under its Certificate of Incorporation, ACE is authorized to issue and have outstanding up to (i) 799,979 shares of Cumulative Preferred Stock, (ii) 2 million shares of No Par Preferred Stock and (iii) 3 million shares of Preference Stock, each such type of preferred stock having such terms and conditions as are set forth in or authorized by the Certificate of Incorporation. Information concerning the numbers of shares and the terms of ACEs outstanding shares of Cumulative Preferred Stock as of December 31, 2010, is set forth in Note (12), Preferred Stock, to the consolidated financial statements of ACE set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. As of December 31, 2010, ACE had issued $6 million of Cumulative Preferred Stock that will be redeemed on February 25, 2011. No shares of No Par Preferred Stock or Preference Stock were outstanding at December 31, 2010. Regulatory Restrictions on Financing Activities ACEs long term and short term (consisting of debt instruments with a maturity of one year or less) financing activities are subject to authorization by the NJBPU. Through its periodic filings with the NJBPU, ACE generally seeks to maintain standing authority sufficient to cover its projected financing needs over a multi year period. ACEs long term and short term financing activities do not require FERC approval. State corporate laws impose limitations on the funds that can be used to pay dividends. In addition, ACE must obtain the approval of the NJBPU before dividends can be paid if its equity as a percent of its total capitalization, excluding securitization debt, falls below 30%. Capital Expenditures ACEs capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2010, totaled $156 million. These expenditures were primarily related to capital costs associated with new customer services, distribution reliability and transmission. The expenditures also include an allocation by PHI of hardware and software expenditures that primarily benefit the Power Delivery business and are allocated to ACE when the assets are placed in service. The following table shows ACEs updated projected capital expenditures for the five year period 2011 through 2015. ACE expects to fund these expenditures through internally generated cash, external financing and capital contributions from PHI. For the Year 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Total (millions of dollars) ACE Distribution $ 107 $ 101 $ 108 $ 112 $ 114 $ 542 Distribution Blueprint for the Future 4 8 92 104 Transmission 33 32 35 25 27 152 Other 20 13 16 13 15 77 Sub Total 164 146 167 242 156 875 DOE Capital Reimbursement Awards (a) (5 ) (4 ) (1 ) (10 ) Total ACE $ 159 $ 142 $ 166 $ 242 $ 156 $ 865 (a) Reflects anticipated reimbursements pursuant to awards from the U.S. Department of Energy under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. 118 Table of Contents ACE Stimulus Funds Related to Blueprint for the Future In 2009, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced a $168 million award to PHI under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for the implementation of an advanced metering infrastructure system, direct load control, distribution automation, and communications infrastructure, of which $19 million was for ACEs service territory. In April 2010, PHI and the DOE signed agreements formalizing ACEs $19 million share of the $168 million award. Of the $19 million, $12 million is expected to offset incurred and projected Blueprint for the Future and other capital expenditures of ACE. The remaining $7 million will be used to offset incremental expenses associated with direct load control and other programs. In 2010, ACE received award payments of $2 million. The Internal Revenue Service has announced that, to the extent these grants are expended on capital items, they will not be considered taxable income. Transmission and Distribution The projected capital expenditures listed in the table for distribution (other than Blueprint for the Future) and transmission are primarily for facility replacements and upgrades to accommodate customer growth and reliability. Blueprint for the Future ACE has undertaken programs to install smart meters, further automate its electric distribution systems and enhance its communications infrastructure, which it refers to as the Blueprint for the Future. For a discussion of the Blueprint for the Future initiative, see Item 1, Business Description of Business Blueprint for the Future of this Form 10 K. The projected capital expenditures over the next five years are shown as Distribution Blueprint for the Future in the table above. Infrastructure Investment Plan In 2009, the NJBPU approved ACEs proposed Infrastructure Investment Plan and the revenue requirement associated with recovering the cost of the related projects, subject to a prudency review in the next rate case. The approved projects are designed to enhance reliability of ACEs distribution system and support economic activity and job growth in New Jersey in the near term. ACE will achieve cost recovery through an Infrastructure Investment Surcharge, which became effective on June 1, 2009. This approved plan added incremental capital spending of approximately $8 million for 2009 and $19 million for 2010, and is expected to add an additional $1 million of capital spending for 2011, which is included in Distribution in the table above. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans ACE participates in pension and postretirement benefit plans sponsored by PHI for its employees. While the plans have not experienced any significant impact in terms of liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the disruption of the capital and credit markets, the stock market declines in 2008 caused a decrease in the market value of benefit plan assets at the end of 2008. ACE contributed zero and $60 million to the pension plan during 2010 and 2009, respectively. 119 Table of Contents ACE Forward Looking Statements Some of the statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are subject to the safe harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Risk management policies for PHI and its subsidiaries are determined by PHIs Corporate Risk Management Committee, the members of which are PHIs Chief Risk Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Chief Information Officer and other senior executives. The Corporate Risk Management Committee monitors interest rate fluctuation, commodity price fluctuation, and credit risk exposure, and sets risk management policies that establish limits on unhedged risk and determine risk reporting requirements. For information about PHIs derivative activities, other than the information disclosed herein, refer to Note (2), Significant Accounting Policies Accounting For Derivatives, Note (15), Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and Note (20), Discontinued Operations to the consolidated financial statements of PHI set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Pepco Holdings, Inc. Commodity Price Risk The Pepco Energy Services segment engages in commodity risk management activities to reduce their financial exposure to changes in the value of their assets and obligations due to commodity price fluctuations. Certain of these risk management activities are conducted using instruments classified as derivatives based on Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidance on derivatives and hedging (Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 815). Pepco Energy Services also manages commodity risk with contracts that are not classified as derivatives. The primary risk management objective is to manage the spread between wholesale and retail sales commitments and the cost of supply used to service those commitments in order to ensure stable and known cash flows and fix favorable prices and margins. The discontinued operations of Conectiv Energy have engaged in similar commodity risk management activities throughout 2010. Prior to the sale of the wholesale power generation business on July 1, 2010, the risk management objective of the Conectiv Energy segment also included the management of the spread between the cost of fuel used to operate its electric generating facilities and the revenue received from the sale of the power produced by those facilities by selling forward a portion of their projected generating facility output and buying forward a portion of their projected fuel supply requirements. Conectiv Energy sold its remaining derivatives in January 2011, and no longer engages in such activities. PHIs risk management policies place oversight at the senior management level through the Corporate Risk Management Committee, which has the responsibility for establishing corporate compliance requirements for energy market participation. PHI collectively refers to these energy market activities, including its commodity risk management activities, as energy commodity activities. PHI uses a value at risk (VaR) model to assess the market risk of the energy commodity activities of Pepco Energy Services and Conectiv Energy. PHI also uses other measures to limit and monitor risk in its energy commodity activities, including limits on the nominal size of positions and periodic loss limits. VaR represents the potential fair value loss on energy contracts or portfolios due to changes in market prices for a specified time period and confidence level. In January 2009, PHI changed its VaR estimation model from a delta normal variance / covariance model to a delta gamma model. The other parameters, a 95 percent, one tailed confidence level and a one day holding period, remained the same. Since VaR is an estimate, it is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur. 122 Table of Contents The table below provides the VaR associated with energy contracts of both the Pepco Energy Services segment and the former Conectiv Energy segment for the year ended December 31, 2010 in millions of dollars: VaR forConectivEnergyCommodityActivities (a) VaR forPepcoEnergyServicesCommodityActivities (a) 95% confidence level, one day holding period, one tailed Period end $ $ 3 Average for the period $ 2 $ 1 High $ 5 $ 3 Low $ $ 1 (a) These columns represent all energy derivative contracts, normal purchase and normal sales contracts, modeled generation output and fuel requirements, and modeled customer load obligations for PHIs energy commodity activities. Pepco Energy Services purchases electric and natural gas futures, swaps, options and forward contracts to hedge price risk in connection with the purchase of physical natural gas and electricity for distribution to customers. Pepco Energy Services accounts for its futures and swap contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions. Its options contracts and certain commodity contracts that do not qualify as cash flow hedges are marked to market through current earnings. Forward contracts that meet the requirements for normal purchase and normal sale accounting under FASB guidance on derivatives and hedging are accounted for using accrual accounting. Credit and Nonperformance Risk Pepco Holdings subsidiaries attempt to minimize credit risk exposure to wholesale energy counterparties through, among other things, formal credit policies, regular assessment of counterparty creditworthiness and the establishment of a credit limit for each counterparty, monitoring procedures that include stress testing, the use of standard agreements which allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty and collateral requirements under certain circumstances, and have established reserves for credit losses. As of December 31, 2010, credit exposure to wholesale energy counterparties was weighted 99% with investment grade counterparties, 1% with counterparties without external credit quality ratings, and there were no investments with non investment grade counterparties. 123 Table of Contents The following table provides information on the credit exposure on competitive wholesale energy contracts, net of collateral, to wholesale counterparties as of December 31, 2010, in millions of dollars: Rating Exposure BeforeCreditCollateral (b) CreditCollateral (c) NetExposure Number ofCounterpartiesGreater Than10% (d) Net Exposure ofCounterpartiesGreaterThan 10% Investment Grade (a) $ 74 $ $ 74 5 $ 53 Non Investment Grade No External Ratings 1 1 Credit reserves 1 (a) Investment Grade primarily determined using publicly available credit ratings of the counterparty. If the counterparty has provided a guarantee by a higher rated entity (e.g., its parent), it is determined based upon the rating of its guarantor. Included in Investment Grade are counterparties with a minimum Standard & Poors or Moodys Investor Service rating of BBB or Baa3, respectively. (b) Exposure before credit collateral includes the marked to market (MTM) energy contract net assets for open/unrealized transactions, the net receivable/payable for realized transactions and net open positions for contracts not subject to MTM. Amounts due from counterparties are offset by liabilities payable to those counterparties to the extent that legally enforceable netting arrangements are in place. Thus, this column presents the net credit exposure to counterparties after reflecting all allowable netting, but before considering collateral held. (c) Credit collateral the face amount of cash deposits, letters of credit and performance bonds received from counterparties, not adjusted for probability of default, and, if applicable, property interests (including oil and natural gas reserves). (d) Using a percentage of the total exposure. Interest Rate Risk Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries variable or floating rate debt is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. Pepco Holdings manages interest rates through the use of fixed and, to a lesser extent, variable rate debt. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates on the annual interest costs for short term and variable rate debt was less than $1 million as of December 31, 2010. Potomac Electric Power Company Interest Rate Risk Pepco does not have any debt with variable or floating rates. Delmarva Power & Light Company Commodity Price Risk DPL uses derivative instruments (forward contracts, futures, swaps, and exchange traded and over the counter options) primarily to reduce natural gas commodity price volatility while limiting its customers exposure to increases in the market price of natural gas. DPL also manages commodity risk with capacity contracts that do not meet the definition of derivatives. The primary goal of these activities is to reduce the exposure of its regulated retail natural gas customers to natural gas price spikes. All premiums paid and other transaction costs incurred as part of DPLs natural gas hedging activity, in addition to all gains and losses on the natural gas hedging activity, are fully recoverable through the Gas Cost Rate clause included in DPLs natural gas tariff rates approved by the Delaware Public Service Commission and are deferred until recovered. At December 31, 2010, after the effects of cash collateral and netting, DPL had a net derivative liability of $23 million, offset by a $31 million regulatory asset. At December 31, 2009, after the effects of cash collateral and netting, DPL had a net derivative liability of $28 million, offset by a $42 million regulatory asset. 124 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk DPLs debt is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. DPL manages interest rates through the use of fixed and, to a lesser extent, variable rate debt. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates on the annual interest costs for short term debt and variable rate debt was less than $1 million as of December 31, 2010. Atlantic City Electric Company Interest Rate Risk ACEs debt is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. ACE manages interest rates through the use of fixed and, to a lesser extent, variable rate debt. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates on the annual interest costs for short term debt and variable rate debt was less than $1 million as of December 31, 2010. 125 Table of Contents
