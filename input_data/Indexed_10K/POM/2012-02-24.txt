Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The information required by this item is contained herein, as follows: Registrants Page No. Pepco Holdings 45 Pepco 95 DPL 105 ACE 116 44 PEPCO HOLDINGS MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Pepco Holdings, Inc. General Overview PHI, a Delaware corporation incorporated in 2001, is a holding company that, through its regulated public utility subsidiaries, is engaged primarily in the transmission, distribution and default supply of electricity and the distribution and supply of natural gas (Power Delivery). Through Pepco Energy Services, PHI provides energy efficiency services primarily to government and institutional customers and is in the process of winding down its competitive electricity and natural gas retail supply business. Each of Power Delivery and Pepco Energy Services constitutes a separate segment for financial reporting purposes. A third segment, Other Non Regulated, owns a portfolio of seven cross border energy lease investments. The following table sets forth the percentage contributions to consolidated operating revenue and operating income from continuing operations attributable to the Power Delivery, Pepco Energy Services and Other Non Regulated segments: December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Percentage of Consolidated Operating Revenue Power Delivery 79 % 73 % 67 % Pepco Energy Services 21 % 27 % 32 % Other Non Regulated % % 1 % Percentage of Consolidated Operating Income Power Delivery 78 % 81 % 78 % Pepco Energy Services 5 % 11 % 14 % Other Non Regulated 17 % 8 % 8 % Percentage of Power Delivery Operating Revenue Power Delivery Electric 95 % 95 % 95 % Power Delivery Gas 5 % 5 % 5 % Power Delivery Power Delivery Electric consists primarily of the transmission, distribution and default supply of electricity, and Power Delivery Gas consists of the delivery and supply of natural gas. Power Delivery represents a single operating segment for financial reporting purposes. Each utility comprising Power Delivery is a regulated public utility in the jurisdictions that encompass its service territory. Each company is responsible for the distribution of electricity and, in the case of DPL, natural gas in its service territory, for which it is paid tariff rates established by the applicable local public service commission in each jurisdiction. Each company also supplies electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territory who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier. The regulatory term for this supply service is SOS in Delaware, the District of Columbia and Maryland, and BGS in New Jersey. In this report, these supply service obligations are referred to generally as Default Electricity Supply. Pepco, DPL and ACE are also responsible for the transmission of wholesale electricity into and across their service territories. The rates each company is permitted to charge for the wholesale transmission of electricity are regulated by FERC. Transmission rates are updated annually based on a FERC approved formula methodology. 45 PEPCO HOLDINGS The profitability of Power Delivery depends on its ability to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on its capital investments through the rates it is permitted to charge. Operating results also can be affected by economic conditions, energy prices and the impact of energy efficiency measures on customer usage of electricity. In ACE and DPLs Delaware service territories, results historically have been seasonal, generally producing higher revenue and income in the warmest and coldest periods of the year. For retail customers of Pepco and DPL in Maryland and for customers of Pepco in the District of Columbia, revenue is not affected by season changes because a BSA was implemented for retail customers that provides for a fixed distribution charge per customer rather than a charge based upon energy usage. The BSA has the effect of decoupling the distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period. As a result, the only factors that will cause distribution revenue in Maryland and the District of Columbia to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer. A comparable revenue decoupling mechanism for DPL electricity and natural gas customers in Delaware is under consideration by the DPSC. With respect to customers subject to a BSA, changes in usage (such as due to weather conditions, energy prices, energy efficiency programs or other reasons) from period to period have no impact on reported distribution revenue. In accounting for the BSA in Maryland and the District of Columbia, a Revenue Decoupling Adjustment is recorded representing either (i) a positive adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from Maryland and District of Columbia retail distribution sales falls short of the revenue that Pepco and DPL are entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer or (ii) a negative adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from such distribution sales exceeds the revenue that Pepco and DPL are entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer. The following are developments in some of the key initiatives of Power Delivery in 2011: Reliability Enhancement and Emergency Restoration Improvement Plans In 2010, PHI announced that Pepco had adopted and begun to implement comprehensive reliability enhancement plans in Maryland and the District of Columbia. These reliability enhancement plans include various initiatives to improve electrical system reliability, such as: enhanced vegetation management; the identification and upgrading of under performing feeder lines; the addition of new facilities to support load; the installation of distribution automation systems on both the overhead and underground network system; the rejuvenation and replacement of underground residential cables; improvements to substation supply lines; and selective undergrounding of portions of existing above ground primary feeder lines, where appropriate to improve reliability. During 2011, Pepco invested $120 million in capital expenditures on these reliability enhancement activities. In 2011, prior to the start of the summer storm season, PHI initiated a program to improve Pepcos emergency restoration efforts that included, among other initiatives, an expansion and enhancement of customer service capabilities. PHI has extended its reliability enhancement efforts to DPL and ACE. PHIs capital expenditures for continuing reliability enhancement efforts are included in the table of projected capital expenditures in the section titled Capital Resources and Liquidity Capital Expenditures. 46 PEPCO HOLDINGS Blueprint for the Future Each of PHIs three utilities is participating in a PHI initiative referred to as Blueprint for the Future. The installation of smart meters (also known as AMI), a key initiative of Blueprint for the Future, is almost complete for DPL electric customers in Delaware, with meter activation expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2012. Meter installation is still underway for Pepco customers in both the District of Columbia and Maryland, with installation of residential meters expected to be complete in the first and fourth quarters of 2012, respectively. The respective public service commissions have approved the creation of regulatory assets to defer AMI costs between rate cases, as well as the accrual of a return on the deferred costs. Thus, these costs will be recovered through base rates in the future. In addition to the replacement of existing meters, the AMI system involves the construction of a wireless network across the service territories of PHIs utility subsidiaries and the implementation and integration of new and existing information technology systems to collect and manage data made available by the advanced meters. The implementation of the AMI system involves a combination of technologies provided by multiple vendors. Approval of AMI is still pending for electric customers in DPLs Maryland jurisdiction, and has been deferred in New Jersey. In 2011, the DPSC approved DPLs request to implement dynamic pricing for its Delaware customers. Implementation for customers will be phased in between 2012 and 2014. Dynamic pricing has been approved in concept, with phase in for residential customers beginning in 2012 for Pepco customers in Maryland. Customers in Pepcos District of Columbia jurisdiction have proposals pending with proposed phase in for residential customers anticipated to begin in 2012. Dynamic pricing has been approved in concept pending AMI deployment authorization for DPLs Maryland customers and has been deferred for ACEs customers in New Jersey. Regulatory Lag An important factor in the ability of each of Pepco, DPL and ACE to earn its authorized rate of return is the willingness of applicable public service commissions to adequately recognize forward looking costs in the utilitys rate structure in order to address the shortfall in revenues due to the delay in time or lag between when costs are incurred and when they are reflected in rates. This delay is commonly known as regulatory lag. Each of Pepco, DPL and ACE is currently experiencing significant regulatory lag because their investment in the rate base and their operating expenses are outpacing revenue growth. PHI is continuing to seek cost recovery and tracking mechanisms from applicable public service commissions to reduce the effects of regulatory lag. Pepco Energy Services Pepco Energy Services is engaged in the following businesses: providing energy efficiency services principally to federal, state and local government customers, and designing, constructing and operating combined heat and power and central energy plants. providing high voltage electric construction and maintenance services to customers throughout the United States and low voltage electric construction and maintenance services and streetlight construction and asset management services to utilities, municipalities and other customers in the Washington, D.C. area. 47 PEPCO HOLDINGS Pepco Energy Services also has been engaged in the business of providing retail energy supply services, consisting of the sale of electricity, including electricity from renewable resources, primarily to commercial, industrial and government customers located primarily in the mid Atlantic and northeastern regions of the U.S., as well as Texas and Illinois, and the sale of natural gas to customers located primarily in the mid Atlantic region. In December 2009, PHI announced that it will wind down the retail energy supply component of the Pepco Energy Services business. The decision was made after considering, among other factors, the return PHI earns by investing capital in the retail energy supply business as compared to alternative investments. To effectuate the wind down, Pepco Energy Services will continue to fulfill all of its commercial and regulatory obligations and perform its customer service functions to ensure that it meets the needs of its existing customers, but will not be entering into any new retail energy supply contracts. Operating revenues related to the retail energy supply business for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $0.9 billion, $1.6 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, and operating income for the same periods was $11 million, $59 million and $88 million, respectively. PHI expects the operating results of the retail energy supply business, excluding the effects of unrealized mark to market gains or losses on derivatives contracts, to be profitable in 2012, based on its existing retail contracts and its corresponding portfolio of wholesale hedges, with immaterial losses beyond that date. Substantially all of Pepco Energy Services retail customer obligations will be fully performed by June 1, 2014. In connection with the operation of the retail energy supply business, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, Pepco Energy Services had collateral pledged to counterparties primarily for the instruments it uses to hedge commodity price risk of approximately $113 million and $230 million, respectively. The collateral pledged as of December 31, 2011, included $1 million in the form of letters of credit and $112 million posted in cash. Pepco Energy Services estimates that at current market prices, with the wind down of the retail energy supply business, an aggregate of 80% of the collateral will no longer need to be pledged by December 31, 2012, and substantially all collateral will no longer need to be pledged by June 1, 2014. As a result of the decision to wind down the retail energy supply business, Pepco Energy Services in the fourth quarter of 2009 recorded (i) a $4 million pre tax impairment charge reflecting the write off of all goodwill allocated to the business and (ii) a pre tax charge of less than $1 million related to employee severance. Pepco Energy Services remaining businesses will not be affected by the wind down of the retail energy supply business. Other Non Regulated Through its subsidiary PCI, PHI maintains a portfolio of cross border energy lease investments with a book value at December 31, 2011 of approximately $1.3 billion. This activity constitutes a third operating segment, which is designated as Other Non Regulated, for financial reporting purposes. For a discussion of PHIs cross border energy lease investments, see Note (8), Leasing Activities Investment in Finance Leases Held in Trust, and Note (17), Commitments and Contingencies PHIs Cross Border Energy Lease Investments, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI. Discontinued Operations On April 20, 2010, the Board of Directors of PHI approved a plan for the disposition of Conectiv Energy. On July 1, 2010, PHI completed the sale of Conectiv Energys wholesale power generation business to Calpine for $1.64 billion. The disposition of all of Conectiv Energys remaining assets and businesses not 48 PEPCO HOLDINGS included in the Calpine sale, including its load service supply contracts, energy hedging portfolio and certain tolling agreements, has been substantially completed. The operations of Conectiv Energy, which previously comprised a separate segment for financial reporting purposes, have been classified as a discontinued operation in PHIs consolidated financial statements for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, and the business is no longer being treated as a separate segment for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, all references to continuing operations exclude the operations of the former Conectiv Energy segment. Earnings Overview Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 PHIs net income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $260 million, or $1.15 per share, compared to $139 million, or $0.62 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2010. Net income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2010, included the charges set forth below in the business segments noted which are presented net of federal and state income taxes (assuming a composite tax rate of approximately 40%) and are in millions of dollars: Debt extinguishment costs including treasury lock hedge (Corporate and Other) $ 113 Restructuring charge (All segments) $ 18 Effects of Pepco divestiture related claims (Power Delivery) $ 6 Excluding these items, net income from continuing operations would have been $276 million, or $1.24 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2010. PHI discloses net income from continuing operations and related per share data excluding these items because management believes that these items are not representative of PHIs ongoing business operations. Management uses this information, and believes that such information is useful to investors, in evaluating PHIs period over period performance. The inclusion of this disclosure is intended to complement, and should not be considered as an alternative to, PHIs reported net income from continuing operations and related per share data in accordance with GAAP. PHIs net loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $3 million, or $0.01 per share, compared to a net loss of $107 million, or $0.48 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2010. PHIs net income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, by operating segment, is set forth in the table below (in millions of dollars): 2011 2010 Change Power Delivery $ 210 $ 206 $ 4 Pepco Energy Services 24 36 (12 ) Other Non Regulated 35 25 10 Corporate and Other (9 ) (128 ) 119 Net Income from Continuing Operations 260 139 121 Discontinued Operations (3 ) (107 ) 104 Total PHI Net Income $ 257 $ 32 $ 225 49 PEPCO HOLDINGS Discussion of Operating Segment Net Income Variances: Power Deliverys $4 million increase in earnings was primarily due to the following: $23 million increase from higher distribution revenue primarily due to Regulated T&D Electric and Regulated Gas distribution rate increases. $18 million increase associated with higher Default Electricity Supply margins, primarily resulting from an approval by the DCPSC of an increase in Pepcos cost recovery rate for providing SOS in the District of Columbia, and adjustments to Pepco and DPL operating and maintenance expenses for providing SOS. $17 million increase from higher transmission revenue primarily attributable to higher rates effective June 1, 2010 and June 1, 2011, related to increases in transmission plant investment. $17 million increase due to a restructuring charge related to severance, pension and health and welfare benefits for employee terminations, associated with the reorganization of PHI in 2010. $6 million increase due to an order by the DCPSC in 2010 associated with the effects of Pepco divestiture related claims. $56 million decrease due to higher operating and maintenance expenses primarily from increased system preventative maintenance and reliability activities. $10 million decrease in distribution revenues due to lower usage, including the effect of milder weather. $8 million decrease due to higher depreciation expense. Pepco Energy Services $12 million decrease in earnings was primarily due to mark to market losses of $18 million in 2011 on derivative contracts, lower earnings as a result of the ongoing wind down of the retail energy supply business and lower capacity revenues from the generating facilities, partially offset by higher operating income from the energy services business. Other Non Regulateds $10 million increase in earnings was primarily due to favorable income tax adjustments and the gain on the early termination of certain cross border energy leases, partially offset by lower financial investment portfolio activity (as further discussed in Note (8), Leasing Activities Investment in Finance Leases Held in Trust, and Note (12), Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI. Corporate and Others $119 million decrease in loss was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of debt extinguishment costs in 2010 and lower interest expense in 2011 as a result of the reduction in outstanding debt due to the retirement of debt with the Conectiv Energy sale proceeds, partially offset by favorable income tax adjustments in 2010 from the release of certain deferred tax valuation allowances related to state net operating losses. The $104 million decrease in the net loss from discontinued operations was primarily due to the 2010 write down associated with the sale of the wholesale power generation business to Calpine and unrealized losses on derivative instruments no longer qualifying for cash flow hedge accounting, partially offset by gains in the 2010 period from sales of load service supply contracts. 50 PEPCO HOLDINGS Consolidated Results of Operations The following results of operations discussion compares the year ended December 31, 2011, to the year ended December 31, 2010. All amounts in the tables (except sales and customers) are in millions of dollars. Continuing Operations Operating Revenue A detail of the components of PHIs consolidated operating revenue is as follows: 2011 2010 Change Power Delivery $ 4,650 $ 5,114 $ (464 ) Pepco Energy Services 1,238 1,883 (645 ) Other Non Regulated 48 54 (6 ) Corporate and Other (16 ) (12 ) (4 ) Total Operating Revenue $ 5,920 $ 7,039 $ (1,119 ) Power Delivery Business The following table categorizes Power Deliverys operating revenue by type of revenue. 2011 2010 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 1,891 $ 1,858 $ 33 Default Electricity Supply Revenue 2,462 2,951 (489 ) Other Electric Revenue 67 68 (1 ) Total Electric Operating Revenue 4,420 4,877 (457 ) Regulated Gas Revenue 183 191 (8 ) Other Gas Revenue 47 46 1 Total Gas Operating Revenue 230 237 (7 ) Total Power Delivery Operating Revenue $ 4,650 $ 5,114 $ (464 ) Regulated T&D Electric Revenue includes revenue from the distribution of electricity, including the distribution of Default Electricity Supply, by PHIs utility subsidiaries to customers within their service territories at regulated rates. Regulated T&D Electric Revenue also includes transmission service revenue that PHIs utility subsidiaries receive as transmission owners from PJM at rates regulated by FERC. Default Electricity Supply Revenue is the revenue received from the supply of electricity by PHIs utility subsidiaries at regulated rates to retail customers who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier. Depending on the jurisdiction, Default Electricity Supply is also known as SOS or BGS. The costs related to Default Electricity Supply are included in Fuel and Purchased Energy. Default Electricity Supply Revenue also includes revenue from Transition Bond Charges that ACE receives, and pays to ACE Funding, to fund the principal and interest payments on Transition Bonds issued by ACE Funding, and revenue in the form of transmission enhancement credits that PHI utility subsidiaries receive as transmission owners from PJM for approved regional transmission expansion plan costs. Other Electric Revenue includes work and services performed on behalf of customers, including other utilities, which is generally not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of pole attachments, late payment fees and collection fees. 51 PEPCO HOLDINGS Regulated Gas Revenue includes the revenue DPL receives from on system natural gas delivered sales and the transportation of natural gas for customers within its service territory at regulated rates. Other Gas Revenue consists of DPLs off system natural gas sales and the short term release of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity not needed to serve customers. Off system sales are made possible when low demand for natural gas by regulated customers creates excess pipeline capacity. Regulated T&D Electric 2011 2010 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue Residential $ 683 $ 683 $ Commercial and industrial 884 883 1 Transmission and other 324 292 32 Total Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 1,891 $ 1,858 $ 33 2011 2010 Change Regulated T&D Electric Sales (Gigawatt hours(GWh)) Residential 17,728 18,398 (670 ) Commercial and industrial 31,282 32,045 (763 ) Transmission and other 256 260 (4 ) Total Regulated T&D Electric Sales 49,266 50,703 (1,437 ) 2011 2010 Change Regulated T&D Electric Customers (in thousands) Residential 1,636 1,635 1 Commercial and industrial 198 198 Transmission and other 2 2 Total Regulated T&D Electric Customers 1,836 1,835 1 The Pepco, DPL and ACE service territories are located within a corridor extending from the District of Columbia to southern New Jersey. These service territories are economically diverse and include key industries that contribute to the regional economic base. Commercial activity in the region includes banking and other professional services, government, insurance, real estate, shopping malls, casinos, stand alone construction and tourism. Industrial activity in the region includes chemical, glass, pharmaceutical, steel manufacturing, food processing and oil refining. Regulated T&D Electric Revenue increased by $33 million primarily due to: An increase of $32 million due to distribution rate increases (Pepco in the District of Columbia effective March 2010 and July 2010, and in Maryland effective July 2010; DPL in Maryland effective July 2011, and in Delaware effective February 2011; and ACE in New Jersey effective June 2010). An increase of $32 million in transmission revenue primarily attributable to higher rates effective June 1, 2010 and June 1, 2011 related to increases in transmission plant investment. 52 PEPCO HOLDINGS An increase of $11 million due to higher pass through revenue (which is substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Other Taxes) primarily the result of rate increases in Montgomery County, Maryland utility taxes that are collected by Pepco on behalf of the county. An increase of $7 million primarily due to Pepco customer growth in 2011, primarily in the residential class. An increase of $2 million due to the implementation of the EmPower Maryland (a demand side management program) surcharge in March 2010 (which is substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Depreciation and Amortization). The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $30 million due to an ACE New Jersey Societal Benefit Charge rate decrease that became effective in January 2011 (which is offset in Deferred Electric Service Costs). A decrease of $11 million due to lower sales as a result of cooler weather during the spring and summer months of 2011, and warmer weather during the fall months of 2011, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2010. A decrease of $10 million due to lower non weather related average customer usage. Default Electricity Supply 2011 2010 Change Default Electricity Supply Revenue Residential $ 1,668 $ 2,022 $ (354 ) Commercial and industrial 642 733 (91 ) Other 152 196 (44 ) Total Default Electricity Supply Revenue $ 2,462 $ 2,951 $ (489 ) Other Default Electricity Supply Revenue consists primarily of (i) revenue from the resale by ACE in the PJM RTO market of energy and capacity purchased under contracts with unaffiliated NUGs, and (ii) revenue from transmission enhancement credits. 2011 2010 Change Default Electricity Supply Sales (GWh) Residential 15,545 17,385 (1,840 ) Commercial and industrial 6,168 7,034 (866 ) Other 73 93 (20 ) Total Default Electricity Supply Sales 21,786 24,512 (2,726 ) 2011 2010 Change Default Electricity Supply Customers (in thousands) Residential 1,432 1,525 (93 ) Commercial and industrial 137 148 (11 ) Other 1 (1 ) Total Default Electricity Supply Customers 1,569 1,674 (105 ) 53 PEPCO HOLDINGS Default Electricity Supply Revenue decreased by $489 million primarily due to: A decrease of $200 million due to lower sales, primarily as a result of customer migration to competitive suppliers. A net decrease of $153 million as a result of lower Pepco and DPL Default Electricity Supply rates, partially offset by higher ACE rates. A decrease of $94 million due to lower sales as a result of cooler weather during the spring and summer months of 2011, and warmer weather during the fall months of 2011, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2010. A decrease of $40 million in wholesale energy and capacity resale revenues primarily due to the sale of lower volumes of electricity and capacity purchased from NUGs. A decrease of $3 million due to a decrease in revenue from Transmission Enhancement Credits. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $3 million resulting from an approval by the DCPSC of an increase in Pepcos cost recovery rate for providing Default Electricity Supply in the District of Columbia to provide for recovery of higher cash working capital costs incurred in prior periods. The higher cash working capital costs were incurred when the billing cycle for providers of Default Electricity Supply was shortened from a monthly to a weekly period, effective in June 2009. Total Default Electricity Supply Revenue for the 2011 period includes a decrease of $8 million in unbilled revenue attributable to ACEs BGS ($5 million decrease in net income), primarily due to lower customer usage and lower Default Electricity Supply rates during the unbilled revenue period at the end of 2011 as compared to the corresponding period in 2010. Under the BGS terms approved by the NJBPU, ACEs BGS unbilled revenue is not included in the deferral calculation until it is billed to customers, and therefore has an impact on the results of operations in the period during which it is accrued. Regulated Gas 2011 2010 Change Regulated Gas Revenue Residential $ 113 $ 118 $ (5 ) Commercial and industrial 61 65 (4 ) Transportation and other 9 8 1 Total Regulated Gas Revenue $ 183 $ 191 $ (8 ) 2011 2010 Change Regulated Gas Sales (billion cubic feet) Residential 7 8 (1 ) Commercial and industrial 5 5 Transportation and other 7 6 1 Total Regulated Gas Sales 19 19 54 PEPCO HOLDINGS 2011 2010 Change Regulated Gas Customers (in thousands) Residential 115 114 1 Commercial and industrial 9 9 Transportation and other Total Regulated Gas Customers 124 123 1 DPLs natural gas service territory is located in New Castle County, Delaware. Several key industries contribute to the economic base as well as to growth. Commercial activity in the region includes banking and other professional services, government, insurance, real estate, shopping malls, stand alone construction and tourism. Industrial activity in the region includes chemical and pharmaceutical. Regulated Gas Revenue decreased by $8 million primarily due to: A decrease of $17 million due to lower non weather related average customer usage. The decrease was partially offset by: An increase of $6 million due to higher sales primarily as a result of colder weather during the winter of 2011 as compared to the winter of 2010. An increase of $2 million due to a distribution rate increase effective February 2011. An increase of $2 million due to customer growth in 2011. Pepco Energy Services Pepco Energy Services operating revenue decreased $645 million primarily due to: A decrease of $672 million due to lower retail supply sales volume primarily attributable to the ongoing wind down of the retail energy supply business. A decrease of $33 million due to lower generation and capacity revenues at the generating facilities. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $61 million due to increased energy services activities. 55 PEPCO HOLDINGS Operating Expenses Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales A detail of PHIs consolidated Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales is as follows: 2011 2010 Change Power Delivery $ 2,490 $ 3,086 $ (596 ) Pepco Energy Services 1,106 1,691 (585 ) Corporate and Other (2 ) (6 ) 4 Total $ 3,594 $ 4,771 $ (1,177 ) Power Delivery Business Power Deliverys Fuel and Purchased Energy consists of the cost of electricity and natural gas purchased by its utility subsidiaries to fulfill their respective Default Electricity Supply and Regulated Gas obligations and, as such, is recoverable from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders. It also includes the cost of natural gas purchased for off system sales. Fuel and Purchased Energy expense decreased by $596 million primarily due to: A decrease of $300 million due to lower average electricity costs under Default Electricity Supply contracts. A decrease of $221 million primarily due to customer migration to competitive suppliers. A decrease of $83 million due to lower electricity sales primarily as a result of cooler weather during the spring and summer months of 2011, and warmer weather during the fall months of 2011, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2010. A decrease of $16 million in the cost of gas purchases for on system sales as a result of lower average gas prices, lower volumes purchased and lower withdrawals from storage. A decrease of $11 million from the settlement of financial hedges entered into as part of DPLs hedge program for the purchase of regulated natural gas. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $18 million in deferred electricity expense primarily due to lower Default Electricity Supply rates, which resulted in a higher rate of recovery of Default Electricity Supply costs. An increase of $18 million in deferred natural gas expense as a result of a higher rate of recovery of natural gas supply costs. Pepco Energy Services Pepco Energy Services Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales decreased $585 million primarily due to: A decrease of $621 million due to lower volumes of electricity and gas purchased to serve decreased retail supply sales volume as a result of the ongoing wind down of the retail energy supply business. A decrease of $10 million due to lower fuel usage associated with the generating facilities. 56 PEPCO HOLDINGS The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $46 million due to increased energy services activities. Other Operation and Maintenance A detail of PHIs Other Operation and Maintenance expense is as follows: 2011 2010 Change Power Delivery $ 884 $ 809 $ 75 Pepco Energy Services 81 95 (14 ) Other Non Regulated 6 4 2 Corporate and Other (57 ) (24 ) (33 ) Total $ 914 $ 884 $ 30 Other Operation and Maintenance expense for Power Delivery increased by $75 million primarily due to: An increase of $38 million associated with higher tree trimming and preventative maintenance costs. An increase of $13 million primarily due to higher 2011 DCPSC rate case costs and reliability audit expenses and due to 2010 Pepco adjustments for the deferral of (i) February 2010 severe winter storm costs of $5 million and (ii) distribution rate case costs of $4 million that previously were charged to other operation and maintenance expense. The adjustments were recorded in accordance with a MPSC rate order issued in August 2010 and a DCPSC rate order issued in February 2010, allowing for the recovery of the costs. An increase of $9 million in employee related costs, primarily benefit expenses. An increase of $8 million primarily due to Pepcos emergency restoration improvement project and reliability improvement costs. An increase of $8 million in customer support service and system support costs. An increase of $6 million in communication costs. An increase of $5 million in corporate cost allocations, primarily due to higher contractor and outside legal counsel fees. An increase of $5 million related to New Jersey Societal Benefit Program costs that are deferred and recoverable. An increase of $4 million in emergency restoration costs. The increase is primarily related to significant incremental costs incurred for repair work following Hurricane Irene in August 2011. Costs incurred for repair work were $28 million, of which $22 million was deferred as regulatory assets to reflect the probable recovery of these storm costs in certain jurisdictions, and the remaining $6 million was charged to other operation and maintenance expense. Approximately $4 million of these total incremental storm costs have been estimated for the cost of restoration services provided by outside contractors. Since the invoices for such services had not been received at December 31, 2011, actual invoices may vary from these estimates. PHIs utility subsidiaries currently plan to seek recovery of the incremental Hurricane Irene costs in each of their various jurisdictions in pending or planned distribution rate case filings. 57 PEPCO HOLDINGS An increase of $3 million in costs related to customer requested and mutual assistance work (primarily offset in other Electric T&D Revenue). The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $17 million resulting from adjustments recorded by PHI in 2011 associated with the accounting for DPL and Pepco Default Electricity Supply. These adjustments were primarily due to the under recognition of allowed returns on working capital, uncollectible accounts, late fees and administrative costs. A decrease of $15 million in environmental remediation costs. Restructuring Charge As a result of PHIs organizational review in the second quarter of 2010, PHIs operating expenses include a pre tax restructuring charge of $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, related to severance and health and welfare benefits to be provided to terminated employees. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and Amortization expense increased by $33 million to $426 million in 2011 from $393 million in 2010 primarily due to: An increase of $16 million in amortization of stranded costs as the result of higher revenue due to rate increases effective October 2010 for the ACE Transition Bond Charge and Market Transition Charge Tax (partially offset in Default Electricity Supply Revenue). An increase of $14 million due to utility plant additions. An increase of $4 million in amortization of regulatory assets primarily associated with the EmPower Maryland surcharge that became effective in March 2010 (which is substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue). An increase of $1 million in amortization of software upgrades to Pepcos Energy Management System. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $3 million primarily due to the higher 2010 recognition of asset retirement obligations associated with Pepco Energy Services generating facilities scheduled for deactivation in May 2012. Other Taxes Other Taxes increased by $17 million to $451 million in 2011 from $434 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to: An increase of $16 million primarily due to rate increases in the Montgomery County, Maryland utility taxes that are collected and passed through by Pepco (substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue). 58 PEPCO HOLDINGS An increase of $5 million due to an adjustment in the third quarter of 2010 to correct certain errors related to other taxes. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $5 million in the Energy Assistance Trust Fund surcharge primarily due to rate decreases effective October 2010 (substantially offset by a corresponding decrease in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue). Gain on Early Termination of Finance Leases Held in Trust PHIs operating expenses include a $39 million pre tax gain for the year ended December 31, 2011 associated with the early termination of several lease investments included in its cross border energy lease portfolio. For a further discussion of this transaction, see Note (8), Leasing Activities, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI. Deferred Electric Service Costs Deferred Electric Service Costs, which relate only to ACE, represent (i) the over or under recovery of electricity costs incurred by ACE to fulfill its Default Electricity Supply obligation and (ii) the over or under recovery of New Jersey Societal Benefit Program costs incurred by ACE. The cost of electricity purchased is reported under Fuel and Purchased Energy and the corresponding revenue is reported under Default Electricity Supply Revenue. The cost of New Jersey Societal Benefit Programs is reported under Other Operation and Maintenance and the corresponding revenue is reported under Regulated T&D Electric Revenue. Deferred Electric Service Costs increased by $45 million, to an expense reduction of $63 million in 2011 as compared to an expense reduction of $108 million in 2010, primarily due to higher Default Electricity Supply Revenue rates and lower electricity supply costs. Effects of Pepco Divestiture Related Claims The DCPSC on May 18, 2010 issued an order addressing all of the outstanding issues relating to Pepcos obligation to share with its District of Columbia customers the net proceeds realized by Pepco from the sale of its generation related assets in 2000. This order disallowed certain items that Pepco had included in the costs it deducted in calculating the net proceeds of the sale. The disallowance of these costs, together with interest, increased the aggregate amount Pepco is required to distribute to customers by approximately $11 million. PHI recognized a pre tax expense of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Other Income (Expenses) Other Expenses (which are net of Other Income) decreased by $246 million primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt that was recorded in 2010 and lower interest expense in 2011 resulting from the reduction in outstanding long term debt in 2010 with the proceeds from the Conectiv Energy sale. 59 PEPCO HOLDINGS Loss on Extinguishment of Debt In 2010, PHI purchased or redeemed senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1,194 million. In connection with these transactions, PHI recorded a pre tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $189 million in 2010, $174 million of which was attributable to the retirement of the debt and $15 million of which related to the acceleration of losses on treasury rate lock transactions associated with the retired debt. For a further discussion of these transactions, see Note (11), Debt, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI. Income Tax Expense PHIs consolidated effective tax rates from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were 36.4% and 7.3%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the recognition of certain tax benefits in 2010 that did not recur in 2011 and PHIs early termination of its interest in certain cross border energy leases in 2011. In 2010, certain PHI subsidiaries were restructured which subjected PHI to state income taxes in new jurisdictions and resulted in current state tax benefits that were recorded in 2010 and did not recur in 2011. Specifically, on April 1, 2010, as part of an ongoing effort to simplify PHIs organizational structure, certain of PHIs subsidiaries were converted from corporations to single member limited liability companies. In addition to increased organizational flexibility and reduced administrative costs, converting these entities to limited liability companies allows PHI to include income or losses in the former corporations in a single state income tax return, thus increasing the utilization of state income tax attributes. As a result of inclusions of income or losses in a single state return as discussed above, PHI recorded an $8 million benefit by reversing a valuation allowance on certain state net operating losses and an additional benefit of $6 million resulting from changes to certain state deferred tax benefits. In addition, in November 2010, PHI reached final settlement with the IRS with respect to its federal tax returns for the years 1996 to 2002 for all issues except its cross border energy lease investments. In connection with the settlement, PHI reallocated certain amounts on deposit with the IRS since 2006 among liabilities in the settlement years and subsequent years. In light of the settlement and reallocations, PHI has recalculated the estimated interest due for the tax years 1996 to 2002. The revised estimate resulted in the reversal of $15 million (after tax) of estimated interest due to the IRS which was recorded as an income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2010. In 2011, a $17 million (after tax) income tax benefit was recorded in the first quarter when PHI reached a settlement with the IRS related to the calculation of interest due as a result of the November 2010 audit settlement. This benefit was more than offset during the second quarter of 2011, when PHI terminated early its interest in certain cross border energy leases prior to the end of their stated term. As a result of the early terminations, PHI reversed $22 million of previously recognized federal tax benefits associated with those leases that will not be realized. Discontinued Operations For the year ended December 31, 2011, the $3 million loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, consists of an after tax loss from operations of $1 million and after tax net loss of $2 million from dispositions of assets and businesses. 60 PEPCO HOLDINGS The following results of operations discussion is for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. All amounts in the tables (except sales and customers) are in millions of dollars. Continuing Operations Operating Revenue A detail of the components of PHIs consolidated operating revenue is as follows: 2010 2009 Change Power Delivery $ 5,114 $ 4,980 $ 134 Pepco Energy Services 1,883 2,383 (500 ) Other Non Regulated 54 51 3 Corporate and Other (12 ) (12 ) Total Operating Revenue $ 7,039 $ 7,402 $ (363 ) Power Delivery Business The following table categorizes Power Deliverys operating revenue by type of revenue. 2010 2009 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 1,858 $ 1,653 $ 205 Default Electricity Supply Revenue 2,951 2,990 (39 ) Other Electric Revenue 68 69 (1 ) Total Electric Operating Revenue 4,877 4,712 165 Regulated Gas Revenue 191 228 (37 ) Other Gas Revenue 46 40 6 Total Gas Operating Revenue 237 268 (31 ) Total Power Delivery Operating Revenue $ 5,114 $ 4,980 $ 134 Regulated T&D Electric Revenue includes revenue from the distribution of electricity, including the distribution of Default Electricity Supply, by PHIs utility subsidiaries to customers within their service territories at regulated rates. Regulated T&D Electric Revenue also includes transmission service revenue that PHIs utility subsidiaries receive as transmission owners from PJM at rates regulated by FERC. Default Electricity Supply Revenue is the revenue received from the supply of electricity by PHIs utility subsidiaries at regulated rates to retail customers who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier. Depending on the jurisdiction, Default Electricity Supply is also known as SOS or BGS. The costs related to Default Electricity Supply are included in Fuel and Purchased Energy. Default Electricity Supply Revenue also includes revenue from Transition Bond Charges that ACE receives, and pays to ACE Funding, to fund the principal and interest payments on Transition Bonds issued by ACE Funding, and revenue in the form of transmission enhancement credits that PHI utility subsidiaries receive as transmission owners from PJM for approved regional transmission expansion plan costs. Other Electric Revenue includes work and services performed on behalf of customers, including other utilities, which is generally not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of pole attachments, late payment fees and collection fees. Regulated Gas Revenue includes the revenue DPL receives from on system natural gas delivered sales and the transportation of natural gas for customers within its service territory at regulated rates. 61 PEPCO HOLDINGS Other Gas Revenue consists of DPLs off system natural gas sales and the short term release of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity not needed to serve customers. Off system sales are made possible when low demand for natural gas by regulated customers creates excess pipeline capacity. Regulated T&D Electric 2010 2009 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue Residential $ 683 $ 596 $ 87 Commercial and industrial 883 804 79 Transmission and other 292 253 39 Total Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 1,858 $ 1,653 $ 205 2010 2009 Change Regulated T&D Electric Sales (GWh) Residential 18,398 16,871 1,527 Commercial and industrial 32,045 31,570 475 Transmission and other 260 261 (1 ) Total Regulated T&D Electric Sales 50,703 48,702 2,001 2010 2009 Change Regulated T&D Electric Customers (in thousands) Residential 1,635 1,623 12 Commercial and industrial 198 198 Transmission and other 2 2 Total Regulated T&D Electric Customers 1,835 1,823 12 The Pepco, DPL and ACE service territories are located within a corridor extending from the District of Columbia to southern New Jersey. These service territories are economically diverse and include key industries that contribute to the regional economic base. Commercial activity in the region includes banking and other professional services, government, insurance, real estate, shopping malls, casinos, stand alone construction and tourism. Industrial activity in the region includes chemical, glass, pharmaceutical, steel manufacturing, food processing and oil refining. Regulated T&D Electric Revenue increased by $205 million primarily due to: An increase of $61 million due to higher pass through revenue (which is substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Other Taxes) primarily the result of rate increases in Montgomery County, Maryland utility taxes that are collected by Pepco on behalf of the county. An increase of $46 million due to distribution rate increases (Pepco in the District of Columbia effective November 2009 and March 2010; DPL in Maryland effective December 2009; DPL in Delaware effective April 2010; and ACE in New Jersey effective June 2010). 62 PEPCO HOLDINGS An increase of $37 million in transmission revenue primarily attributable to higher rates effective June 1, 2010 related to an increase in transmission plant investment. An increase of $26 million due to higher revenue in the District of Columbia, Delaware and New Jersey service territories, primarily as a result of warmer weather during the spring and summer months of 2010 as compared to 2009. Distribution revenue in Maryland was decoupled from consumption in 2010 and 2009, and therefore, the weather in this jurisdiction does not affect the period to period comparison. The BSA was not implemented in the District of Columbia until November 2009, and therefore, the period to period comparison is affected by weather. An increase of $15 million due to the implementation of the EmPower Maryland surcharge in March 2010 (which is substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Depreciation and Amortization). An increase of $9 million due to higher non weather related average customer usage. An increase of $8 million due to Pepco customer growth of 1% in 2010, primarily in the residential class. Default Electricity Supply 2010 2009 Change Default Electricity Supply Revenue Residential $ 2,022 $ 1,915 $ 107 Commercial and industrial 733 915 (182 ) Other 196 160 36 Total Default Electricity Supply Revenue $ 2,951 $ 2,990 $ (39 ) Other Default Electricity Supply Revenue consists primarily of (i) revenue from the resale by ACE in the PJM RTO market of energy and capacity purchased under contracts with unaffiliated NUGs, and (ii) revenue from Transmission Enhancement Credits. 2010 2009 Change Default Electricity Supply Sales (GWh) Residential 17,385 16,274 1,111 Commercial and industrial 7,034 8,470 (1,436 ) Other 93 101 (8 ) Total Default Electricity Supply Sales 24,512 24,845 (333 ) 2010 2009 Change Default Electricity Supply Customers (in thousands) Residential 1,525 1,572 (47 ) Commercial and industrial 148 159 (11 ) Other 1 2 (1 ) Total Default Electricity Supply Customers 1,674 1,733 (59 ) Default Electricity Supply Revenue decreased by $39 million primarily due to: A decrease of $200 million due to lower sales, primarily as a result of commercial customer migration to competitive suppliers. 63 PEPCO HOLDINGS A decrease of $59 million as a result of lower Default Electricity Supply rates. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $144 million due to higher sales primarily as a result of warmer weather during the spring and summer months of 2010 as compared to 2009. An increase of $40 million due to higher non weather related average customer usage. An increase of $29 million in wholesale energy and capacity revenues primarily due to higher market prices for the sale of electricity and capacity purchased from NUGs. An increase of $8 million due to an increase in revenue from transmission enhancement credits. Total Default Electricity Supply Revenue for the 2010 period includes an increase of $8 million in unbilled revenue attributable to ACEs BGS ($5 million increase in net income), primarily due to lower customer usage and lower Default Electricity Supply rates during the unbilled revenue period at the end of 2010 as compared to the corresponding period in 2009. Under the BGS terms approved by the NJBPU, ACEs BGS unbilled revenue is not included in the deferral calculation until it is billed to customers, and therefore has an impact on the results of operations in the period during which it is accrued.

Several key industries contribute to the economic base as well as to growth. Commercial activity in the region includes banking and other professional services, government, insurance, real estate, shopping malls, stand alone construction and tourism. 64 PEPCO HOLDINGS Industrial activity in the region includes chemical and pharmaceutical. Regulated Gas Revenue decreased by $37 million primarily due to: A decrease of $22 million due to Gas Cost Rate (GCR) decreases effective March 2009 and November 2009. A decrease of $14 million due to lower sales as a result of milder weather during the winter months of 2010 as compared to 2009. Other Gas Revenue Other Gas Revenue increased by $6 million primarily due to higher revenue from off system sales resulting from: An increase of $4 million due to higher demand from electric generators and natural gas marketers. An increase of $2 million due to higher market prices. Pepco Energy Services Pepco Energy Services operating revenue decreased $500 million primarily due to: A decrease of $651 million due to lower retail electricity sales volume due to the ongoing wind down of the retail energy supply business. The decrease is partially offset by: An increase of $100 million due to higher electricity generation output as the result of completed transmission construction projects and warmer than normal weather, and lower RPM charges associated with the generating facilities. An increase of $38 million due to increased energy services activities. An increase of $13 million due to a higher retail natural gas supply load as the result of 2009 customer acquisitions, partially offset by lower retail natural gas prices. Operating Expenses Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales A detail of PHIs consolidated Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales is as follows: 2010 2009 Change Power Delivery $ 3,086 $ 3,243 $ (157 ) Pepco Energy Services 1,691 2,179 (488 ) Corporate and Other (6 ) (7 ) 1 Total $ 4,771 $ 5,415 $ (644 ) 65 PEPCO HOLDINGS Power Delivery Business Power Deliverys Fuel and Purchased Energy consists of the cost of electricity and natural gas purchased by its utility subsidiaries to fulfill their respective Default Electricity Supply and Regulated Gas obligations and, as such, is recoverable from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders. It also includes the cost of natural gas purchased for off system sales. Fuel and Purchased Energy expense decreased by $157 million primarily due to: A decrease of $197 million primarily due to commercial customer migration to competitive suppliers. A decrease of $59 million in deferred electricity expense primarily due to lower Default Electricity Supply Revenue rates, which resulted in a lower rate of recovery of Default Electricity Supply costs. A decrease of $17 million in deferred natural gas expense as a result of a lower rate of recovery of natural gas supply costs. A decrease of $14 million due to lower average electricity costs under Default Electricity Supply contracts. A decrease of $12 million from the settlement of financial hedges entered into as part of DPLs hedge program for the purchase of regulated natural gas. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $143 million due to higher electricity sales primarily as a result of warmer weather during the spring and summer months of 2010 as compared to 2009. Pepco Energy Services Pepco Energy Services Fuel and Purchased Energy and Other Services Cost of Sales decreased $488 million primarily due to: A decrease of $571 million due to lower volumes of electricity purchased to serve decreased retail customer load as a result of the ongoing wind down of the retail energy supply business. The decrease is partially offset by: An increase of $42 million due to increased energy services activities. An increase of $27 million due to higher fuel usage associated with the generating facilities. An increase of $15 million due to a higher retail natural gas supply load as the result of 2009 customer acquisitions, partially offset by lower wholesale natural gas prices. Other Operation and Maintenance A detail of PHIs Other Operation and Maintenance expense is as follows: 2010 2009 Change Power Delivery $ 809 $ 752 $ 57 Pepco Energy Services 95 90 5 Other Non Regulated 4 2 2 Corporate and Other (24 ) (25 ) 1 Total $ 884 $ 819 $ 65 66 PEPCO HOLDINGS Other Operation and Maintenance expense for Power Delivery increased by $57 million; however, excluding an increase of $11 million primarily related to bad debt and administrative expenses that are deferred and recoverable in Default Electricity Supply Revenue, Other Operation and Maintenance expense increased by $46 million. The $46 million increase was primarily due to: An increase of $33 million in emergency restoration costs primarily due to severe storms in February, July and August 2010. An increase of $17 million in estimated environmental remediation costs. An increase of $14 million primarily due to higher tree trimming and preventative maintenance costs. An increase of $5 million primarily due to system support and customer support service costs. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $17 million in employee related costs, primarily due to lower pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) expenses. A decrease of $9 million primarily due to Pepco deferral of (i) February 2010 severe winter storm costs, and (ii) distribution rate case costs, which in each case originally had been charged to Other Operation and Maintenance expense. These deferrals were recorded in accordance with a MPSC rate order issued in August 2010 and a DCPSC rate order issued in February 2010, respectively, authorizing the establishment of regulatory assets for the recovery of these costs. Other Operation and Maintenance expense for Pepco Energy Services increased $5 million, primarily due to increases of $8 million in power plant operating costs and $3 million due to the repair cost of a distribution system pipe leak; partially offset by a decrease of $5 million in bad debt expense. Restructuring Charge As a result of PHIs organizational review in the second quarter of 2010, PHIs operating expenses include a pre tax restructuring charge of $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, related to severance and health and welfare benefits to be provided to terminated employees. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and Amortization expense increased by $44 million to $393 million in 2010 from $349 million in 2009 primarily due to: An increase of $12 million in amortization of regulatory assets primarily due to the EmPower Maryland surcharge that became effective in March 2010 (which is substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue). An increase of $10 million due to utility plant additions. 67 PEPCO HOLDINGS An increase of $8 million due to higher amortization by ACE of stranded costs, primarily the result of higher revenue due to increases in sales (partially offset in Default Electricity Supply Revenue). An increase of $4 million primarily due to the recognition of asset retirement obligations associated with Pepco Energy Services generating facilities scheduled for deactivation in May 2012. An increase of $2 million in the amortization of demand side management program deferred expenses. Other Taxes Other Taxes increased by $66 million to $434 million in 2010 from $368 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to increased pass throughs experienced by Power Delivery (which are substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue) primarily resulting from utility tax rate increases imposed by Montgomery County, Maryland. Deferred Electric Service Costs Deferred Electric Service Costs, which relate only to ACE, represent (i) the over or under recovery of electricity costs incurred by ACE to fulfill its Default Electricity Supply obligation and (ii) the over or under recovery of New Jersey Societal Benefit Program costs incurred by ACE. The cost of electricity purchased is reported under Fuel and Purchased Energy and the corresponding revenue is reported under Default Electricity Supply Revenue. The cost of New Jersey Societal Benefit Programs is reported under Other Operation and Maintenance and the corresponding revenue is reported under Regulated T&D Electric Revenue. Deferred Electric Service Costs increased by $53 million, to an expense reduction of $108 million in 2010 as compared to an expense reduction of $161 million in 2009, primarily due to an increase in deferred electricity expense as a result of lower electricity supply costs and higher Default Electricity Supply Revenue rates. Effects of Pepco Divestiture Related Claims District of Columbia Divestiture Case The DCPSC on May 18, 2010 issued an order addressing all of the outstanding issues relating to Pepcos obligation to share with its District of Columbia customers the net proceeds realized by Pepco from the sale of its generation related assets in 2000. This order disallowed certain items that Pepco had included in the costs it deducted in calculating the net proceeds of the sale. The disallowance of these costs, together with interest, increased the aggregate amount Pepco was required to distribute to customers by approximately $11 million. PHI recognized a pre tax expense of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Settlement of Mirant Bankruptcy Claims In March 2009, the DCPSC approved an allocation between Pepco and its District of Columbia customers of the District of Columbia portion of the Mirant bankruptcy settlement proceeds remaining after the transfer of the power purchase agreement between Pepco and Panda Brandywine, L.P. As a result, Pepco recorded a pre tax gain of $14 million in the first quarter of 2009 reflecting the District of Columbia proceeds retained by Pepco. In July 2009, the MPSC approved an allocation between Pepco and its Maryland customers of the Maryland portion of the Mirant bankruptcy settlement proceeds. As a result, Pepco recorded a pre tax gain of $26 million in the third quarter of 2009 reflecting the Maryland proceeds retained by Pepco. 68 PEPCO HOLDINGS Other Income (Expenses) Other Expenses (which are net of Other Income) increased by $153 million primarily due to a $189 million loss on extinguishment of debt that was recorded in 2010 as further discussed below, partially offset by lower interest expense of $34 million. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt In 2010, PHI purchased or redeemed senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1,194 million. In connection with these transactions, PHI recorded a pre tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $189 million in 2010, $174 million of which was attributable to the retirement of the debt and $15 million of which related to the acceleration of losses on treasury rate lock transactions associated with debt that was retired. For a further discussion of these transactions, see Note (11), Debt, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI. Income Tax Expense PHIs consolidated effective tax rates from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were 7.3% and 31.8%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily due to two factors. The first is the recording of current state tax benefits resulting from the restructuring of certain PHI subsidiaries which subjected PHI to state income taxes in new jurisdictions. On April 1, 2010, as part of an ongoing effort to simplify PHIs organizational structure, certain of PHIs subsidiaries were converted from corporations to single member limited liability companies. In addition to increased organizational flexibility and reduced administrative costs, converting these entities to limited liability companies allows PHI to include income or losses in the former corporations in a single state income tax return, thus increasing the utilization of state income tax attributes. As a result of inclusions of income or losses in a single state return as discussed above, PHI recorded an $8 million benefit by reversing a valuation allowance on certain state net operating losses and an additional benefit of $6 million resulting from changes to certain state deferred tax benefits. The second factor is the reversal of accrued interest on uncertain and effectively settled tax positions resulting from final settlement with the IRS of certain open tax years. In November 2010, PHI reached final settlement with the IRS with respect to its federal tax returns for the years 1996 to 2002 for all issues except its cross border energy lease investments. In connection with the settlement, PHI reallocated certain amounts on deposit with the IRS since 2006 among liabilities in the settlement years and subsequent years. In light of the settlement and reallocations, PHI has recalculated the estimated interest due for the tax years 1996 to 2002. The revised estimate has resulted in the reversal of $15 million of previously accrued estimated interest due to the IRS. This reversal has been recorded as an income tax benefit in 2010, and PHI recorded an additional tax benefit of $17 million (after tax) in the second quarter of 2011 when the IRS finalized its calculation of the amount of interest due. Discontinued Operations For the year ended December 31, 2010, the $107 million loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, consists of after tax income from operations of $6 million and after tax net losses of $113 million from dispositions of assets and businesses. Capital Resources and Liquidity This section discusses PHIs working capital, cash flow activity, capital requirements and other uses and sources of capital. 69 PEPCO HOLDINGS Working Capital At December 31, 2011, PHIs current assets on a consolidated basis totaled $1.4 billion and its current liabilities totaled $1.9 billion, resulting in a working capital deficit of $422 million. PHI expects the working capital deficit at December 31, 2011 to be funded during 2012 in part through cash flow from operations. Additional working capital will be provided by anticipated reductions in collateral requirements due to the ongoing wind down of the Pepco Energy Services retail energy supply business. At December 31, 2010, PHIs current assets on a consolidated basis totaled $1.8 billion and its current liabilities totaled $1.8 billion. The decrease in working capital from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011 was primarily due to a decrease in prepayments of income taxes and an increase in short term debt. Prepayments of income taxes have decreased in 2011 because certain net operating losses that were classified as current assets in 2010 were reclassified as long term assets in 2011. Short term debt increased to temporarily support higher spending by the utilities on infrastructure investments and reliability initiatives until permanent financing is obtained. At December 31, 2011, PHIs cash and current cash equivalents totaled $109 million, of which $87 million was invested in money market funds, and the balance was held as cash and uncollected funds. Current restricted cash equivalents (cash that is available to be used only for designated purposes) totaled $11 million. At December 31, 2010, PHIs cash and current cash equivalents totaled $21 million, of which $1 million was reflected on the balance sheet in Conectiv Energy assets held for sale, and its current restricted cash equivalents totaled $11 million. A detail of PHIs short term debt balance and its current maturities of long term debt and project funding balance follows: As of December 31, 2011 (millions of dollars) Type PHIParent Pepco DPL ACE ACEFunding PepcoEnergyServices PHIConsolidated Variable Rate Demand Bonds $ $ $ 105 $ 23 $ $ 18 $ 146 Commercial Paper 465 74 47 586 Total Short Term Debt $ 465 $ 74 $ 152 $ 23 $ $ 18 $ 732 Current Maturities of Long Term Debt and Project Funding $ $ $ 66 $ $ 37 $ 9 $ 112 As of December 31, 2010 (millions of dollars) Type PHIParent Pepco DPL ACE ACEFunding PepcoEnergyServices PHIConsolidated Variable Rate Demand Bonds $ $ $ 105 $ 23 $ $ 18 $ 146 Commercial Paper 230 158 388 Total Short Term Debt $ 230 $ $ 105 $ 181 $ $ 18 $ 534 Current Maturities of Long Term Debt and Project Funding $ $ $ 35 $ $ 35 $ 5 $ 75 Credit Facility PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE maintain an unsecured syndicated credit facility to provide for their respective liquidity needs, including obtaining letters of credit, borrowing for general corporate purposes and supporting their commercial paper programs. On August 1, 2011, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with respect to the facility, which among other changes, extended the expiration date of the facility to August 1, 2016. 70 PEPCO HOLDINGS The aggregate borrowing limit under the facility is $1.5 billion, all or any portion of which may be used to obtain loans and up to $500 million of which may be used to obtain letters of credit. The facility also includes a swingline loan sub facility, pursuant to which each company may make same day borrowings in an aggregate amount not to exceed 10% of the total amount of the facility. Any swingline loan must be repaid by the borrower within fourteen days of receipt. The initial credit sublimit for PHI is $750 million and $250 million for each of Pepco, DPL and ACE. The sublimits may be increased or decreased by the individual borrower during the term of the facility, except that (i) the sum of all of the borrower sublimits following any such increase or decrease must equal the total amount of the facility and (ii) the aggregate amount of credit used at any given time by (a) PHI may not exceed $1.25 billion and (b) each of Pepco, DPL or ACE may not exceed the lesser of $500 million and the maximum amount of short term debt the company is permitted to have outstanding by its regulatory authorities. The total number of the sublimit reallocations may not exceed eight per year during the term of the facility. The interest rate payable by each company on utilized funds is, at the borrowing companys election, (i) the greater of the prevailing prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% and one month LIBOR plus 1.0%, or (ii) the prevailing Eurodollar rate, plus a margin that varies according to the credit rating of the borrower. In order for a borrower to use the facility, certain representations and warranties must be true and correct, and the borrower must be in compliance with specified financial covenants, including (i) the requirement that each borrowing company maintain a ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization of 65% or less, computed in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement, which calculation excludes from the definition of total indebtedness certain trust preferred securities and deferrable interest subordinated debt (not to exceed 15% of total capitalization), (ii) with certain exceptions, a restriction on sales or other dispositions of assets, and (iii) a restriction on the incurrence of liens on the assets of a borrower or any of its significant subsidiaries other than permitted liens. The credit agreement contains certain covenants and other customary agreements and requirements that, if not complied with, could result in an event of default and the acceleration of repayment obligations of one or more of the borrowers thereunder. Each of the borrowers was in compliance with all financial covenants under this facility as of December 31, 2011. The absence of a material adverse change in PHIs business, property, results of operations or financial condition is not a condition to the availability of credit under the credit agreement. The credit agreement does not include any rating triggers. PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE maintain commercial paper programs to address short term liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2011, the maximum capacity available under these programs was $875 million, $500 million, $500 million and $250 million, respectively. In January 2012, the Board of Directors approved an increase in PHIs maximum to $1.25 billion. PHI, Pepco and DPL had $465 million, $74 million and $47 million, respectively, of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011. ACE had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011. The weighted average interest rate for commercial paper issued by PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE during 2011 was 0.64%, 0.35%, 0.34% and 0.33%, respectively. The weighted average maturity of all commercial paper issued by PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE in 2011 was eleven, two, two and six days, respectively. 71 PEPCO HOLDINGS Cash and Credit Facility Available as of December 31, 2011 ConsolidatedPHI PHI Parent UtilitySubsidiaries (millions of dollars) Credit Facility (Total Capacity) $ 1,500 $ 750 $ 750 Less: Letters of Credit issued 7 2 5 Commercial Paper outstanding 586 465 121 Remaining Credit Facility Available 907 283 624 Cash Invested in Money Market Funds (a) 87 87 Total Cash and Credit Facility Available $ 994 $ 283 $ 711 (a) Cash and cash equivalents reported on the balance sheet of $109 million includes $22 million of cash and uncollected funds. Collateral Requirements of Pepco Energy Services In conducting its retail energy supply business, Pepco Energy Services, during periods of declining energy prices, has been exposed to the asymmetrical risk of having to post collateral under its wholesale purchase contracts without receiving a corresponding amount of collateral from its retail customers. To partially address these asymmetrical collateral obligations, Pepco Energy Services, in the first quarter of 2009, entered into a credit intermediation arrangement with Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. (MSCG). Under this arrangement, MSCG, in consideration for the payment to MSCG of certain fees, (i) assumed by novation, the electricity purchase obligations of Pepco Energy Services in years 2009 through 2011 under several wholesale purchase contracts, and (ii) supplied electricity to Pepco Energy Services on the same terms as the novated transactions, but without imposing on Pepco Energy Services any obligation to post collateral based on changes in electricity prices. The upfront fees incurred by Pepco Energy Services in 2009 in the amount of $25 million was amortized into expense in declining amounts over the life of the arrangement based on the fair value of the underlying contracts at the time of the novation. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, approximately $1 million $8 million and $16 million, respectively, of the fees have been amortized and reflected in interest expense. In relation to the wind down of its retail energy supply business, Pepco Energy Services in the ordinary course of business has entered into various contracts to buy and sell electricity, fuels and related products, including derivative instruments, designed to reduce its financial exposure to changes in the value of its assets and obligations due to energy price fluctuations. These contracts also typically have collateral requirements. Depending on the contract terms, the collateral required to be posted by Pepco Energy Services can be of varying forms, including cash and letters of credit. As of December 31, 2011, Pepco Energy Services posted net cash collateral of $112 million and letters of credit of $1 million. At December 31, 2010, Pepco Energy Services posted net cash collateral of $117 million and letters of credit of $113 million. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the amount of cash, plus borrowing capacity under the primary credit facility available to meet the future liquidity needs of Pepco Energy Services totaled $283 million and $728 million, respectively. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Based on the results of the 2011 actuarial valuation, PHIs net periodic pension and OPEB costs were approximately $94 million in 2011 versus $116 million in 2010. The current estimate of benefit cost for 2012 is $103 million. The utility subsidiaries are responsible for substantially all of the total PHI net periodic pension and OPEB costs. Approximately 30% of net periodic pension and OPEB costs are capitalized. PHI estimates that its net periodic pension and OPEB expense will be approximately $72 million in 2012, as compared to $66 million in 2011 and $81 million in 2010. 72 PEPCO HOLDINGS Pension benefits are provided under the PHI Retirement Plan, a non contributory, defined benefit pension plan that covers substantially all employees of Pepco, DPL and ACE and certain employees of other PHI subsidiaries. PHIs funding policy with regard to the PHI Retirement Plan is to maintain a funding level that is at least equal to the target liability as defined under the Pension Protection Act of 2006. During 2011, Pepco, DPL and ACE made discretionary tax deductible contributions totaling $110 million to the PHI Retirement Plan, in the amounts of $40 million, $40 million and $30 million, respectively. In 2010, PHI Service Company made discretionary tax deductible contributions totaling $100 million to the PHI Retirement Plan. Under the Pension Protection Act, if a plan incurs a funding shortfall in the preceding plan year, there can be required minimum quarterly contributions in the current and following plan years. PHI satisfied the minimum required contribution rules under the Pension Protection Act in 2011, 2010 and 2009. On January 31, 2012, Pepco, DPL and ACE made discretionary tax deductible contributions to the PHI Retirement Plan in the amounts of $85 million, $85 million and $30 million, respectively, which is expected to bring the PHI Retirement Plan assets to at least the funding target level for 2012 under the Pension Protection Act. For additional discussion of PHIs Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, see Note (10), Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI. Effective July 1, 2011, PHI approved revisions to certain of PHIs existing benefit programs, including the PHI Retirement Plan. The changes to the PHI Retirement Plan were effected in order to establish a more unified approach to PHIs retirement programs and to further align the benefits offered under PHIs retirement programs. The changes to the PHI Retirement Plan were effective on or after July 1, 2011 and affect the retirement benefits payable to approximately 750 of PHIs employees. All full time employees of PHI and certain subsidiaries are eligible to participate in the PHI Retirement Plan. Retirement benefits for all other employees remain unchanged. In the third quarter of 2011, PHI also approved a new, non qualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) which replaced PHIs two pre existing supplemental retirement plans, effective August 1, 2011. As of the effective date of the new SERP, the Conectiv SERP and the PHI Combined SERP were closed to new participants. The establishment of the new SERP is consistent with PHIs efforts to align retirement benefits for PHI and its subsidiaries with current market practices and to provide similarly situated participants with retirement benefits that are the same or similar in value as compared to the benefits provided under the prior SERPs. In the fourth quarter of 2011, PHI approved an increase in the medical benefit limits for certain employees in its postretirement health care benefit plan to align the limits with those provided to other employees. The amendment affects approximately 1,400 employees, of which 400 are retirees and 1,000 are active union employees. The effective date of the plan modification was January 1, 2012. The additional liabilities and expenses for the benefit plan modifications described above did not have a material impact on PHIs overall consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 73 PEPCO HOLDINGS Cash Flow Activity PHIs cash flows during 2011, 2010 and 2009 are summarized below: Cash Source (Use) 2011 2010 2009 (millions of dollars) Operating Activities $ 686 $ 813 $ 606 Investing Activities (747 ) 718 (860 ) Financing Activities 149 (1,556 ) (84 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 88 $ (25 ) $ (338 ) Operating Activities Cash flows from operating activities during 2011, 2010 and 2009 are summarized below: Cash Source (Use) 2011 2010 2009 (millions of dollars) Net Income from continuing operations $ 260 $ 139 $ 223 Non cash adjustments to net income 351 352 262 Pension contributions (110 ) (100 ) (300 ) Changes in cash collateral related to derivative activities 9 13 24 Changes in other assets and liabilities 134 161 294 Changes in Conectiv Energy net assets held for sale 42 248 103 Net cash from operating activities $ 686 $ 813 $ 606 Net cash from operating activities was $127 million lower for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010. The decrease was due primarily to a $206 million reduction in Conectiv Energy net assets held for sale as well as $10 million increase in pension contributions compared to 2010. A significant portion of the decline in Conectiv Energy assets held for sale was associated with the transfer of derivative instruments to a third party as further described in Note (20), Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI. Partially offsetting this decrease in operating cash flows was a $121 million increase in cash flows from continuing operations. Net cash from operating activities was $207 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. Portions of the increase are attributable to a 2010 decrease in pension plan contributions of $200 million compared to 2009 and a decrease in regulatory liabilities during 2010 that was the result of a lower rate of recovery by ACE of costs associated with energy and capacity purchased under the NUG contracts. Changes in cash from Conectiv Energy assets held for sale reflect a net decrease in Conectiv Energy assets and liabilities included in discontinued operations, including a decrease in collateral requirements as a result of the liquidation of derivative instruments. 74 PEPCO HOLDINGS Investing Activities Cash flows used by investing activities during 2011, 2010 and 2009 are summarized below: Cash (Use) Source 2011 2010 2009 (millions of dollars) Investment in property, plant and equipment $ (941 ) $ (802 ) $ (664 ) DOE capital reimbursement awards received 52 13 Proceeds from early termination of finance leases held in trust 161 Proceeds from sale of Conectiv Energy wholesale power generation business 1,640 Proceeds from sale of assets 3 4 Changes in restricted cash equivalents (10 ) (2 ) Net other investing activities (9 ) 4 Investment in property, plant and equipment associated with Conectiv Energy assets held for sale (138 ) (200 ) Net cash (used by) from investing activities $ (747 ) $ 718 $ (860 ) Net cash from investing activities decreased $1,465 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. The decrease was due primarily to the $1,640 million in proceeds from the sale of the Conectiv Energy wholesale power generation business and $139 million increase in capital expenditures, partially offset by the $161 million of proceeds from the early termination of certain cross border energy lease investments in 2011. Net cash from investing activities increased $1,578 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. The increase was due primarily to the $1,640 million proceeds from the sale of the Conectiv Energy wholesale power generation business offset by a $138 million increase in capital expenditures primarily attributable to capital costs associated with transmission plant investment and PHIs Blueprint for the Future initiatives. Financing Activities Cash flows from financing activities during 2011, 2010 and 2009 are summarized below. Cash (Use) Source 2011 2010 2009 (millions of dollars) Dividends paid on common stock $ (244 ) $ (241 ) $ (238 ) Common stock issued for the Dividend Reinvestment Plan and employee related compensation 47 47 49 Redemption of preferred stock of subsidiaries (6 ) Issuances of long term debt 235 383 110 Reacquisitions of long term debt (70 ) (1,726 ) (83 ) Issuances of short term debt, net 198 4 65 Cost of issuances (10 ) (7 ) (4 ) Net other financing activities (1 ) (6 ) 10 Net financing activities associated with Conectiv Energy assets held for sale (10 ) 7 Net cash from (used by) financing activities $ 149 $ (1,556 ) $ (84 ) 75 PEPCO HOLDINGS Net cash related to financing activities increased $1,705 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to a $1,656 million decrease in reacquisitions of long term debt in 2011 as a result of debt extinguishments in 2010. Net cash related to financing activities decreased $1,472 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to the retirement of $1,643 million of long term debt using the proceeds from the sale of the Conectiv Energy wholesale power generation business. Common Stock Dividends Common stock dividend payments were $244 million in 2011, $241 million in 2010, and $238 million in 2009. The increase in common stock dividends paid in 2011 and 2010 was the result of additional shares outstanding, primarily shares issued under the Shareholder Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP). Changes in Outstanding Common Stock Under the DRP, PHI issued 1.6 million shares of common stock in 2011, 1.8 million shares of common stock in 2010, and 2.2 million shares of common stock in 2009. Changes in Outstanding Long Term Debt Cash flows from the issuance and reacquisition of long term debt in 2011, 2010 and 2009 are summarized in the charts below: 2011 2010 2009 Issuances (millions of dollars) PHI 2.70% senior notes due 2015 $ $ 250 $ 250 Pepco 6.20% tax exempt bonds due 2022 (a) 110 110 DPL 0.75% tax exempt bonds due 2026 (b) 35 5.40% tax exempt bonds due 2031 (c) 78 1.80% tax exempt bonds due 2025 (d) 15 2.30% tax exempt bonds due 2028 (d) 16 35 109 ACE 4.35% First mortgage bonds due 2021 200 4.875% tax exempt bonds due 2029 (e) 23 200 23 Pepco Energy Services 1 $ 235 $ 383 $ 110 (a) Consists of Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds (Pepco 2022 Bonds) issued by the Maryland Economic Development Corporation for the benefit of Pepco that were purchased by Pepco in 2008.

The Pepco 2022 Bonds are secured by an outstanding series of senior notes issued by Pepco, and the senior notes are in turn secured by a series of collateral first mortgage bonds (Collateral First Mortgage Bonds) issued by Pepco. Both the senior notes and the Collateral First Mortgage Bonds have maturity dates, optional and mandatory redemption provisions, interest rates and interest payment dates that are identical to the terms of the Pepco 2022 Bonds. The payment by Pepco of its obligations with respect to the Pepco 2022 Bonds satisfies the corresponding payment obligations on the senior notes and Collateral First Mortgage Bonds. See Note (11), Debt, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI. (b) Consists of Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds issued by the Delaware Economic Development Authority (DEDA) for the benefit of DPL that were purchased by DPL in May 2011.

(d) Consists of Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds issued by DEDA for the benefit of DPL that were purchased by DPL in July 2010. See footnote (c) to the Reaquisitions table below. The bonds were resold to the public in December 2010. While DPL held the bonds, they remained outstanding as a contractual matter, but were considered extinguished for accounting purposes. In connection with the resale of the bonds, the interest rate on the bonds was changed (i) from 5.50% to a fixed rate of 1.80% with respect to the tax exempt bonds due 2025 and (ii) from 5.65% to a fixed rate of 2.30% with respect to the tax exempt bonds due 2028. The bonds are subject to mandatory purchase by DPL on June 1, 2012. (e) Consists of Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds (ACE Bonds) issued by The Pollution Control Financing Authority of Salem County for the benefit of ACE that were purchased by ACE in 2008. In connection with the resale by ACE, the interest rate on the ACE Bonds was changed from an auction rate to a fixed rate. The ACE Bonds are secured by an outstanding series of senior notes issued by ACE, and the senior notes are in turn secured by a series of Collateral First Mortgage Bonds issued by ACE. Both the senior notes and the Collateral First Mortgage Bonds have maturity dates, optional and mandatory redemption provisions, interest rates and interest payment dates that are identical to the terms of the ACE Bonds. The payment by ACE of its obligations with respect to the ACE Bonds satisfies the corresponding payment obligations on the senior notes and Collateral First Mortgage Bonds.

The Pepco 2010 Bonds were secured by an outstanding series of Collateral First Mortgage Bonds issued by Pepco. The Collateral First Mortgage Bonds had maturity dates, optional and mandatory redemption provisions, interest rates and interest payment dates that were identical to the terms of the Pepco 2010 Bonds. Accordingly, the redemption of the Pepco 2010 Bonds at maturity automatically effected the redemption of the Collateral First Mortgage Bonds. (b) Repurchased by DPL in May 2011 pursuant to a mandatory purchase provision in the indenture for the bonds. The bonds were resold by DPL in June 2011. See footnote (b) to the Issuances table above.

The bonds were resold by DPL in December 2010. See footnote (d) to the Issuances table above. 77 PEPCO HOLDINGS Purchase and Resale of Tax Exempt Auction Rate Bonds On June 1, 2011, DPL resold $35 million of Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds (Delmarva Power & Light Company Project) Series 2001C due 2026 (the Series 2001C Bonds). The Series 2001C Bonds were issued for the benefit of DPL in 2001 and were repurchased by DPL on May 2, 2011, pursuant to a mandatory repurchase provision in the indenture for the Series 2001C Bonds triggered by the expiration of the original interest rate period specified by the Series 2001C Bonds. See footnote (b) to the Reacquisitions table above. In connection with the issuance of the Series 2001C Bonds, DPL entered into a continuing disclosure agreement under which it is obligated to furnish certain information to the bondholders. At the time of the resale, the continuing disclosure agreement was amended and restated to designate the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board as the sole repository for these continuing disclosure documents. The amendment and restatement of the continuing disclosure agreement did not change the operating or financial data that are required to be provided by DPL under such agreement. On April 5, 2011, ACE issued $200 million of 4.35% first mortgage bonds due April 1, 2021. The net proceeds were used to repay short term debt and for general corporate purposes. In 2010, DEDA issued $78 million of 5.40% Gas Facilities Refunding Revenue Bonds due 2031 for the benefit of DPL. The proceeds were used by DPL to redeem $78 million in principal amount of Exempt Facilities Refunding Revenue Bonds issued by DEDA purchased in 2008. See footnote (c) to the Issuances table above. In March 2010, $23 million in aggregate principal amount of Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds were resold by ACE to the public. See footnote (e) to the Issuances table above. In 2009, Pepco resold Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds issued by the Maryland Economic Development Corporation in the aggregate principal amount of $110 million. See footnote (a) to the Issuances table above. In 2009, ACE redeemed $32 million in Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds. Changes in Short Term Debt As of December 31, 2011, PHI had a total of $586 million of commercial paper outstanding as compared to $388 million and $384 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2008 and 2009, the following insured Variable Rate Demand Bonds (VRDBs) issued by The Pollution Control Financing Authority of Salem County for the benefit of ACE were tendered to The Bank of New York Mellon, bond trustee, by the holders and purchased by The Bank of New York Mellon pursuant to standby bond purchase agreements for the respective series: $18.2 million of Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds 1997 Series A due 2014 (ACE 1997A Bonds), and $4.4 million of Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds 1997 Series B due 2017 (ACE 1997B Bonds). In June 2009, the ACE VRDBs were resold to the public. In connection with this remarketing, the financial guaranty insurance policies issued as credit support for the ACE VRDBs were cancelled and replaced with letters of credit. In June 2010, the letters of credit expired and were replaced with new irrevocable direct pay letters of credit. The new letter of credit supporting the ACE 1997A Bonds expires in April 2014 and the new letter of credit for the ACE 1997B Bonds expires in June 2013. The expiration, cancellation, or termination of a letter of credit prior to the maturity of the related VRDBs will require ACE to repurchase the corresponding series of ACE VRDBs. For a further description of the VRDBs issued by or for the benefit of PHIs utility subsidiaries, see Note (11), Debt, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI. 78 PEPCO HOLDINGS Capital Requirements Capital Expenditures Pepco Holdings capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2011 totaled $941 million, up $139 million versus $802 million in 2010. Capital expenditures in 2011 were $521 million for Pepco, $229 million for DPL, $138 million for ACE, $14 million for Pepco Energy Services and $39 million for Corporate and Other. The Power Delivery expenditures were primarily related to capital costs associated with new customer services, distribution reliability and transmission. Corporate and Other capital expenditures primarily consisted of hardware and software expenditures that will be allocated to Power Delivery when the assets are placed in service. The table below shows the projected capital expenditures for Power Delivery, Pepco Energy Services and Corporate and Other for the five year period 2012 through 2016. Pepco Holdings expects to fund these expenditures through internally generated cash and external financing. For the Year 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Total (millions of dollars) Power Delivery Distribution $ 601 $ 679 $ 729 $ 689 $ 711 $ 3,409 Distribution Blueprint for the Future 120 3 9 92 224 Transmission 305 260 278 255 258 1,356 Transmission MAPP 5 2 2 6 190 205 Gas Delivery 22 23 23 25 27 120 Other 140 80 50 39 49 358 Sub Total 1,193 1,047 1,082 1,023 1,327 5,672 DOE Capital Reimbursement Awards (a) (50 ) (3 ) (53 ) Total for Power Delivery 1,143 1,044 1,082 1,023 1,327 5,619 Pepco Energy Services 14 7 7 7 7 42 Corporate and Other 3 3 3 3 3 15 Total PHI $ 1,160 $ 1,054 $ 1,092 $ 1,033 $ 1,337 $ 5,676 (a) Reflects remaining anticipated reimbursements pursuant to awards from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. 79 PEPCO HOLDINGS Transmission and Distribution The projected capital expenditures listed in the table for distribution (other than Blueprint for the Future), transmission (other than the MAPP project) and gas delivery are primarily for facility replacements and upgrades to accommodate customer growth and service reliability, including capital expenditures for continuing reliability enhancement efforts. For a more detailed discussion of these efforts, see General Overview Reliability Enhancement and Emergency Restoration Improvement Plans. Infrastructure Investment Plan In 2009, the NJBPU approved ACEs proposed Infrastructure Investment Plan and the revenue requirement associated with recovering the cost of the related projects, subject to a prudency review in the next rate case. The approved projects were designed to enhance reliability of ACEs distribution system and support economic activity and job growth in New Jersey in the near term. ACE was granted cost recovery through an Infrastructure Investment Surcharge, which became effective on June 1, 2009. This approved plan was completed in 2011 and has added incremental capital spending of approximately $28 million since 2009. In 2011, ACE proposed a new Infrastructure Investment Plan that if approved by the NJBPU, would be expected to add an additional $63 million of capital spending for 2012, which is included in Distribution in the table above. Blueprint for the Future Each of PHIs utility subsidiaries have undertaken programs to install smart meters, further automate their electric distribution systems and enhance their communications infrastructure, which is referred to as the Blueprint for the Future. For a discussion of the Blueprint for the Future initiative, see General Overview Blueprint for the Future. The projected capital expenditures over the next five years are shown as Distribution Blueprint for the Future in the table above. MAPP Project PJM has approved the construction of a new 152 mile, interstate transmission line as part of PJMs regional transmission expansion plan. In August 2011, PJM notified PHI that the scheduled in service date for MAPP has been delayed from June 1, 2015 to the 2019 to 2021 time period. The projected capital expenditures over the next five years are shown as Transmission MAPP in the table above. MAPP/DOE Loan Program To assist in the funding of the MAPP project, PHI has applied for a $684 million loan guarantee from the DOE for a substantial portion of the MAPP project, primarily the Calvert Cliffs to Indian River segment. The application has been made under a federal loan guarantee program for projects that employ innovative energy efficiency, renewable energy and advanced transmission and distribution technologies. If granted, PHI believes the guarantee could allow PHI to acquire financing at a 80 PEPCO HOLDINGS lower cost than it would otherwise be able to obtain in the capital markets. Whether PHIs application will be granted and, if so, the amount of debt guaranteed is subject to the discretion of the DOE and the negotiation of terms that will satisfy the conditions of the guarantee program. On February 28, 2011, the DOE issued a Notice of Intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement to assist the DOE in assessing the environmental impact of constructing the portion of the MAPP project to be supported by the loan guarantee. Since February 2011, the DOE has conducted field inspections of the entire route and has held public meetings to obtain input from the communities along the route. The DOEs review of the loan guarantee program has delayed the DOEs review of PHIs loan guarantee application. There is not an approval deadline under the loan guarantee program, but this program could change or be terminated in the future. PHI continues to coordinate environmental activities with the DOE. DOE Capital Reimbursement Awards In 2009, the DOE announced awards under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 of: $105 million and $44 million in Pepcos Maryland and District of Columbia service territories, respectively, for the implementation of an advanced metering infrastructure system, direct load control, distribution automation, and communications infrastructure. $19 million to ACE for the implementation of direct load control, distribution automation, and communications infrastructure in its New Jersey service territory. In April 2010, PHI and the DOE signed agreements formalizing the $168 million in awards. Of the $168 million, $130 million is expected to offset incurred and projected Blueprint for the Future and other capital expenditures of Pepco and ACE. The remaining $38 million will be used to offset incremental expenses associated with direct load control and other Pepco and ACE programs. In 2011, Pepco received award payments of $53 million and ACE received award payments of $6 million. In 2010, Pepco received award payments of $15 million and ACE received award payments of $2 million. The IRS has announced that, to the extent these grants are expended on capital items, they will not be considered taxable income. Dividends Pepco Holdings annual dividend rate on its common stock is determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration, among other factors, current and possible future developments that may affect PHIs income and cash flows. In 2011, PHIs Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of 27 cents per share of common stock payable on March 31, 2011, June 30, 2011, September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2011. On January 26, 2012, the Board of Directors declared a dividend on common stock of 27 cents per share payable March 30, 2012, to shareholders of record on March 12, 2012. PHI, on a stand alone basis, generates no operating income of its own. Accordingly, its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders depends on dividends received from its subsidiaries. In addition to their future financial performance, the ability of each of PHIs direct and indirect subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to limits imposed by: (i) state corporate laws, which impose limitations on the funds that can be used to pay dividends and when such dividends can be paid, and, in the case of ACE, the regulatory requirement that it obtain the prior approval of the NJBPU before dividends can be paid if its equity as a percent of its total capitalization, excluding securitization debt, falls below 30%; (ii) the prior rights of holders of existing and future mortgage bonds and other long term debt issued by the subsidiaries, and any preferred stock that may be issued by the subsidiaries in the future, (iii) any other restrictions imposed in connection with the incurrence of liabilities; and (iv) certain provisions of ACEs charter that impose restrictions on payment of common stock dividends for the benefit of preferred stockholders. None of Pepco, DPL or ACE currently have shares of preferred stock outstanding. Currently, the capitalization ratio limitation to which ACE is subject and the restriction in the ACE charter do not limit ACEs ability to pay common stock dividends. PHI had approximately $1,072 million and $1,059 million of retained earnings free of restrictions at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These amounts represent the total retained earnings balances at those dates. 81 PEPCO HOLDINGS Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Summary information about Pepco Holdings consolidated contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2011, is as follows: Contractual Maturity Obligation Total Lessthan 1Year 1 3Years 3 5Years After 5Years (millions of dollars) Variable Rate Demand Bonds $ 146 $ 146 $ $ $ Commercial paper 586 586 Long term debt (a) 4,211 111 892 747 2,461 Long term project funding 15 2 4 3 6 Interest payments on debt 3,162 244 441 365 2,112 Capital leases 121 15 30 30 46 Operating leases 530 39 71 61 359 Estimated pension and OPEB plan contributions 235 235 Non derivative fuel and purchase power contracts (b) 4,102 553 716 708 2,125 Total (c) $ 13,108 $ 1,931 $ 2,154 $ 1,914 $ 7,109 (a) Includes transition bonds issued by ACE Funding. (b) Excludes contracts for the purchase of electricity to satisfy Default Electricity Supply load service obligations which have neither a fixed commitment amount nor a minimum purchase amount. In addition, costs are recoverable from customers. (c) Excludes $180 million of net non current liabilities related to uncertain tax positions due to uncertainty in the timing of the associated cash payments. Third Party Guarantees, Indemnifications and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements PHI and certain of its subsidiaries have various financial and performance guarantees and indemnification obligations that they have entered into in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. As of December 31, 2011, PHI and its subsidiaries were parties to a variety of agreements pursuant to which they were guarantors for standby letters of credit, energy procurement obligations, and other commitments and obligations. Such agreements include performance and payment guarantees of PHI aggregating $175 million related to Pepco Energy Services. For additional discussion of PHIs third party guarantees, indemnifications, obligations and off balance sheet arrangements, see Note (17), Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI. 82 PEPCO HOLDINGS Energy Contract Activity The following table provides detail on changes in the net asset or liability positions of the Pepco Energy Services segment with respect to energy commodity contracts for the year ended December 31, 2011. The balances in the table are pre tax and the derivative assets and liabilities reflect netting by counterparty before the impact of collateral. EnergyCommodityActivities (a) (millions of dollars) Total Fair Value of Energy Contract Net Liabilities at December 31, 2010 $ (135 ) Current period unrealized losses (30 ) Effective portion of changes in fair value recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Cash flow hedge ineffectiveness recorded in income (1 ) Reclassification to realized on settlement of contracts 83 Total Fair Value of Energy Contract Net Liabilities at December 31, 2011 $ (83 ) Detail of Fair Value of Energy Contract Net Liabilities at December 31, 2011 (see above) Derivative liabilities (current liabilities) $ (81 ) Derivative liabilities (non current liabilities) (2 ) Total Fair Value of Energy Contract Liabilities (83 ) Total Fair Value of Energy Contract Net Liabilities $ (83 ) (a) Includes all effective hedging activities from continuing operations recorded at fair value through Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) or trading activities from continuing operations recorded at fair value in the consolidated statements of income. The $83 million net liability on energy contracts at December 31, 2011 was primarily attributable to losses on power swaps and natural gas futures held by Pepco Energy Services. Pepco Energy Services net liability decreased to $83 million at December 31, 2011 from $135 million at December 31, 2010 primarily due to settlements of the derivatives. PHI expects that future revenues from existing customer sales obligations that are accounted for on an accrual basis will largely offset expected realized net losses on Pepco Energy Services energy contracts. 83 PEPCO HOLDINGS PHI uses its best estimates to determine the fair value of the commodity derivative contracts that are entered into by Pepco Energy Services. The fair values in each category presented below reflect forward prices and volatility factors as of December 31, 2011, and the fair values are subject to change as a result of changes in these prices and factors. As of December 31, 2011, all of these contracts were held by Pepco Energy Services.

(c) Modeled values include significant inputs, usually representing more than 10% of the valuation, not readily observable in the market. The modeled valuation above represents the fair valuation of certain long dated power transactions based on limited observable broker prices extrapolated for periods beyond two years into the future. Contractual Arrangements with Credit Rating Triggers or Margining Rights Under certain contractual arrangements entered into by PHIs subsidiaries, the subsidiary may be required to provide cash collateral or letters of credit as security for its contractual obligations if the credit ratings of PHI or the subsidiary are downgraded. In the event of a downgrade, the amount required to be posted would depend on the amount of the underlying contractual obligation existing at the time of the downgrade. Based on contractual provisions in effect at December 31, 2011, a downgrade in the unsecured debt credit ratings of PHI or each of its rated subsidiaries to below investment grade would increase the collateral obligation of PHI and its subsidiaries by up to $233 million, none of which is related to the discontinued operations of Conectiv Energy, and $124 million of which is the net settlement amount attributable to derivatives, normal purchase and normal sale contracts, collateral, and other contracts under master netting agreements as described in Note (15), Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI. The remaining $109 million of the collateral obligation that would be incurred in the event PHI were downgraded to below investment grade is attributable primarily to energy services contracts and accounts payable to independent system operators and distribution companies on full requirements contracts entered into by Pepco Energy Services. PHI believes that it and its subsidiaries currently have sufficient liquidity to fund their operations and meet their financial obligations. Many of the contractual arrangements entered into by PHIs subsidiaries in connection with competitive energy and Default Electricity Supply activities include margining rights pursuant to which the PHI subsidiary or a counterparty may request collateral if the market value of the contractual obligations reaches levels in excess of the credit thresholds established in the applicable arrangements. Pursuant to these margining rights, the affected PHI subsidiary may receive, or be required to post, collateral due to energy price movements. As of December 31, 2011, Pepco Energy Services provided net cash collateral in the amount of $112 million in connection with these activities. 84 PEPCO HOLDINGS Environmental Remediation Obligations PHIs accrued liabilities for environmental remediation obligations as of December 31, 2011 totaled $30 million, of which approximately $6 million is expected to be incurred in 2012, for potential environmental cleanup and related costs at sites owned or formerly owned by an operating subsidiary where an operating subsidiary is a potentially responsible party or is alleged to be a third party contributor. For further information concerning the remediation obligations associated with these sites, see Note (17), Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI. For information regarding projected expenditures for environmental control facilities, see Business Environmental Matters. The most significant environmental remediation obligations as of December 31, 2011, are for the following items: Environmental investigation and remediation costs payable by Pepco with respect to the Benning Road site. Amounts payable by DPL in accordance with a 2001 consent agreement reached with the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, for remediation, site restoration, natural resource damage compensatory projects and other costs associated with environmental contamination that resulted from an oil release at the Indian River power plant, which DPL sold in June 2001. Potential compliance remediation costs under New Jerseys Industrial Site Recovery Act payable by PHI associated with the retained environmental exposure from the sale of the Conectiv Energy wholesale power generation business. Amounts payable by DPL in connection with the Wilmington Coal Gas South site located in Wilmington, Delaware, to remediate residual material from the historical operation of a manufactured gas plant. Sources of Capital Pepco Holdings sources to meet its long term funding needs, such as capital expenditures, dividends, and new investments, and its short term funding needs, such as working capital and the temporary funding of long term funding needs, include internally generated funds, issuances by PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE under their commercial paper programs, securities issuances, short term loans, and bank financing under new or existing facilities. PHIs ability to generate funds from its operations and to access capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties. Volatile and deteriorating financial market conditions, diminished liquidity and tightening credit may affect access to certain of PHIs potential funding sources. See Risk Factors, for additional discussion of important factors that may impact these sources of capital. Cash Flow from Operations Cash flow generated by regulated utility subsidiaries in Power Delivery is the primary source of PHIs cash flow from operations. Additional cash flows are generated by the business of Pepco Energy Services and from the occasional sale of non core assets. Short Term Funding Sources Pepco Holdings and its regulated utility subsidiaries have traditionally used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs, such as commercial paper, short term notes and bank lines of credit. Proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs but may also be used to temporarily fund long term capital requirements. 85 PEPCO HOLDINGS As of December 31, 2011, Pepco Holdings, Pepco, DPL and ACE each maintains an ongoing commercial paper program pursuant to which each entity has the ability to issue up to $875 million, $500 million, $500 million and $250 million, respectively, of commercial paper. In January 2012, the PHI Board of Directors approved an increase in the maximum amount of commercial paper that PHI is authorized to issue under its commercial paper program to $1.25 billion. The commercial paper can be issued with maturities of up to 270 days. Long Term Funding Sources The sources of long term funding for PHI and its subsidiaries are the issuance of debt and equity securities and borrowing under long term credit agreements. Proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements, such as capital expenditures and new investments, and to repay or refinance existing indebtedness. Regulatory Restrictions on Financing Activities The issuance of debt securities by PHIs principal subsidiaries requires the approval of either FERC or one or more state public utility commissions. Neither FERC approval nor state public utility commission approval is required as a condition to the issuance of securities by PHI. State Financing Authority Pepcos long term financing activities (including the issuance of securities and the incurrence of debt) are subject to authorization by the DCPSC and MPSC. DPLs long term financing activities are subject to authorization by the MPSC and the DPSC. ACEs long term and short term (consisting of debt instruments with a maturity of one year or less) financing activities are subject to authorization by the NJBPU. Each utility, through periodic filings with the state public service commission(s) having jurisdiction over its financing activities, has maintained standing authority sufficient to cover its projected financing needs over a multi year period. FERC Financing Authority Under the Federal Power Act (FPA), FERC has jurisdiction over the issuance of long term and short term securities of public utilities, but only if the issuance is not regulated by the state public utility commission in which the public utility is organized and operating. Under these provisions, FERC has jurisdiction over the issuance of short term debt by Pepco and DPL. Pepco and DPL have obtained FERC authority for the issuance of short term debt. Because Pepco Energy Services also qualifies as a public utility under the FPA and is not regulated by a state utility commission, FERC also has jurisdiction over the issuance of securities by Pepco Energy Services. Pepco Energy Services has obtained the requisite FERC financing authority in its market based rate orders. Money Pool Pepco Holdings operates a system money pool under a blanket authorization adopted by FERC. The money pool is a cash management mechanism used by Pepco Holdings to manage the short term investment and borrowing requirements of its subsidiaries that participate in the money pool. Pepco Holdings may invest in but not borrow from the money pool. Eligible subsidiaries with surplus cash may deposit those funds in the money pool. Deposits in the money pool are guaranteed by Pepco Holdings. Eligible subsidiaries with cash requirements may borrow from the money pool. Borrowings from the money pool are unsecured. Depositors in the money pool receive, and borrowers from the money pool pay, an interest rate based primarily on Pepco Holdings short term borrowing rate. Pepco Holdings deposits funds in the money pool to the extent that the pool has insufficient funds to meet the borrowing needs of its participants, which may require Pepco Holdings to borrow funds for deposit from external sources. 86 PEPCO HOLDINGS Regulatory And Other Matters Rate Proceedings Distribution The rates that each of Pepco, DPL and ACE is permitted to charge for the retail distribution of electricity and natural gas to its various classes of customers are based on the principle that the utility is entitled to generate an amount of revenue sufficient to recover the cost of providing the service, including a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital. These base rates are intended to cover all of each utilitys reasonable and prudent expenses of constructing, operating and maintaining its distribution facilities (other than costs covered by specific cost recovery surcharges). A change in base rates in a jurisdiction requires the approval of public service commission. In the rate application submitted to the public service commission, the utility specifies an increase in its revenue requirement, which is the additional revenue that the utility is seeking authorization to earn. The revenue requirement consists of (i) the allowable expenses incurred by the utility, including operation and maintenance expenses, taxes and depreciation, and (ii) the utilitys cost of capital. The compensation of the utility for its cost of capital takes the form of an overall rate of return allowed by the public service commission on the utilitys distribution rate base to compensate the utilitys investors for their debt and equity investments in the company. The rate base is the aggregate value of the investment in property used by the utility in providing electricity and natural gas distribution services and generally consists of plant in service net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated deferred taxes, plus cash working capital, material and operating supplies and, depending on the jurisdiction, construction work in progress. Over time, the rate base is increased by utility property additions and reduced by depreciation and property retirements and write offs. In addition to its base rates, some of the costs of providing distribution service are recovered through the operation of surcharges. Examples of costs recovered by PHIs utility subsidiaries through surcharges, which vary depending on the jurisdiction, include: a surcharge to reimburse the utility for the cost of purchasing electricity from NUGs (New Jersey); surcharges to reimburse the utility for costs of public interest programs for low income customers (New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware and the District of Columbia); a surcharge to pay the Transitional Bond Charge (New Jersey); and surcharges to reimburse the utility for certain environmental costs (Delaware and Maryland). Each utility subsidiary regularly reviews its distribution rates in each jurisdiction of its service territory, and from time to time files applications to adjust its rates as necessary in an effort to ensure that its revenues are sufficient to cover its operating expenses and its cost of capital. The timing of future rate filings and the change in the distribution rate requested will depend on a number of factors, including changes in revenues and expenses and the incurrence or the planned incurrence of capital expenditures. In the third quarter of 2011, Pepco filed an electric distribution base rate increase application in the District of Columbia and ACE filed an electric distribution base rate increase application in New Jersey. In the fourth quarter of 2011, DPL filed an electric distribution base rate increase application in Delaware and Maryland. Also in the fourth quarter of 2011, Pepco filed an electric distribution base rate increase application in Maryland. DPL currently expects to file a natural gas distribution base rate increase application in early 2013. In general, a request for new distribution rates is made on the basis of test year balances for rate base allowable operating expenses and a requested rate of return. The test year amounts used in the filing may be historical or partially projected. The public service commission may, however, select a different test period than that proposed by the company. Although the approved tariff rates are intended to be forward looking, and therefore provide for the recovery of some future changes in rate base and operating costs, they typically do not reflect all of the changes in costs for the period in which the new rates are in effect. 87 PEPCO HOLDINGS If revenues do not keep pace with increases in costs, this situation will result in a lag between when the costs are incurred and when the utility can begin to recover those costs through its rates. The following table shows, for each of the PHI utility subsidiaries, the authorized return on equity as determined in the most recently concluded base rate proceeding and the date as of which the rate as determined in the proceeding was implemented: Rate Base (In millions) AuthorizedReturn onEquity Rate EffectiveDate Pepco: District of Columbia (electricity) 9.625% March 2010 Maryland (electricity) 9.83% August 2010 DPL: Delaware (electricity) 10.00% April 2010 Maryland (electricity) Not specified(a) July 2011 Delaware (natural gas) 10.00% February 2011 ACE: New Jersey (electricity) 10.30% June 2010 (a) Cost of equity at 10% for purposes of calculating allowance for funds used during construction and regulatory asset carrying costs. Transmission The rates Pepco, DPL and ACE are permitted to charge for the transmission of electricity are regulated by FERC and are based on each utilitys transmission rate base, transmission operating expenses and an overall rate of return that is approved by FERC. For each utility subsidiary, FERC has approved a formula for the calculation of the utility transmission rate, which is referred to as a formula rate. The formula rates include both fixed and variable elements. Certain of the fixed elements, such as the return on equity and depreciation rates, can be changed only in a FERC rate proceeding. The variable elements of the formula, including the utilitys rate base and operating expenses, are updated annually, effective June 1 of each year, with data from the utilitys most recent annual FERC Form 1 filing. In addition to its formula rate, each utilitys return on equity is supplemented by incentive rates, sometimes referred to as adders, and other incentives, which are authorized by FERC to promote capital investment in transmission infrastructure. In connection with the MAPP project, FERC has authorized for each of Pepco and DPL a 150 basis point adder to its return on equity, resulting in a FERC approved rate of return on the MAPP project of 12.8%, along with full recovery of construction work in progress and prudently incurred abandoned plant costs. Additional return on equity adders are in effect for each of Pepco, DPL and ACE relating to specific transmission upgrades and improvements, as well as in consideration for each utilitys continued membership in PJM. As members of PJM, the transmission rates of Pepco, DPL and ACE are set out in PJMs Open Access Transmission Tariff. For a discussion of pending state public utility commission and FERC rate proceedings, see Note (7), Regulatory Matters, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI. 88 PEPCO HOLDINGS Legal Proceedings and Regulatory Matters For a discussion of legal proceedings, see Note (17), Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI, and for a discussion of regulatory matters, see Note (7), Regulatory Matters, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI. Critical Accounting Policies General PHI has identified the following accounting policies that result in having to make certain estimates that, as a result of the judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved, could result in material changes in its financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions. PHI has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Goodwill Impairment Evaluation Substantially all of PHIs goodwill was generated by Pepcos acquisition of Conectiv in 2002 and is allocated entirely to the Power Delivery reporting unit for purposes of assessing impairment under FASB guidance on goodwill and other intangibles (ASC 350). Management has identified Power Delivery as a single reporting unit because its components have similar economic characteristics, similar products and services and operate in a similar regulatory environment. PHI tests its goodwill impairment at least annually as of November 1 and on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Factors that may result in an interim impairment test include, but are not limited to: a change in identified reporting units; an adverse change in business conditions; a protracted decline in stock price causing market capitalization to fall below book value; an adverse regulatory action; or impairment of long lived assets in the reporting unit. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. Management uses its best judgment to make reasonable projections of future cash flows for Power Delivery when estimating the reporting units fair value. In addition, PHI selects a discount rate for the associated risk with those estimated cash flows. These judgments are inherently uncertain, and actual results could vary from those used in PHIs estimates. The impact of such variations could significantly alter the results of a goodwill impairment test, which could materially impact the estimated fair value of Power Delivery and potentially the amount of any impairment recorded in the financial statements. PHIs November 1, 2011 annual impairment test indicated that its goodwill was not impaired. See Note (6), Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI. In order to estimate the fair value of the Power Delivery reporting unit, PHI uses two valuation techniques: an income approach and a market approach. The income approach estimates fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis using estimated future cash flows and a terminal value that is consistent with Power Deliverys long term view of the business. This approach uses a discount rate based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the reporting unit. PHI determines the estimated WACC by considering market based information for the cost of equity and cost of debt that is appropriate for Power Delivery as of the measurement date. The market approach estimates fair value based on a multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) that management believes is consistent with EBITDA multiples for comparable utilities. PHI has consistently used this valuation framework to estimate the fair value of Power Delivery. 89 PEPCO HOLDINGS The estimation of fair value is dependent on a number of factors that are sourced from the Power Delivery reporting units business forecast, including but not limited to interest rates, growth assumptions, returns on rate base, operating and capital expenditure requirements, and other factors, changes in which could materially impact the results of impairment testing. Assumptions and methodologies used in the models were consistent with historical experience. A hypothetical 10 percent decrease in fair value of the Power Delivery reporting unit at November 1, 2011 would not have resulted in the Power Delivery reporting unit failing the first step of the impairment test, as defined in the guidance, as the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would have been above its carrying value. Sensitive, interrelated and uncertain variables that could decrease the estimated fair value of the Power Delivery reporting unit include utility sector market performance, sustained adverse business conditions, change in forecasted revenues, higher operating and maintenance capital expenditure requirements, a significant increase in the cost of capital, and other factors. PHI believes that the estimates involved in its goodwill impairment evaluation process represent Critical Accounting Estimates because they are subjective and susceptible to change from period to period as management makes assumptions and judgments, and the impact of a change in assumptions and estimates could be material to financial results. Long Lived Assets Impairment Evaluation PHI believes that the estimates involved in its long lived asset impairment evaluation process represent Critical Accounting Estimates because (i) they are highly susceptible to change from period to period because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about when events indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable and how to estimate undiscounted and discounted future cash flows and fair values, which are inherently uncertain, (ii) actual results could vary from those used in PHIs estimates and the impact of such variations could be material, and (iii) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on PHIs assets as well as the net loss related to an impairment charge could be material. The primary assets subject to a long lived asset impairment evaluation are property, plant, and equipment. The FASB guidance on the accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets (ASC 360), requires that certain long lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, such as (i) a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset or asset group, (ii) a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition, (iii) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, (iv) an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset or asset group, (v) a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group, and (vi) a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. An impairment loss may only be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. The asset is deemed not to be recoverable when its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. In order to estimate an assets future cash flows, PHI considers historical cash flows. PHI uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel costs, legislative initiatives, and operating costs. If necessary, the process of determining fair value is performed consistently with the process described in assessing the fair value of goodwill discussed above. 90 PEPCO HOLDINGS Accounting for Derivatives PHI believes that the estimates involved in accounting for its derivative instruments represent Critical Accounting Estimates because management exercises judgment in the following areas, any of which could have a material impact on its financial statements: (i) the application of the definition of a derivative to contracts to identify derivatives, (ii) the election of the normal purchases and normal sales exception from derivative accounting, (iii) the application of cash flow hedge accounting, and (iv) the estimation of fair value used in the measurement of derivatives and hedged items, which are highly susceptible to changes in value over time due to market trends or, in certain circumstances, significant uncertainties in modeling techniques used to measure fair value that could result in actual results being materially different from PHIs estimates. See Note (2), Significant Accounting Policies Accounting for Derivatives, and Note (15), Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI. PHI and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments primarily to manage risk associated with commodity prices. The definition of a derivative in the FASB guidance results in management having to exercise judgment, such as whether there is a notional amount or net settlement provision in contracts. Management assesses a number of factors before determining whether it can designate derivatives for the normal purchase or normal sale exception from derivative accounting, including whether it is probable that the contracts will physically settle with delivery of the underlying commodity. The application of cash flow hedge accounting often requires judgment in the prospective and retrospective assessment and measurement of hedge effectiveness as well as whether it is probable that the forecasted transaction will occur. The fair value of derivatives is determined using quoted exchange prices where available. For instruments that are not traded on an exchange, external broker quotes are used to determine fair value. For some custom and complex instruments, internal models use market information when external broker quotes are not available. For certain long dated instruments, broker or exchange data is extrapolated for future periods where information is limited. Models are also used to estimate volumes for certain transactions. The same valuation methods are used for risk management purposes to determine the value of non derivative, commodity exposure. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans PHI believes that the estimates involved in reporting the costs of providing pension and OPEB benefits represent Critical Accounting Estimates because (i) they are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of assumptions which are subjective in nature, (ii) they are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience, and (iii) changes in assumptions could impact PHIs expected future cash funding requirements for the plans and would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations, which affect the reported amount of annual net periodic pension and OPEB cost on the income statement. Assumptions about the future, including the discount rate applied to benefit obligations, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, the anticipated rate of increase in health care costs and participant compensation have a significant impact on employee benefit costs. The discount rate for determining the pension benefit obligation was 5.00% and 5.65% as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The discount rate for determining the postretirement benefit obligation was 4.90% and 5.60% as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. PHI utilizes an analytical tool developed by its actuaries to select the discount rate. The analytical tool utilizes a high quality bond portfolio with cash flows that match the benefit payments expected to be made under the plans. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets was 7.75% and 8.00% as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. PHI uses a building block approach to estimate the expected rate of return on plan assets. Under this approach, the percentage of plan assets in each asset class according to PHIs target asset allocation, at the beginning of the year, is applied to the expected asset return for the related asset class. PHI incorporates long term assumptions for real returns, inflation expectations, volatility, and correlations among asset classes to determine expected returns for the related asset class. The plan assets consist of equity, fixed income, real estate and private equity investments. The plan assets are expected to yield a return on assets of 7.75% as of December 31, 2011 when viewed over a long term horizon. 91 PEPCO HOLDINGS The following table reflects the effect on the projected benefit obligation for the pension plan and the accumulated benefit obligation for the OPEB plan, as well as the net periodic cost for both plans, if there were changes in these critical actuarial assumptions while holding all other actuarial assumptions constant: (in millions, except percentages) Change inAssumptions Impact onBenefitObligation ProjectedIncrease in2011 NetPeriodic Cost Pension Plan Discount rate (0.25 )% $ 61 $ 5 Expected return (0.25 )% (a) 5 Postretirement Benefit Plan Discount rate (0.25 )% $ 20 $ 1 Expected return (0.25 )% (a) 1 Health care cost trend rate 1.00 % 32 2 (a) A change in the expected return assumption has no impact on the Projected Benefit Obligation. The impact of changes in assumptions and the difference between actual and expected or estimated results on pension and postretirement obligations is generally recognized over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans rather than immediate recognition in the statements of income. For additional discussion, see Note (10), Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI. Accounting for Regulated Activities FASB guidance on the accounting for regulated activities, Regulated Operations (ASC 980), applies to Power Delivery and can result in the deferral of costs or revenue that would otherwise be recognized by non regulated entities. PHI defers the recognition of costs and records regulatory assets when it is probable that those costs will be recovered in future customer rates. PHI defers the recognition of revenues and records regulatory liabilities when it is probable that it will refund payments received from customers in the future or that it will incur future costs related to the payments currently received from customers. PHI believes that the judgments involved in accounting for its regulated activities represent Critical Accounting Estimates because (i) management must interpret laws and regulatory commission orders to assess the probability of the recovery of costs in customer rates or the return of revenues to customers when determining whether those costs or revenues should be deferred, (ii) decisions made by regulatory commissions or legislative changes at a later date could vary from earlier interpretations made by management and the impact of such variations could be material, and (iii) the elimination of a regulatory asset because deferred costs are no longer probable of recovery in future customer rates could have a material negative impact on PHIs assets and earnings. Managements most significant judgment is whether to defer costs or revenues when there is not a current regulatory order specific to the item being considered for deferral. In those cases, management considers relevant historical precedents of the regulatory commissions, the results of recent rate orders, and any new information from its more current interactions with the regulatory commissions on that item. Management regularly evaluates whether it should defer costs or revenues and reviews whether adjustments to its previous conclusions regarding its regulatory assets and liabilities are necessary based on the current regulatory and legislative environment as well as recent rate orders. 92 PEPCO HOLDINGS For additional discussion, see Note (7), Regulatory Matters, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI. Unbilled Revenue Unbilled revenue represents an estimate of revenue earned from services rendered by PHIs utility operations that have not yet been billed. PHIs utility operations calculate unbilled revenue using an output based methodology. The calculation is based on the supply of electricity or natural gas distributed to customers but not yet billed, adjusted for estimated line losses (estimates of electricity and gas expected to be lost in the process of a utilitys transmission and distribution to customers). PHI estimates involved in its unbilled revenue process represent Critical Accounting Estimates because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about input factors to the unbilled revenue calculation. Specifically, the determination of estimated line losses is inherently uncertain. Estimated line losses is defined as the estimates of electricity and natural gas expected to be lost in the process of its transmission and distribution to customers. A change in estimated line losses can change the output available for sale which is a factor in the unbilled revenue calculation. Certain factors can influence the estimated line losses such as weather and a change in customer mix. These factors may vary between companies due to geography and density of service territory, and the impact of changes in these factors could be material. PHI seeks to reduce the risk of an inaccurate estimate of unbilled revenue through corroboration of the estimate with historical information and other metrics. Accounting for Income Taxes PHI exercises significant judgment about the outcome of income tax matters in its application of the FASB guidance on accounting for income taxes and believes it represents a Critical Accounting Estimate because: (i) it records a current tax liability for estimated current tax expense on its federal and state tax returns; (ii) it records deferred tax assets for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return determination of pre tax income and the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are more likely than not going to result in tax deductions in future years; (iii) it determines whether a valuation allowance is needed against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion of the future tax deductions will not be realized; (iv) it records deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return determination of pre tax income and the carrying amount of assets and liabilities if it is more likely than not that they are expected to result in tax payments in future years; (v) the measurement of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities requires it to estimate future effective tax rates and future taxable income on its federal and state tax returns; (vi) it asserts that foreign earnings will continue to be indefinitely reinvested abroad; (vii) it must consider the effect of newly enacted tax law on its estimated effective tax rate and in measuring deferred tax balances; and (viii) it asserts that tax positions in its tax returns or expected to be taken in its tax returns are more likely than not to be sustained assuming that the tax positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements. Assumptions, judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard (that is, the cumulative result for a greater than 50% chance of being realized) has been met when developing the provision for current and deferred income taxes and the associated current and deferred tax assets and liabilities. PHIs assumptions, judgments and estimates take into account current tax laws and regulations, interpretation of current tax laws and regulations, the impact of newly enacted tax laws and regulations, developments in case law, settlements of tax positions, and the possible outcomes of current and future investigations conducted by tax authorities. PHI has established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. Although PHI believes that these assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws and regulations or its interpretation of tax laws and regulations as well as the resolutions of the current and any future investigations or legal proceedings could significantly impact the financial results from applying the accounting for income taxes in the consolidated financial statements. PHI reviews its application of the more likely than not standard quarterly. 93 PEPCO HOLDINGS PHI also evaluates quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or successfully implement tax planning strategies may affect the realization of deferred tax assets and the amount of any associated valuation allowance. The forecast of future taxable income is dependent on a number of factors that can change over time, including growth assumptions, business conditions, returns on rate base, operating and capital expenditures, cost of capital, tax laws and regulations, the legal structure of entities and other factors, which could materially impact the realizability of deferred tax assets and the associated financial results in the consolidated financial statements. New Accounting Standards and Pronouncements For information concerning new accounting standards and pronouncements that have recently been adopted by PHI and its subsidiaries or that one or more of the companies will be required to adopt on or before a specified date in the future, see Note (3), Newly Adopted Accounting Standards, and Note (4), Recently Issued Accounting Standards, Not Yet Adopted, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI. 94 PEPCO MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Potomac Electric Power Company Pepco meets the conditions set forth in General Instruction I(1)(a) and (b) to Form 10 K, and accordingly information otherwise required under this Item has been omitted in accordance with General Instruction I(2)(a) to Form 10 K. General Overview Pepco is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity in the District of Columbia and major portions of Montgomery County and Prince Georges County in suburban Maryland. Pepco also provides Default Electricity Supply, which is the supply of electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territories who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier. Default Electricity Supply is known as SOS in both the District of Columbia and Maryland. Pepcos service territory covers approximately 640 square miles and has a population of approximately 2.2 million. As of December 31, 2011, approximately 57% of delivered electricity sales were to Maryland customers and approximately 43% were to the District of Columbia customers. For retail customers of Pepco in Maryland and in the District of Columbia, earnings are not affected by the warmest and coldest periods of the year because a BSA for retail customers was implemented that recognizes distribution revenue based on an approved distribution charge per customer. Consequently, distribution revenue recognized is decoupled in a reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period and the only factors that will cause distribution revenue recognized in Maryland and the District of Columbia to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer. Changes in customer usage (such as due to weather conditions, energy prices, energy efficiency programs or other reasons) from period to period have no impact on reported distribution revenue for customers to whom the BSA applies. In accounting for the BSA in Maryland and the District of Columbia, a Revenue Decoupling Adjustment is recorded representing either (i) a positive adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from Maryland and District of Columbia retail distribution sales falls short of the revenue that Pepco is entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer or (ii) a negative adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from such distribution sales exceeds the revenue that Pepco is entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer. Pepco is a wholly owned subsidiary of PHI. Because PHI is a public utility holding company subject to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005), the relationship between PHI and Pepco and certain activities of Pepco are subject to FERCs regulatory oversight under PUHCA 2005. Reliability Enhancement and Emergency Restoration Improvement Plans In 2010, Pepco announced that it had adopted and begun to implement comprehensive reliability enhancement plans in Maryland and the District of Columbia. These reliability enhancement plans include various initiatives to improve electrical system reliability, such as: enhanced vegetation management; the identification and upgrading of under performing feeder lines; the addition of new facilities to support load; the installation of distribution automation systems on both the overhead and underground network system; the rejuvenation and replacement of underground residential cables; improvements to substation supply lines; and selective undergrounding of portions of existing above ground primary feeder lines, where appropriate to improve reliability. During 2011, Pepco invested $120 million in capital expenditures on these reliability enhancement activities. In 2011, prior to the start of the summer storm season, Pepco initiated a program to improve its emergency restoration efforts that included, among other initiatives, an expansion and enhancement of customer service capabilities. Blueprint for the Future Pepco is participating in a PHI initiative referred to as Blueprint for the Future, which is designed to meet the challenges of rising energy costs, concerns about the environment, improved reliability and government energy reduction goals. For a discussion of the Blueprint for the Future initiative, see PHIs Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Overview Blueprint for the Future. 95 PEPCO MAPP Project PJM has approved PHIs proposal to construct a new 152 mile, interstate transmission line as part of PJMs regional transmission expansion plan. In August 2011, PJM notified PHI that the scheduled in service date for MAPP has been delayed from June 1, 2015 to the 2019 to 2021 time period. Regulatory Lag An important factor in Pepcos ability to earn its authorized rate of return is the willingness of applicable public service commissions to adequately recognize forward looking costs in Pepcos rate structure in order to minimize the shortfall in revenues due to the delay in time or lag between when costs are incurred and when they are reflected in rates. This delay is commonly known as regulatory lag. Pepco is currently experiencing significant regulatory lag because its investment in the rate base and its operating expenses are outpacing revenue growth. In its most recent rate cases, Pepco (in the District of Columbia and Maryland) has proposed mechanisms that would track reliability and other expenses and permit Pepco between rate cases to make adjustments in its rates for prudent investments as made, thereby seeking to reduce the magnitude of regulatory lag. There can be no assurance that these proposals or any other attempts by Pepco to mitigate regulatory lag will be approved, or that even if approved, the rate recovery mechanisms or any base rate cases will fully ameliorate the effects of regulatory lag. Until such time as these proposed mechanisms are approved, if necessary to address the problem of regulatory lag, Pepco plans to file rate cases at least annually in an effort to align more closely its revenue and related cash flow levels with other operation and maintenance spending and capital investments. In future rate cases, Pepco would also continue to seek cost recovery and tracking mechanisms from applicable regulatory commissions to reduce the effects of regulatory lag. Results of Operations The following results of operations discussion compares the year ended December 31, 2011 to the year ended December 31, 2010. All amounts in the tables (except sales and customers) are in millions of dollars. Operating Revenue 2011 2010 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 1,111 $ 1,068 $ 43 Default Electricity Supply Revenue 933 1,185 (252 ) Other Electric Revenue 34 35 (1 ) Total Operating Revenue $ 2,078 $ 2,288 $ (210 ) The table above shows the amount of Operating Revenue earned that is subject to price regulation (Regulated T&D Electric Revenue and Default Electricity Supply Revenue) and that which is not subject to price regulation (Other Electric Revenue). Regulated T&D Electric Revenue includes revenue from the distribution of electricity, including the distribution of Default Electricity Supply, to Pepcos customers within its service territory at regulated rates. Regulated T&D Electric Revenue also includes transmission service revenue that Pepco receives as a transmission owner from PJM at rates regulated by FERC. Transmission rates are updated annually based on a FERC approved formula methodology. Default Electricity Supply Revenue is the revenue received from the supply of electricity by Pepco at regulated rates to retail customers who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier, and which is also known as SOS. The costs related to Default Electricity Supply are included in Purchased Energy. Default Electricity Supply Revenue also includes transmission enhancement credits that Pepco receives as a transmission owner from PJM for approved regional transmission expansion plan costs. Other Electric Revenue includes work and services performed on behalf of customers, including other utilities, which is generally not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of pole attachments, late payment fees and collection fees. 96 PEPCO Regulated T&D Electric 2011 2010 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue Residential $ 328 $ 314 $ 14 Commercial and industrial 647 631 16 Transmission and other 136 123 13 Total Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 1,111 $ 1,068 $ 43 2011 2010 Change Regulated T&D Electric Sales (GWh) Residential 8,052 8,350 (298 ) Commercial and industrial 18,683 19,155 (472 ) Transmission and other 160 160 Total Regulated T&D Electric Sales 26,895 27,665 (770 ) 2011 2010 Change Regulated T&D Electric Customers (in thousands) Residential 714 713 1 Commercial and industrial 74 74 Transmission and other Total Regulated T&D Electric Customers 788 787 1 Regulated T&D Electric Revenue increased by $43 million primarily due to: An increase of $13 million in transmission revenue primarily attributable to higher rates effective June 1, 2010 and June 1, 2011 related to increases in transmission plant investment. An increase of $12 million due to distribution rate increases in the District of Columbia effective March 2010 and July 2010; and in Maryland effective July 2010. An increase of $11 million due to higher pass through revenue (which is substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Other Taxes) primarily the result of rate increases in Montgomery County, Maryland utility taxes that are collected by Pepco on behalf of the county. An increase of $6 million due to customer growth in 2011, primarily in the residential class. An increase of $2 million due to the implementation of the EmPower Maryland surcharge in March 2010 (which is substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Depreciation and Amortization). Default Electricity Supply 2011 2010 Change Default Electricity Supply Revenue Residential $ 668 $ 865 $ (197 ) Commercial and industrial 257 309 (52 ) Other 8 11 (3 ) Total Default Electricity Supply Revenue $ 933 $ 1,185 $ (252 ) 2011 2010 Change Default Electricity Supply Sales (GWh) Residential 6,770 7,576 (806 ) Commercial and industrial 2,854 3,113 (259 ) Other 8 10 (2 ) Total Default Electricity Supply Sales 9,632 10,699 (1,067 ) 97 PEPCO 2011 2010 Change Default Electricity Supply Customers (in thousands) Residential 598 644 (46 ) Commercial and industrial 45 47 (2 ) Other Commercial and industrial Total Default Electricity Supply Customers 643 691 (48 ) Default Electricity Supply Revenue decreased by $252 million primarily due to: A decrease of $135 million as a result of lower Default Electricity Supply rates. A decrease of $74 million due to lower sales, primarily as a result of residential and commercial customer migration to competitive suppliers. A decrease of $48 million due to lower sales as a result of cooler weather during the spring and summer months of 2011, and warmer weather during the fall months of 2011, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2010. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $5 million due to higher non weather related average customer usage. An increase of $3 million resulting from an approval by the DCPSC of an increase in Pepcos cost recovery rate for providing Default Electricity Supply in the District of Columbia to provide for recovery of higher cash working capital costs incurred in prior periods. The higher cash working capital costs were incurred when the billing cycle for providers of Default Electricity Supply was shortened from a monthly to a weekly period, effective in June 2009. The following table shows the percentages of Pepcos total distribution sales by jurisdiction that are derived from customers receiving Default Electricity Supply from Pepco. Amounts are for the year ended December 31. 2011 2010 Sales to District of Columbia customers 27 % 29 % Sales to Maryland customers 43 % 46 % Operating Expenses Purchased Energy Purchased Energy consists of the cost of electricity purchased by Pepco to fulfill its Default Electricity Supply obligation and, as such, is recoverable from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders. Purchased Energy decreased by $259 million to $893 million in 2011 from $1,152 million in 2010 primarily due to: A decrease of $162 million due to lower average electricity costs under Default Electricity Supply contracts. A decrease of $62 million primarily due to customer migration to competitive suppliers. A decrease of $45 million due to lower electricity sales primarily as a result of cooler weather during the spring and summer months of 2011, and warmer weather during the fall months of 2011, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2010. 98 PEPCO The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $11 million in deferred electricity expense primarily due to lower Default Electricity Supply rates, which resulted in a higher rate of recovery of Default Electricity Supply costs. Other Operation and Maintenance Other Operation and Maintenance increased by $66 million to $420 million in 2011 from $354 million in 2010 primarily due to: An increase of $28 million associated with higher tree trimming and preventative maintenance costs. An increase of $13 million due to higher 2011 DCPSC rate case costs and reliability audit expenses and due to 2010 adjustments for the deferral of (i) February 2010 severe winter storm costs of $5 million and (ii) distribution rate case costs of $4 million that previously were charged to other operation and maintenance expense. The adjustments were recorded in accordance with a MPSC rate order issued in August 2010 and a DCPSC rate order issued in February 2010, allowing for the recovery of the costs. An increase of $8 million in customer support service and system support costs. An increase of $7 million primarily due to emergency restoration improvement project and reliability improvement costs. An increase of $5 million in communication costs. An increase of $4 million in employee related costs, primarily benefit expenses. An increase of $3 million in outside legal counsel fees. An increase of $3 million in emergency restoration costs. The increase is primarily related to significant incremental costs incurred for repair work following Hurricane Irene in August 2011. Costs incurred for repair work were $12 million, of which $10 million was deferred as a regulatory asset to reflect the probable recovery of these storm costs in certain jurisdictions, and the remaining $2 million was charged to other operation and maintenance expense. Pepco currently plans to seek recovery of the incremental Hurricane Irene costs in each of its jurisdictions in pending or planned distribution rate case filings. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $11 million in environmental remediation costs. Restructuring Charge As a result of PHIs organizational review in the second quarter of 2010, Pepcos operating expenses include a pre tax restructuring charge of $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, related to severance and health and welfare benefits to be provided to terminated employees. 99 PEPCO Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and Amortization expense increased by $9 million to $171 million in 2011 from $162 million in 2010 primarily due to: An increase of $5 million due to utility plant additions. An increase of $3 million in amortization of regulatory assets primarily associated with the EmPower Maryland surcharge that became effective in March 2010 (which is substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue). An increase of $1 million in the amortization of software upgrades to Pepcos Energy Management System. Other Taxes Other Taxes increased by $18 million to $382 million in 2011 from $364 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to: An increase of $16 million primarily due to rate increases in the Montgomery County, Maryland utility taxes that are collected and passed through by Pepco (substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue). An increase of $5 million due to an adjustment in the third quarter of 2010 to correct certain errors related to other taxes. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $5 million in the Energy Assistance Trust Fund surcharge primarily due to rate decreases effective October 2010 (substantially offset by a corresponding decrease in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue). Effects of Divestiture Related Claims The DCPSC on May 18, 2010 issued an order addressing all of the outstanding issues relating to Pepcos obligation to share with its District of Columbia customers the net proceeds realized by Pepco from the sale of its generation related assets in 2000. This order disallowed certain items that Pepco had included in the costs it deducted in calculating the net proceeds of the sale. The disallowance of these costs, together with interest, increased the aggregate amount Pepco is required to distribute to customers by approximately $11 million. Pepco recognized a pre tax expense of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Other Income (Expenses) Other Expenses (which are net of Other Income) decreased by $8 million to a net expense of $77 million in 2011 from a net expense of $85 million in 2010. The decrease was primarily due to: An increase of $8 million in income related to AFUDC that is applied to capital projects. An increase of $3 million in other income due to net proceeds from a company owned life insurance policy. 100 PEPCO The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $3 million in other income due to gains on the sale of four parcels of land in 2010. Income Tax Expense Pepcos effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were 26.7% and 25.5%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate primarily resulted from changes in estimates and interest related to uncertain and effectively settled tax positions offset by an increase in certain asset removal costs. Income Tax Adjustments During 2011, Pepco recorded an adjustment to correct certain income tax errors related to prior periods associated with the interest on uncertain tax positions. The adjustment resulted in an increase in income tax expense of $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. In 2010, Pepco recorded certain adjustments to correct errors in income tax expense which resulted in an increase to income tax expense of $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Capital Requirements Sources of Capital Pepco has a range of capital sources available, in addition to internally generated funds, to meet its long term and short term funding needs. The sources of long term funding include the issuance of mortgage bonds and other debt securities and bank financings, as well as the ability to issue preferred stock. Proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements, such as capital expenditures, and to repay or refinance existing indebtedness. Pepco traditionally has used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs, including commercial paper, short term notes, bank lines of credit and borrowings under the PHI money pool. Proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs, but may also be used to temporarily fund long term capital requirements. Pepcos ability to generate funds from its operations and to access the capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties. Volatile and deteriorating financial market conditions, diminished liquidity and tightening credit may affect access to certain of Pepcos potential funding sources. See Risk Factors, for additional discussion of important factors that may have an effect on Pepcos sources of capital. Debt Securities Pepco has a Mortgage and Deed of Trust (the Mortgage) under which it issues First Mortgage Bonds. First Mortgage Bonds issued under the Mortgage are secured by a lien on substantially all of Pepcos property, plant and equipment. The principal amount of First Mortgage Bonds that Pepco may issue under the Mortgage is limited by the principal amount of retired First Mortgage Bonds and 60% of the lesser of the cost or fair value of new property additions that have not been used as the basis for the issuance of additional First Mortgage Bonds. Pepco also has an Indenture under which it issues senior notes secured by First Mortgage Bonds and an Indenture under which it can issue unsecured debt securities, including medium term notes. To fund the construction of pollution control facilities, Pepco also has from time to time issued tax exempt bonds through a municipality or public agency, the proceeds of which are loaned to Pepco by the municipality or agency. 101 PEPCO Information concerning the principal amount and terms of Pepcos outstanding debt securities, as of December 31, 2011, is set forth in Note (10), Debt, to the financial statements of Pepco. Bank Financing As further discussed in Note (10), Debt, to the financial statements of Pepco, Pepco is a borrower under a $1.5 billion credit facility, along with PHI, DPL and ACE, which expires in 2016. Pepcos credit limit under the facility is the lesser of $250 million and the maximum amount of short term debt Pepco is permitted to have outstanding by its regulatory authorities. The short term borrowing limit established by FERC for Pepco is $500 million. Commercial Paper Program Pepco maintains an ongoing commercial paper program of up to $500 million under which it can issue commercial paper with maturities of up to 270 days. The commercial paper is backed by Pepcos borrowing capacity under the $1.5 billion credit facility. Pepco had $74 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011 and zero outstanding at December 31, 2010. The weighted average interest rate for commercial paper issued during 2011 was 0.35%, and the weighted average maturity was two days. Pepco did not issue commercial paper during 2010. Money Pool Pepco participates in the money pool operated by PHI under authorization received from FERC. The money pool is a cash management mechanism used by PHI and eligible subsidiaries to manage their short term investment and borrowing requirements. PHI may invest in, but not borrow from, the money pool. Eligible subsidiaries with surplus cash may deposit those funds in the money pool. Deposits in the money pool are guaranteed by PHI. Eligible subsidiaries with cash requirements may borrow from the money pool. Borrowings from the money pool are unsecured. Depositors in the money pool receive, and borrowers from the money pool pay, an interest rate based primarily on PHIs short term borrowing rate. PHI deposits funds in the money pool to the extent that the pool has insufficient funds to meet the borrowing needs of its participants, which PHI may obtain from external sources. Preferred Stock Under its Articles of Incorporation, Pepco is authorized to issue and have outstanding up to 6 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series, with each series having such rights, preferences and limitations, including dividend and voting rights and redemption provisions, as the Board of Directors may establish. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, there were no shares of Pepco preferred stock outstanding. Regulatory Restrictions on Financing Activities Pepcos long term financing activities (including the issuance of securities and the incurrence of debt) are subject to authorization by the DCPSC and MPSC. Through its periodic filings with the respective utility commissions, Pepco generally maintains standing authority sufficient to cover its projected financing needs over a multi year period. Under the FPA, FERC has jurisdiction over the issuance of long term and short term securities of public utilities, but only if the issuance is not regulated by the state public utility commission in which the public utility is organized and operating. Pepco has obtained FERC authorization for the issuance of short term debt under these provisions. 102 PEPCO Capital Expenditures Pepcos capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2011 totaled $521 million. These expenditures were primarily related to capital costs associated with new customer services, distribution reliability and transmission. The expenditures also include an allocation by PHI of hardware and software expenditures that primarily benefit Power Delivery and are allocated to Pepco when the assets are placed in service. The following table shows Pepcos projected capital expenditures for the five year period 2012 through 2016. Pepco expects to fund these expenditures through internally generated cash, external financing and capital contributions from PHI. For the Year 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Total (millions of dollars) Pepco Distribution $ 321 $ 367 $ 439 $ 398 $ 406 $ 1,931 Distribution Blueprint for the Future 76 1 77 Transmission 104 93 68 58 71 394 Transmission MAPP 1 1 1 3 132 138 Other 56 30 17 13 18 134 Sub Total 558 492 525 472 627 2,674 DOE Capital Reimbursement Awards (a) (46 ) (2 ) (48 ) Total Pepco $ 512 $ 490 $ 525 $ 472 $ 627 $ 2,626 (a) Reflects anticipated reimbursements pursuant to awards from the DOE under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. 103 PEPCO Transmission and Distribution The projected capital expenditures listed in the table above for distribution (other than Blueprint for the Future) and transmission (other than the MAPP project) are primarily for facility replacements and upgrades to accommodate customer growth and service reliability, including capital expenditures for continuing reliability enhancement efforts. Blueprint for the Future Pepco has undertaken programs to install smart meters, further automate its electric distribution systems and enhance its communications infrastructure, which it refers to as the Blueprint for the Future. For a discussion of the Blueprint for the Future initiative, see PHIs Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Overview Blueprint for the Future. The projected capital expenditures over the next five years are shown as Distribution Blueprint for the Future in the table above. MAPP Project PJM has approved PHIs proposal to construct a new 152 mile, interstate transmission line as part of PJMs regional transmission expansion plan. In August 2011, PJM notified PHI that the scheduled in service date for MAPP has been delayed from June 1, 2015 to the 2019 to 2021 time period. The projected capital expenditures over the next five years for MAPP are shown as Transmission MAPP in the table above. MAPP/DOE Loan Program To assist in the funding of the MAPP project, PHI has applied for a $684 million loan guarantee from the DOE for a substantial portion of the MAPP project, primarily the Calvert Cliffs to Indian River segment. The application has been made under a federal loan guarantee program for projects that employ innovative energy efficiency, renewable energy and advanced transmission and distribution technologies. If granted, PHI believes the guarantee could allow PHI to acquire financing at a lower cost than it would otherwise be able to obtain in the capital markets. Whether PHIs application will be granted and, if so, the amount of debt guaranteed is subject to the discretion of the DOE and the negotiation of terms that will satisfy the conditions of the guarantee program. On February 28, 2011, the DOE issued a Notice of Intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement to assist the DOE in assessing the environmental impact of constructing the portion of the MAPP project to be supported by the loan guarantee. Since February 2011, the DOE has conducted field inspections of the entire route and has held public meetings to obtain input from the communities along the route. The DOEs review of the loan guarantee program has delayed the DOEs review of PHIs loan guarantee application. There is not an approval deadline under the loan guarantee program, but this program could change or be terminated in the future. PHI continues to coordinate environmental activities with the DOE. DOE Capital Reimbursement Awards In 2009, the DOE announced a $168 million award to PHI under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for the implementation of an AMI system, direct load control, distribution automation and communications infrastructure. Pepco was awarded $149 million with $105 million to be used in the Maryland service territory and $44 million to be used in the District of Columbia service territory. In April 2010, PHI and the DOE signed agreements formalizing Pepcos $149 million share of the $168 million award. Of the $149 million, $118 million is expected to offset incurred and projected Blueprint for the Future and other capital expenditures of Pepco. The remaining $31 million will be used to offset incremental expenses associated with direct load control and other programs. In 2011, Pepco received award payments of $53 million. In 2010, Pepco received award payments of $15 million. The IRS has announced that, to the extent these grants are expended on capital items, they will not be considered taxable income. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Pepco participates in pension and OPEB plans sponsored by PHI for its employees. Pepco contributed $40 million and zero to the PHI Retirement Plan during 2011 and 2010, respectively. On January 31, 2012, Pepco made an $85 million discretionary tax deductible contribution to the PHI Retirement Plan. 104 DPL MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Delmarva Power & Light Company DPL meets the conditions set forth in General Instruction I(1)(a) and (b) to Form 10 K, and accordingly information otherwise required under this Item has been omitted in accordance with General Instruction I(2)(a) to Form 10 K. General Overview DPL is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity in Delaware and portions of Maryland. DPL also provides Default Electricity Supply, which is the supply of electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territories who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier. Default Electricity Supply is known as SOS in both Delaware and Maryland. DPLs electricity distribution service territory covers approximately 5,000 square miles and has a population of approximately 1.4 million. As of December 31, 2011, approximately 66% of delivered electricity sales were to Delaware customers and approximately 34% were to Maryland customers. In northern Delaware, DPL also supplies and distributes natural gas to retail customers and provides transportation only services to retail customers that purchase natural gas from other suppliers. DPLs natural gas distribution service territory covers approximately 275 square miles and has a population of approximately 500,000. In DPLs Delaware service territory, results historically have been seasonal, generally producing higher revenue and income in the warmest and coldest periods of the year. For retail customers of DPL in Maryland, earnings are not affected by the warmest and coldest periods of the year because a BSA for retail customers was implemented that recognizes distribution revenue based on an approved distribution charge per customer. Consequently, distribution revenue recognized is decoupled in a reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period and the only factors that will cause distribution revenue recognized in Maryland to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer. A comparable revenue decoupling mechanism for DPL electricity and natural gas customers in Delaware is under consideration by the DPSC. Changes in customer usage (such as due to weather conditions, energy prices, energy efficiency programs or other reasons) from period to period have no impact on reported distribution revenue for customers to whom the BSA applies. In accounting for the BSA in Maryland, a Revenue Decoupling Adjustment is recorded representing either (i) a positive adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from Maryland retail distribution sales falls short of the revenue that DPL is entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer or (ii) a negative adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from such distribution sales exceeds the revenue that DPL is entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer. DPL is a wholly owned subsidiary of Conectiv, which is wholly owned by PHI. Because PHI is a public utility holding company subject to PUHCA 2005, the relationship between PHI and DPL and certain activities of DPL are subject to FERCs regulatory oversight under PUHCA 2005. Blueprint for the Future DPL is participating in a PHI initiative referred to as Blueprint for the Future, which is designed to meet the challenges of rising energy costs, concerns about the environment, improved reliability and government energy reduction goals. For a discussion of the Blueprint for the Future initiative, see PHIs Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Overview Blueprint for the Future. 105 DPL MAPP Project PJM has approved PHIs proposal to construct a new 152 mile, interstate transmission line as part of PJMs regional transmission expansion plan. In August 2011, PJM notified PHI that the scheduled in service date for MAPP has been delayed from June 1, 2015 to the 2019 to 2021 time period. The projected capital expenditures over the next five years for MAPP are shown as Transmission MAPP in the table above. Regulatory Lag An important factor in the ability of DPL to earn its authorized rate of return is the willingness of applicable public service commissions to adequately recognize forward looking costs in DPLs rate structure in order to minimize the shortfall in revenues due to the delay in time or lag between when costs are incurred and when they are reflected in rates. This delay is commonly known as regulatory lag. DPL is currently experiencing significant regulatory lag because its investment in the rate base and its operating expenses are outpacing revenue growth. In its most recent rate cases, DPL (in Delaware and Maryland) has proposed mechanisms that would track reliability and other expenses and permit DPL between rate cases to make adjustments in its rates for prudent investments as made, thereby seeking to reduce the magnitude of regulatory lag. There can be no assurance that these proposals or any other attempts by DPL to mitigate regulatory lag will be approved, or that even if approved, the rate recovery mechanisms or any base rate cases will fully ameliorate the effects of regulatory lag. Until such time as these proposed mechanisms are approved, if necessary to address the problem of regulatory lag, DPL plans to file rate cases at least annually in an effort to align more closely its revenue and related cash flow levels with other operation and maintenance spending and capital investments. In future rate cases, DPL would also continue to seek cost recovery and tracking mechanisms from applicable regulatory commissions to reduce the effects of regulatory lag. 106 DPL Results of Operations The following results of operations discussion compares the year ended December 31, 2011 to the year ended December 31, 2010. All amounts in the tables (except sales and customers) are in millions of dollars. Electric Operating Revenue 2011 2010 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 394 $ 375 $ 19 Default Electricity Supply Revenue 664 768 (104 ) Other Electric Revenue 16 20 (4 ) Total Electric Operating Revenue $ 1,074 $ 1,163 $ (89 ) The table above shows the amount of Electric Operating Revenue earned that is subject to price regulation (Regulated T&D Electric Revenue and Default Electricity Supply Revenue) and that which is not subject to price regulation (Other Electric Revenue). Regulated T&D Electric Revenue includes revenue from the distribution of electricity, including the distribution of Default Electricity Supply, to DPLs customers within its service territory at regulated rates. Regulated T&D Electric Revenue also includes transmission service revenue that DPL receives as a transmission owner from PJM at rates regulated by FERC. Transmission rates are updated annually based on a FERC approved formula methodology. Default Electricity Supply Revenue is the revenue received from the supply of electricity by DPL at regulated rates to retail customers who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier, and which is also known as SOS. The costs related to Default Electricity Supply are included in Purchased Energy. Default Electricity Supply Revenue also includes transmission enhancement credits that DPL receives as a transmission owner from PJM for approved regional transmission expansion plan costs. Other Electric Revenue includes work and services performed on behalf of customers, including other utilities, which is generally not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of pole attachments, late payment fees, and collection fees. Regulated T&D Electric 2011 2010 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue Residential $ 188 $ 184 $ 4 Commercial and industrial 113 110 3 Transmission and other 93 81 12 Total Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 394 $ 375 $ 19 2011 2010 Change Regulated T&D Electric Sales (GWh) Residential 5,197 5,357 (160 ) Commercial and industrial 7,442 7,445 (3 ) Transmission and other 49 51 (2 ) Total Regulated T&D Electric Sales 12,688 12,853 (165 ) 107 DPL 2011 2010 Change Regulated T&D Electric Customers (in thousands) Residential 441 440 1 Commercial and industrial 59 59 Transmission and other 1 1 Total Regulated T&D Electric Customers 501 500 1 Regulated T&D Electric Revenue increased by $19 million primarily due to: An increase of $12 million in transmission revenue primarily attributable to higher rates effective June 1, 2010 and June 1, 2011 related to increases in transmission plant investment. An increase of $11 million due to distribution rate increases in Maryland effective July 2011, and in Delaware effective February 2011. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $4 million due to lower sales as a result of cooler weather during the 2011 spring and summer months, and warmer weather during the 2011 fall months as compared to 2010. Default Electricity Supply 2011 2010 Change Default Electricity Supply Revenue Residential $ 505 $ 577 $ (72 ) Commercial and industrial 148 181 (33 ) Other 11 10 1 Total Default Electricity Supply Revenue $ 664 $ 768 $ (104 ) 2011 2010 Change Default Electricity Supply Sales (GWh) Residential 4,856 5,199 (343 ) Commercial and industrial 1,845 1,954 (109 ) Other 29 37 (8 ) Total Default Electricity Supply Sales 6,730 7,190 (460 ) 2011 2010 Change Default Electricity Supply Customers (in thousands) Residential 415 423 (8 ) Commercial and industrial 42 45 (3 ) Other 1 (1 ) Total Default Electricity Supply Customers 457 469 (12 ) Default Supply Revenue decreased by $104 million primarily due to: A decrease of $58 million as a result of lower Default Electricity Supply rates. A decrease of $28 million due to lower sales, primarily as a result of customer migration to competitive suppliers. 108 DPL A decrease of $25 million due to lower sales as a result of cooler weather during the spring and summer months of 2011, and warmer weather during the fall months of 2011, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2010. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $7 million due to higher non weather related average customer usage. The following table shows the percentages of DPLs total distribution sales by jurisdiction that are derived from customers receiving Default Electricity Supply from DPL. Amounts are for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 Sales to Delaware customers 51 % 53 % Sales to Maryland customers 58 % 63 % Natural Gas Operating Revenue 2011 2010 Change Regulated Gas Revenue $ 183 $ 191 $ (8 ) Other Gas Revenue 47 46 1 Total Natural Gas Operating Revenue $ 230 $ 237 $ (7 ) The table above shows the amounts of Natural Gas Operating Revenue from sources that are subject to price regulation (Regulated Gas Revenue) and those that generally are not subject to price regulation (Other Gas Revenue). Regulated Gas Revenue includes the revenue DPL receives from on system natural gas delivered sales and the transportation of natural gas for customers within its service territory at regulated rates. Other Gas Revenue includes off system natural gas sales and the short term release of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity not needed to serve customers. Off system sales are made possible when low demand for natural gas by regulated customers creates excess pipeline capacity. Regulated Gas 2011 2010 Change Regulated Gas Revenue Residential $ 113 $ 118 $ (5 ) Commercial and industrial 61 65 (4 ) Transportation and other 9 8 1 Total Regulated Gas Revenue $ 183 $ 191 $ (8 ) 2011 2010 Change Regulated Gas Sales (billion cubic feet) Residential 7 8 (1 ) Commercial and industrial 5 5 Transportation and other 7 6 1 Total Regulated Gas Sales 19 19 2011 2010 Change Regulated Gas Customers (in thousands) Residential 115 114 1 Commercial and industrial 9 9 Transportation and other Total Regulated Gas Customers 124 123 1 109 DPL Regulated Gas Revenue decreased by $8 million primarily due to: A decrease of $17 million due to lower non weather related average customer usage. The decrease was partially offset by: An increase of $6 million due to higher sales primarily as a result of colder weather during the winter months of 2011 as compared to 2010. An increase of $2 million due to a distribution rate increase effective February 2011. An increase of $2 million due to customer growth in 2011. Operating Expenses Purchased Energy Purchased Energy consists of the cost of electricity purchased by DPL to fulfill its Default Electricity Supply obligation and, as such, is recoverable from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders. Purchased Energy decreased by $105 million to $635 million in 2011, from $740 million in 2010 primarily due to: A decrease of $68 million due to lower average electricity costs under Default Electricity Supply contracts. A decrease of $22 million due to lower electricity sales primarily as a result of cooler weather during the spring and summer months of 2011, and warmer weather during the fall months of 2011, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2010. A decrease of $21 million primarily due to customer migration to competitive suppliers. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $8 million in deferred electricity expense primarily due to lower Default Electricity Supply rates, which resulted in a higher rate of recovery of Default Electricity Supply costs. Gas Purchased Gas Purchased consists of the cost of gas purchased by DPL to fulfill its obligation to regulated gas customers and, as such, is recoverable from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders. It also includes the cost of gas purchased for off system sales. Total Gas Purchased decreased by $9 million to $155 million in 2011 from $164 million in 2010 primarily due to: A decrease of $16 million in the cost of gas purchases for on system sales as a result of lower average gas prices, lower volumes purchased and lower withdraws from storage. A decrease of $11 million from the settlement of financial hedges entered into as part of DPLs hedge program for the purchase of regulated natural gas. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $18 million in deferred gas expense as a result of a higher rate of recovery of natural gas supply costs. 110 DPL Other Operation and Maintenance Other Operation and Maintenance decreased by $16 million to $239 million in 2011 from $255 million in 2010 primarily due to: A decrease of $16 million resulting from adjustments recorded by DPL in 2011 associated with the accounting for DPL Default Electricity Supply. These adjustments were primarily due to the under recognition of allowed returns on working capital, uncollectible, late fees and administrative costs. A decrease of $4 million in environmental remediation costs. A decrease of $2 million due to an adjustment of self insurance reserves for general and auto liability claims recorded in 2011. A decrease of $2 million due to an adjustment for February 2010 severe winter storm costs that previously were charged to other operation and maintenance expense. The adjustment was recorded in accordance with a MPSC rate order issued in July 2011, allowing for the recovery of the costs. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $5 million in emergency restoration costs. The increase is primarily related to significant incremental costs incurred for repair work following Hurricane Irene in August 2011. Costs incurred for repair work were $8 million, of which $5 million was deferred as a regulatory asset to reflect the probable recovery of these storm costs in certain jurisdictions, and the remaining $3 million was charged to other operation and maintenance expense. DPL currently plans to seek recovery of the incremental Hurricane Irene costs in each of its jurisdictions in planned distribution rate case filings. An increase of $5 million associated with higher preventative maintenance and tree trimming costs. Restructuring Charge As a result of PHIs organizational review in the second quarter of 2010, DPLs operating expenses include a pre tax restructuring charge of $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, related to severance and health and welfare benefits to be provided to terminated employees. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and Amortization expense increased by $6 million to $89 million in 2011 from $83 million in 2010 primarily due to: An increase of $4 million due to utility plant additions. An increase of $1 million in amortization of regulatory assets primarily associated with the EmPower Maryland surcharge that became effective in March 2010 (which is substantially offset by a corresponding increase in Regulated T&D Electric Revenue). 111 DPL Income Tax Expense DPLs effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were 37.2% and 40.8%, respectively. The decrease in the effective rate is primarily related to PHIs 2011 settlement with the IRS regarding interest due on its federal tax liabilities related to the November 2010 audit settlement for the tax years 1996 to 2002. In connection with this agreement, PHI reallocated certain amounts that have been on deposit with the IRS since 2006 among liabilities in the settlement years and subsequent years. Primarily related to the settlement and reallocations, DPL recorded an additional $4 million (after tax) interest benefit. This is partially offset by adjustments recorded in the third quarter of 2011 related to DPLs settlement with the state taxing authorities resulting in $1 million (after tax) of additional tax expense and the recalculation of interest on its uncertain tax positions for open tax years based on different assumptions related to the application of its deposit made with the IRS in 2006. This resulted in an additional tax expense of $1 million (after tax). In addition, the effective tax rate increased in 2010 as a result of the November 2010 settlement PHI reached with the IRS with respect to its Federal tax returns for the years 1996 to 2002. In connection with the settlement, PHI reallocated certain amounts on deposit with the IRS since 2006 among liabilities in the settlement years and subsequent years. In light of the settlement and reallocations, DPL recalculated the estimated interest due for the tax years 1996 to 2002. The revised estimate resulted in an additional $3 million (after tax) of estimated interest due to the IRS. This expense was partially offset by the reversal of $2 million of previously recorded tax liabilities. Capital Requirements Sources of Capital DPL has a range of capital sources available, in addition to internally generated funds, to meet its long term and short term funding needs. The sources of long term funding include the issuance of mortgage bonds and other debt securities and bank financings, as well as the ability to issue preferred stock. Proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements, such as capital expenditures, and to repay or refinance existing indebtedness. DPL traditionally has used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs, including commercial paper, short term notes, bank lines of credit, and borrowings under the PHI money pool. Proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs, but may also be used to temporarily fund long term capital requirements. DPLs ability to generate funds from its operations and to access the capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties. Volatile and deteriorating financial market conditions, diminished liquidity and tightening credit may affect access to certain of DPLs potential funding sources. See Risk Factors, for additional discussion of important factors that may have an effect on DPLs sources of capital. Debt Securities DPL has a Mortgage and Deed of Trust (the Mortgage) under which it issues First Mortgage Bonds. First Mortgage Bonds issued under the Mortgage are secured by a lien on substantially all of DPLs property, plant and equipment. The principal amount of First Mortgage Bonds that DPL may issue under the Mortgage is limited by the principal amount of retired First Mortgage Bonds and 60% of the lesser of the cost or fair value of new property additions that have not been used as the basis for the issuance of additional First Mortgage Bonds. DPL also has an Indenture under which it issues unsecured senior notes, medium term notes and VRDBs. To fund the construction of pollution control facilities, DPL also has from time to time issued tax exempt bonds, including tax exempt VRDBs, through a public agency, the proceeds of which are loaned to DPL by the agency. 112 DPL Information concerning the principal amount and terms of DPLs outstanding First Mortgage Bonds, senior notes, medium term notes and VRDBs, and tax exempt bonds issued for the benefit of DPL, as of December 31, 2011, is set forth in Note (11), Debt, to the financial statements of DPL. Bank Financing As further discussed in Note (11), Debt, to the financial statements of DPL, DPL is a borrower under a $1.5 billion credit facility, along with PHI, Pepco and ACE, which expires in 2016. DPLs credit limit under the facility is the lesser of $250 million and the maximum amount of short term debt DPL is permitted to have outstanding by its regulatory authorities. The short term borrowing limit established by FERC for DPL is $500 million. Commercial Paper Program DPL maintains an ongoing commercial paper program of up to $500 million under which it can issue commercial paper with maturities of up to 270 days. The commercial paper is backed by DPLs borrowing capacity under the $1.5 billion credit facility. DPL had $47 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011 and zero outstanding at December 31, 2010. The weighted average interest rates for commercial paper issued during 2011 and 2010 were 0.34%. The weighted average maturity of all commercial paper issued by DPL during 2011 and 2010 was two days. Money Pool DPL participates in the money pool operated by PHI under authorization received from FERC. The money pool is a cash management mechanism used by PHI and eligible subsidiaries to manage their short term investment and borrowing requirements. PHI may invest in, but not borrow from, the money pool. Eligible subsidiaries with surplus cash may deposit those funds in the money pool. Deposits in the money pool are guaranteed by PHI. Eligible subsidiaries with cash requirements may borrow from the money pool. Borrowings from the money pool are unsecured. Depositors in the money pool receive, and borrowers from the money pool pay, an interest rate based primarily on PHIs short term borrowing rate. PHI deposits funds in the money pool to the extent that the pool has insufficient funds to meet the borrowing needs of its participants, which PHI may obtain from external sources. Regulatory Restrictions on Financing Activities DPLs long term financing activities (including the issuance of securities and the incurrence of debt) is subject to authorization by the DPSC and the MPSC. Through its periodic filings with the respective utility commissions, DPL generally maintains standing authority sufficient to cover its projected financing needs over a multi year period. Under the FPA, FERC has jurisdiction over the issuance of long term and short term securities of public utilities, but only if the issuance is not regulated by the state public utility commission in which the public utility is organized and operating. DPL has obtained FERC authorization for the issuance of short term debt under these provisions. Capital Expenditures DPLs capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2011, totaled $229 million. These expenditures were primarily related to capital costs associated with new customer services, distribution reliability and transmission. The expenditures also include an allocation by PHI of hardware and software expenditures that primarily benefit Power Delivery and are allocated to DPL when the assets are placed in service. 113 DPL The following table shows DPLs projected capital expenditures for the five year period 2012 through 2016. DPL expects to fund these expenditures through internally generated cash, external financing and capital contributions from PHI. For the Year 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Total (millions of dollars) DPL Distribution $ 136 $ 153 $ 144 $ 144 $ 161 $ 738 Distribution Blueprint for the Future 44 2 46 Transmission 148 93 128 120 116 605 Transmission MAPP 4 1 1 3 58 67 Gas Delivery 22 23 23 25 27 120 Other 52 29 20 14 17 132 Total DPL $ 406 $ 301 $ 316 $ 306 $ 379 $ 1,708 Transmission and Distribution The projected capital expenditures listed in the table above for distribution (other than Blueprint for the Future), transmission (other than the MAPP project) and gas delivery are primarily for facility replacements and upgrades to accommodate customer growth and service reliability, including capital expenditures for reliability enhancement efforts. Blueprint for the Future DPL has undertaken programs to install smart meters, further automate its electric distribution systems and enhance its communications infrastructure, which it refers to as the Blueprint for the Future. For a discussion of the Blueprint for the Future initiative, see PHIs Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Overview Blueprint for the Future. The projected capital expenditures over the next five years are shown as Distribution Blueprint for the Future in the table above. MAPP Project PHI has under development the construction of a new 152 mile, interstate transmission line as part of PJMs regional transmission expansion plan. The projected capital expenditures over the next five years for MAPP are shown as Transmission MAPP in the table above. MAPP/DOE Loan Program To assist in the funding of the MAPP project, PHI has applied for a $684 million loan guarantee from the DOE for a substantial portion of the MAPP project, primarily the Calvert Cliffs to Indian River segment. The application has been made under a federal loan guarantee program for projects that employ innovative energy efficiency, renewable energy and advanced transmission and distribution technologies. If granted, PHI believes the guarantee could allow PHI to acquire financing at a lower cost than it would otherwise be able to obtain in the capital markets. Whether PHIs application will be granted and, if so, the amount of debt guaranteed is subject to the discretion of the DOE and the negotiation of terms that will satisfy the conditions of the guarantee program. On February 28, 2011, 114 DPL the DOE issued a Notice of Intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement to assist the DOE in assessing the environmental impact of constructing the portion of the MAPP project to be supported by the loan guarantee. Since February 2011, the DOE has conducted field inspections of the entire route and has held public meetings to obtain input from the communities along the route. The DOEs review of the loan guarantee program has delayed the DOEs review of PHIs loan guarantee application. There is not an approval deadline under the loan guarantee program, but this program could change or be terminated in the future. PHI continues to coordinate environmental activities with the DOE. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans DPL participates in pension and OPEB plans sponsored by PHI for its employees. DPL contributed $40 million and zero to the PHI Retirement Plan during 2011 and 2010, respectively. On January 31, 2012, DPL made an $85 million discretionary tax deductible contribution to the PHI Retirement Plan. 115 ACE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Atlantic City Electric Company ACE meets the conditions set forth in General Instruction I(1)(a) and (b) to Form 10 K, and accordingly information otherwise required under this Item has been omitted in accordance with General Instruction I(2)(a) to Form 10 K. General Overview ACE is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity in southern New Jersey. ACE also provides Default Electricity Supply, which is the supply of electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territory who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier. Default Electricity Supply is known as BGS in New Jersey. ACEs service territory covers approximately 2,700 square miles and has a population of approximately 1.1 million. ACE is a wholly owned subsidiary of Conectiv, which is wholly owned by PHI. Because PHI is a public utility holding company subject to PUHCA 2005, the relationship between PHI and ACE and certain activities of ACE are subject to FERCs regulatory oversight under PUHCA 2005. Blueprint for the Future ACE is participating in a PHI initiative referred to as Blueprint for the Future, which is designed to meet the challenges of rising energy costs, concerns about the environment, improved reliability and government energy reduction goals. For a discussion of the Blueprint for the Future initiative, see PHIs Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Overview Blueprint for the Future. Regulatory Lag An important factor in ACEs ability to earn its authorized rate of return is the willingness of the NJBPU to adequately recognize forward looking costs in ACEs rate structure in order to minimize the shortfall in revenues due to the delay in time or lag between when costs are incurred and when they are reflected in rates. This delay is commonly known as regulatory lag. ACE is currently experiencing significant regulatory lag because its investment in the rate base and its operating expenses are outpacing revenue growth. The NJBPU has approved certain rate recovery mechanisms in connection with ACEs Infrastructure Investment Program (IIP), which ACE has proposed to extend and expand. There can be no assurance that this proposal or any other attempts by ACE to mitigate regulatory lag will be approved, or that even if approved, the rate recovery mechanisms or any base rate cases will fully ameliorate the effects of regulatory lag. Until such time as this proposed mechanism is approved, if necessary to address the problem of regulatory lag, ACE plans to file rate cases at least annually in an effort to align more closely its revenue and related cash flow levels with other operation and maintenance spending and capital investments. In future rate cases, ACE would also continue to seek cost recovery and tracking mechanisms from applicable regulatory commissions to reduce the effects of regulatory lag. 116 ACE Results of Operations The following results of operations discussion compares the year ended December 31, 2011 to the year ended December 31, 2010. All amounts in the tables (except sales and customers) are in millions of dollars. Operating Revenue 2011 2010 Change Regulated T&D Electric Revenue $ 386 $ 415 $ (29 ) Default Electricity Supply Revenue 865 998 (133 ) Other Electric Revenue 17 17 Total Operating Revenue $ 1,268 $ 1,430 $ (162 ) The table above shows the amount of Operating Revenue earned that is subject to price regulation (Regulated T&D Electric Revenue and Default Electricity Supply Revenue) and that which is not subject to price regulation (Other Electric Revenue). Regulated T&D Electric Revenue includes revenue from the distribution of electricity, including the distribution of Default Electricity Supply, to ACEs customers within its service territory at regulated rates. Regulated T&D Electric Revenue also includes transmission service revenue that ACE receives as a transmission owner from PJM at rates regulated by FERC. Transmission rates are updated annually based on a FERC approved formula methodology. Default Electricity Supply Revenue is the revenue received from the supply of electricity by ACE at regulated rates to retail customers who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive supplier, also known as BGS. The costs related to Default Electricity Supply are included in Purchased Energy. Default Electricity Supply Revenue also includes revenue from Transition Bond Charges that ACE receives, and pays to ACE Funding, to fund the principal and interest payments on Transition Bonds issued by ACE Funding, and revenue in the form of transmission enhancement credits. Other Electric Revenue includes work and services performed on behalf of customers, including other utilities, which is generally not subject to price regulation. Work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities, highway relocation, rentals of pole attachments, late payment fees, and collection fees.

A decrease of $8 million due to lower non weather related average customer usage. A decrease of $7 million due to lower sales as a result of cooler weather during the spring and summer months of 2011, and warmer weather during the fall months of 2011, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2010. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $9 million due to a distribution rate increase that became effective in June 2010. An increase of $7 million in transmission revenue primarily attributable to higher rates effective June 1, 2010 and June 1, 2011 related to increases in transmission plant investment.

A decrease of $40 million in wholesale energy and capacity resale revenues primarily due to the sale of lower volumes of electricity and capacity purchased from NUGs. A decrease of $21 million due to lower sales as a result of cooler weather during the spring and summer months of 2011, and warmer weather during the fall months of 2011, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2010. A decrease of $11 million due to lower non weather related average customer usage. A decrease of $3 million due to a decrease in revenue from transmission enhancement credits. The aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by: An increase of $39 million as a result of higher Default Electricity Supply rates, primarily due to a Non utility Generation Charge rate increase that became effective in January 2011. Total Default Electricity Supply Revenue for the 2011 period includes a decrease of $8 million in unbilled revenue attributable to ACEs BGS ($5 million decrease in net income), primarily due to lower customer usage and lower Default Electricity Supply rates during the unbilled revenue period at the end of 2011 as compared to the corresponding period in 2010. Under the BGS terms approved by the NJBPU, ACEs BGS unbilled revenue is not included in the deferral calculation until it is billed to customers, and therefore has an impact on the results of operations in the period during which it is accrued. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the percentages of ACEs total distribution sales that are derived from customers receiving Default Electricity Supply are 56% and 65%, respectively. Operating Expenses Purchased Energy Purchased Energy consists of the cost of electricity purchased by ACE to fulfill its Default Electricity Supply obligation and, as such, is recoverable from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders. Purchased Energy decreased by $223 million to $807 million in 2011 from $1,030 million in 2010 primarily due to: A decrease of $138 million primarily due to customer migration to competitive suppliers. A decrease of $69 million due to lower average electricity costs under Default Electricity Supply contracts. 119 ACE A decrease of $16 million due to lower electricity sales primarily as a result of cooler weather during the spring and summer months of 2011, and warmer weather during the fall months of 2011, as compared to 2010. Other Operation and Maintenance Other Operation and Maintenance increased by $22 million to $226 million in 2011 from $204 million in 2010 primarily due to: An increase of $5 million associated with higher tree trimming and preventative maintenance costs. An increase of $5 million related to New Jersey Societal Benefit Program costs that are deferred and recoverable. An increase of $4 million in employee related costs, primarily benefit expenses. An increase of $3 million in corporate cost allocations. An increase of $2 million in costs related to customer requested and mutual assistance work (primarily offset in other T&D Electric Revenues). An increase of $2 million in emergency restoration and reliability improvement, communication and customer support service costs. The aggregate amount of these increases was partially offset by: A decrease of $4 million in emergency restoration costs due to higher storm activity in 2010, primarily the severe winter storms of February 2010. In 2011, ACE incurred significant incremental restoration costs for repair work following Hurricane Irene in August 2011 of $7 million, but such costs were deferred as a regulatory asset to reflect the probable recovery of these storm costs. Approximately $3 million of these total incremental storm costs have been estimated for the cost of restoration services provided by outside contractors. Since the invoices for such services had not been received at December 31, 2011, actual invoices may vary from these estimates. ACE currently plans to seek recovery of the incremental Hurricane Irene costs as discussed in Note (7), Regulatory Matters Regulatory Proceedings Rate Proceedings. Restructuring Charge As a result of PHIs organizational review in the second quarter of 2010, ACEs operating expenses include a pre tax restructuring charge of $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, related to severance and health and welfare benefits to be provided to terminated employees. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and Amortization expense increased by $22 million to $134 million in 2011 from $112 million in 2010 primarily due to: An increase of $16 million in amortization of stranded costs as the result of higher revenue due to rate increases effective October 2010 for the ACE Transition Bond Charge and Market Transition Charge Tax (partially offset in Default Electricity Supply Revenue). An increase of $6 million due to utility plant additions. 120 ACE Deferred Electric Service Costs Deferred Electric Service Costs represent (i) the over or under recovery of electricity costs incurred by ACE to fulfill its Default Electricity Supply obligation and (ii) the over or under recovery of New Jersey Societal Benefit Program costs incurred by ACE. The cost of electricity purchased is reported under Purchased Energy and the corresponding revenue is reported under Default Electricity Supply Revenue. The cost of New Jersey Societal Benefit Programs is reported under Other Operation and Maintenance and the corresponding revenue is reported under Regulated T&D Electric Revenue. Deferred Electric Service Costs increased by $45 million, to an expense reduction of $63 million in 2011 as compared to an expense reduction of $108 million in 2010, primarily due to higher Default Electricity Supply Revenue rates and lower electricity supply costs. Income Tax Expense ACEs consolidated effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were 45.8% and 44.8%, respectively. The increase in the rate is primarily the result of the recalculation of interest on uncertain and effectively settled tax positions. During 2011, PHI reached a settlement with the IRS with respect to interest due on its federal tax liabilities related to the November 2010 audit settlement for years 1996 through 2002. In connection with this agreement, PHI reallocated certain amounts that have been on deposit with the IRS since 2006 among liabilities in the settlement years and subsequent years. Primarily related to the settlement and reallocations, ACE has recorded an additional $1 million (after tax) of interest due to the IRS. This additional interest expense was recorded in the second quarter of 2011. This is further impacted by the adjustment recorded in the third quarter of 2011 related to the recalculation of interest on its uncertain tax positions for open tax years using different assumptions related to the application of its deposit made with the IRS in 2006. This resulted in an additional tax expense of $3 million (after tax). Capital Requirements Sources of Capital ACE has a range of capital sources available, in addition to internally generated funds, to meet its long term and short term funding needs. The sources of long term funding include the issuance of mortgage bonds and other debt securities and bank financings, as well as preferred stock. Proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements, such as capital expenditures, and to repay or refinance existing indebtedness. ACE traditionally has used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs, including commercial paper, short term notes, bank lines of credit, and under certain circumstances, borrowings under the PHI money pool. Proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs, but may also be used to temporarily fund long term capital requirements. ACEs ability to generate funds from its operations and to access the capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties. Volatile and deteriorating financial market conditions, diminished liquidity and tightening credit may affect access to certain of ACEs potential funding sources. See Risk Factors, for additional discussion of important factors that may have an effect on ACEs sources of capital. Debt Securities ACE has a Mortgage and Deed of Trust (the Mortgage) under which it issues First Mortgage Bonds. First Mortgage Bonds issued under the Mortgage are secured by a lien on substantially all of ACEs property, plant and equipment. The principal amount of First Mortgage Bonds that ACE may issue under the Mortgage is limited by the principal amount of retired First Mortgage Bonds and 65% of the lesser of the cost or fair value of new property additions that have not been used as the basis for the issuance of additional First Mortgage Bonds. ACE also has an Indenture under which it issues senior notes secured by First Mortgage Bonds and an Indenture under which it can issue unsecured debt securities, including VRDBs. To fund the construction of pollution control facilities, ACE also has from time to time issued tax exempt bonds, including tax exempt VRDBs, through a municipality, the proceeds of which are loaned to ACE by the municipality. 121 ACE Information concerning the principal amount and terms of ACEs outstanding First Mortgage Bonds, senior notes and VRDBs, and tax exempt bonds issued for the benefit of ACE, as of December 31, 2011, is set forth in Note (10), Debt, to the consolidated financial statements of ACE. Bank Financing As further discussed in Note (10), Debt, to the consolidated financial statements of ACE, ACE is a borrower under a $1.5 billion credit facility, along with PHI, Pepco and DPL, which expires in 2016. ACEs credit limit under the facility is the lesser of $250 million and the maximum amount of short term debt ACE is permitted to have outstanding by its regulatory authorities. The short term borrowing limit established by the NJBPU for ACE is $250 million. Commercial Paper Program ACE maintains an ongoing commercial paper program of up to $250 million under which it can issue commercial paper with maturities of up to 270 days. The commercial paper is backed by ACEs borrowing capacity under the $1.5 billion credit facility. ACE had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011 and $158 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2010. The weighted average interest rates for commercial paper issued during 2011 and 2010 were 0.33% and 0.36%, respectively. The weighted average maturity of all commercial paper issued by ACE during 2011 and 2010 was six days and seven days, respectively. Money Pool ACE participates in the money pool operated by PHI under authorization received from the NJBPU. The money pool is a cash management mechanism used by PHI and eligible subsidiaries to manage their short term investment and borrowing requirements. PHI may invest in, but not borrow from, the money pool. Eligible subsidiaries with surplus cash may deposit those funds in the money pool. Deposits in the money pool are guaranteed by PHI. Eligible subsidiaries with cash requirements may borrow from the money pool. Borrowings from the money pool are unsecured. Depositors in the money pool receive, and borrowers from the money pool pay, an interest rate based primarily on PHIs short term borrowing rate. PHI deposits funds in the money pool to the extent that the pool has insufficient funds to meet the borrowing needs of its participants, which PHI may obtain from external sources. By regulatory order, the NJBPU has restricted ACEs participation in the PHI money pool. ACE may not invest in the money pool, but may borrow from it if the rates are lower than the rates at which ACE could borrow funds externally. Preferred Stock Under its Certificate of Incorporation, ACE is authorized to issue and have outstanding up to (i) 799,979 shares of Cumulative Preferred Stock, (ii) 2 million shares of No Par Preferred Stock and (iii) 3 million shares of Preference Stock, each such type of preferred stock having such terms and conditions as are set forth in or authorized by the Certificate of Incorporation. Information concerning the numbers of shares and the terms of ACEs outstanding shares of Cumulative Preferred Stock as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, is set forth in Note (12), Preferred Stock, to the consolidated financial statements of ACE. As of December 31, 2011, ACE had no shares of preferred stock outstanding. 122 ACE Regulatory Restrictions on Financing Activities ACEs long term and short term (consisting of debt instruments with a maturity of one year or less) financing activities are subject to authorization by the NJBPU. Through its periodic filings with the NJBPU, ACE generally maintains standing authority sufficient to cover its projected financing needs over a multi year period. ACEs long term and short term financing activities do not require FERC approval. State corporate laws impose limitations on the funds that can be used to pay dividends. In addition, ACE must obtain the approval of the NJBPU before dividends can be paid if its equity as a percent of its total capitalization, excluding securitization debt, falls below 30%. As of December 31, 2011, ACE complied with this requirement without the need to seek approval of the NJBPU. Capital Expenditures ACEs capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2011, totaled $138 million. These expenditures were primarily related to capital costs associated with new customer services, distribution reliability and transmission. The expenditures also include an allocation by PHI of hardware and software expenditures that primarily benefit Power Delivery and are allocated to ACE when the assets are placed in service. The following table shows ACEs updated projected capital expenditures for the five year period 2012 through 2016. ACE expects to fund these expenditures through internally generated cash, external financing and capital contributions from PHI. For the Year 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Total (millions of dollars) ACE Distribution $ 144 $ 159 $ 146 $ 147 $ 144 $ 740 Distribution Blueprint for the Future 9 92 101 Transmission 53 74 82 77 71 357 Other 32 21 13 12 14 92 Sub Total 229 254 241 245 321 1,290 DOE Capital Reimbursement Awards (a) (4 ) (1 ) (5 ) Total ACE $ 225 $ 253 $ 241 $ 245 $ 321 $ 1,285 (a) Reflects anticipated reimbursements pursuant to awards from the DOE under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. 123 ACE The IRS has announced that, to the extent these grants are expended on capital items, they will not be considered taxable income. Transmission and Distribution The projected capital expenditures listed in the table for distribution (other than Blueprint for the Future) and transmission are primarily for facility replacements and upgrades to accommodate customer growth and reliability, including continued capital expenditures for reliability enhancement efforts. Blueprint for the Future ACE has undertaken programs to install smart meters (for which approval by the NJBPU has been deferred), further automate its electric distribution systems and enhance its communications infrastructure, which it refers to as the Blueprint for the Future. For a discussion of the Blueprint for the Future initiative, see PHIs Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Overview Blueprint for the Future. The projected capital expenditures over the next five years are shown as Distribution Blueprint for the Future in the table above. Infrastructure Investment Plan In 2009, the NJBPU approved ACEs proposed Infrastructure Investment Plan and the revenue requirement associated with recovering the cost of the related projects, subject to a prudency review in the next rate case. The approved projects were designed to enhance reliability of ACEs distribution system and support economic activity and job growth in New Jersey in the near term. ACE was granted cost recovery through an Infrastructure Investment Surcharge, which became effective on June 1, 2009. This approved plan was completed in 2011 and has added incremental capital spending of approximately $28 million since 2009. In 2011, ACE proposed a new Infrastructure Investment Plan that if approved by the NJBPU, would be expected to add an additional $63 million of capital spending for 2012, which is included in Distribution in the table above. DOE Capital Reimbursement Awards In 2009, the DOE announced a $168 million award to PHI under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for the implementation of an advanced metering infrastructure system, direct load control, distribution automation, and communications infrastructure, of which $19 million was for ACEs service territory. In April 2010, PHI and the DOE signed agreements formalizing ACEs $19 million share of the $168 million award. Of the $19 million, $12 million is expected to offset incurred and projected Blueprint for the Future and other capital expenditures of ACE. The remaining $7 million will be used to offset incremental expenses associated with direct load control and other programs. In 2011, ACE received award payments of $6 million. In 2010, ACE received award payments of $2 million. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans ACE participates in pension and OPEB plans sponsored by PHI for its employees. ACE contributed $30 million and zero to the PHI Retirement Plan during 2011 and 2010, respectively. On January 31, 2012, ACE made a $30 million discretionary tax deductible contribution to the PHI Retirement Plan. 124 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Risk management policies for PHI and its subsidiaries are determined by PHIs Corporate Risk Management Committee (CRMC), the members of which are PHIs Chief Risk Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Chief Information Officer and other senior executives. The CRMC monitors interest rate fluctuation, commodity price fluctuation, and credit risk exposure, and sets risk management policies that establish limits on unhedged risk and determine risk reporting requirements. For information about PHIs derivative activities, other than the information otherwise disclosed herein, refer to Note (2), Significant Accounting Policies Accounting For Derivatives, Note (15), Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and Note (20), Discontinued Operations of the consolidated financial statements of PHI. Pepco Holdings, Inc. Commodity Price Risk The Pepco Energy Services segment engages in commodity risk management activities to reduce its financial exposure to changes in the value of its assets and obligations due to commodity price fluctuations. Certain of these risk management activities are conducted using instruments classified as derivatives based on FASB guidance on derivatives and hedging, ASC 815. Pepco Energy Services also manages commodity risk with contracts that are not classified as derivatives. The primary risk management objective is to manage the spread between retail electricity and natural gas supply commitments and the cost of energy used to service those commitments in order to ensure stable and known cash flows and fix favorable prices and margins. PHIs risk management policies place oversight at the senior management level through the CRMC, which has the responsibility for establishing corporate compliance requirements for energy market participation. PHI collectively refers to these energy market activities, including its commodity risk management activities, as energy commodity activities. PHI uses a value at risk (VaR) model to assess the market risk of the energy commodity activities of Pepco Energy Services. PHI also uses other measures to limit and monitor risk in its energy commodity activities, including limits on the nominal size of positions and periodic loss limits. VaR represents the potential fair value loss on energy contracts or portfolios due to changes in market prices for a specified time period and confidence level. PHI uses a delta gamma VaR estimation model. The other parameters include a 95 percent, one tailed confidence level and a one day holding period. Since VaR is an estimate, it is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur. The table below provides the VaR associated with energy contracts of the Pepco Energy Services segment for the year ended December 31, 2011 in millions of dollars: VaR (a) 95% confidence level, one day holding period, one tailed Period end $ 1 Average for the period $ 1 High $ 3 Low $ 1 (a) This column represents all energy derivative contracts, normal purchase and normal sales contracts, modeled generation output and fuel requirements, and modeled customer load obligations for Pepco Energy Services energy commodity activities. 125 Pepco Energy Services purchases electric and natural gas futures, swaps, options and forward contracts to hedge price risk in connection with the purchase of physical natural gas and electricity for distribution to customers. Pepco Energy Services accounts for its derivatives as either cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions or they are marked to market through current earnings. Forward contracts that meet the requirements for normal purchase and normal sale accounting under FASB guidance on derivatives and hedging are recorded on an accrual basis. Credit and Nonperformance Risk Pepco Holdings subsidiaries attempt to minimize credit risk exposure to wholesale energy counterparties through, among other things, formal credit policies, regular assessment of counterparty creditworthiness and the establishment of a credit limit for each counterparty, monitoring procedures that include stress testing, the use of standard agreements which allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty and collateral requirements under certain circumstances, and have established reserves for credit losses. As of December 31, 2011, credit exposure to wholesale energy counterparties was weighted 100% with investment grade counterparties. There were no investments with counterparties without external credit quality ratings and no investments with non investment grade counterparties. The following table provides information on the credit exposure on competitive wholesale energy contracts, net of collateral, to wholesale counterparties as of December 31, 2011, in millions of dollars: Rating Exposure BeforeCreditCollateral (b) CreditCollateral (c) NetExposure Number ofCounterpartiesGreater Than10% (d) Net Exposure ofCounterpartiesGreaterThan 10% Investment Grade (a) $ 4 $ $ 4 2 $ 4 Non Investment Grade No External Ratings Credit reserves (a) Investment Grade primarily determined using publicly available credit ratings of the counterparty. If the counterparty has provided a guarantee by a higher rated entity (e.g., its parent), it is determined based upon the rating of its guarantor. Included in Investment Grade are counterparties with a minimum Standard & Poors or Moodys Investor Service rating of BBB or Baa3, respectively. (b) Exposure before credit collateral includes the marked to market energy contract net assets for open/unrealized transactions, the net receivable/payable for realized transactions and net open positions for contracts not marked to market. Amounts due from counterparties are offset by liabilities payable to those counterparties to the extent that legally enforceable netting arrangements are in place. Thus, this column presents the net credit exposure to counterparties after reflecting all allowable netting, but before considering collateral held. (c) Credit collateral the face amount of cash deposits, letters of credit and performance bonds received from counterparties, not adjusted for probability of default, and, if applicable, property interests (including oil and natural gas reserves). (d) Using a percentage of the total exposure. Interest Rate Risk Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries variable or floating rate debt is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. Pepco Holdings manages interest rates through the use of fixed and, to a lesser extent, variable rate debt. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates on the annual interest costs for short term and variable rate debt was less than $1 million as of December 31, 2011. 126 Potomac Electric Power Company Interest Rate Risk Pepcos debt is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. Pepco manages interest rates through the use of fixed and, to a lesser extent, variable rate debt. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates on the annual interest costs for short term debt and variable rate debt was less than $1 million as of December 31, 2011. Delmarva Power & Light Company Commodity Price Risk DPL uses derivative instruments (forward contracts, futures, swaps, and exchange traded and over the counter options) primarily to reduce natural gas commodity price volatility while limiting its customers exposure to increases in the market price of natural gas. DPL also manages commodity risk with capacity contracts that do not meet the definition of derivatives. The primary goal of these activities is to reduce the exposure of its regulated retail natural gas customers to natural gas price spikes. All premiums paid and other transaction costs incurred as part of DPLs natural gas hedging activity, in addition to all gains and losses on the natural gas hedging activity, are fully recoverable through the GCR clause included in DPLs natural gas tariff rates approved by the DPSC and are deferred until recovered. At December 31, 2011, after the effects of cash collateral and netting, DPL had a net derivative liability of $15 million, offset by a $17 million regulatory asset. At December 31, 2010, after the effects of cash collateral and netting, DPL had a net derivative liability of $23 million, offset by a $31 million regulatory asset. Interest Rate Risk DPLs debt is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. DPL manages interest rates through the use of fixed and, to a lesser extent, variable rate debt. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates on the annual interest costs for short term debt and variable rate debt was less than $1 million as of December 31, 2011. Atlantic City Electric Company Interest Rate Risk ACEs debt is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. ACE manages interest rates through the use of fixed and, to a lesser extent, variable rate debt. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates on the annual interest costs for short term debt and variable rate debt was less than $1 million as of December 31, 2011. 127
