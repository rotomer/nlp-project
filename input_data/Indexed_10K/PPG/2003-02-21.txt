Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Performance in 2002 Compared with 2001 Overall Performance Our sales decreased 1% to $8.1 billion from $8.2 billion in 2001. Sales declined 2% due to lower selling prices in our glass and chemicals segments. This decline was partially offset by higher volumes in our coatings and chemicals segments, net of lower volumes in our glass segment. The gross profit percentage increased slightly to 37.2% in 2002 from 37.1% in 2001. The increase in gross profit percentage was due to improved manufacturing efficiencies across all of our business segments, lower raw material costs in our coatings segment and lower energy costs. These improvements were substantially offset by lower selling prices in our glass and chemicals segments and higher pension and postretirement medical costs. Reported net (loss) income and (loss) earnings per share diluted in 2002 and 2001 is summarized in the following table. We have also identified significant non recurring items in 2002 and 2001. (Millions, except per share amounts) 2002 2001 Net (loss) income (Loss) earnings per share diluted Net income Earnings per share diluted Net (loss) income, as reported $ (69 ) $ (0.41 ) $ 387 $ 2.29 Non recurring items, net of tax: Asbestos settlement, net (See Note 13) 484 2.85 Restructuring charge (See Note 2) 52 0.31 71 0.42 Cumulative effect of accounting change (See Note 1) 9 0.05 Net income, excluding non recurring items $ 476 $ 2.80 $ 458 $ 2.71 The note references in the above table are found under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Aside from the factors described above, the increase in net income was also due to lower overhead costs in our coatings and glass businesses, lower environmental remediation expenses, higher insurance recoveries, lower interest expense due to the lower debt levels in 2002 and the favorable effects of foreign currency translation primarily from our European operations. These favorable factors were substantially offset by an increase in pension and postretirement medical costs across all of our businesses, the negative effects of inflation and lower equity earnings primarily in our glass segment. Also, as a result of the Companys adoption as of Jan. 1, 2002 of the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the carrying value of goodwill and certain trademarks will no longer be amortized and will instead be tested for impairment annually. Such amortization reduced earnings in 2001 by $32 million after tax or $0.20 a share. Results of Business Segments (Millions) Net sales Operating income 2002 2001 2002 2001 Coatings $ 4,482 $ 4,410 $ 605 $ 495 Glass 2,071 2,236 143 255 Chemicals 1,514 1,523 124 91 Corporate (26 ) (21 ) Total $ 8,067 $ 8,169 $ 846 $ 820 Coatings sales increased $72 million or 2% to $4.5 billion in 2002. Sales increased 1% from improved volumes primarily in our architectural, North American and Asian automotive original equipment and industrial businesses offset, in part, by lower sales volumes in our aerospace and refinish businesses. Sales also increased 1% due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation. Operating income increased to $605 million in 2002 compared to $495 million in 2001. Operating income in 2002 and 2001 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of $73 million and $83 million, respectively. Excluding these charges, operating income in 2002 was $678 million compared to $578 million in 2001. The increase in operating income is attributable to higher sales volume, lower raw material and overhead costs, improved manufacturing efficiencies and the benefit of goodwill and certain trademarks no longer being amortized due to the Companys adoption of SFAS No. 142. These were offset, in part, by higher selling costs in our architectural business, higher pension and postretirement medical costs, inflationary cost increases and $3 million in lower equity earnings primarily due to the write off of a receivable from a customer by one of our Asian joint ventures. Glass sales decreased 7% to $2.1 billion in 2002 from $2.2 billion in 2001. Sales volumes declined 5% principally in our automotive replacement glass, flat glass and fiber glass businesses. Sales also decreased 2% due to lower selling prices principally in our North American automotive original glass, flat glass and fiber glass businesses. Operating income decreased to $143 million in 2002 compared to $255 million in 2001. Operating income in 2002 and 2001 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of $1 million and $10 million, respectively. Excluding these charges, operating income in 2002 was $144 million compared to $265 million in 2001. The decrease in operating income is attributable to lower sales volume and selling prices described above. Operating income also decreased due to lower equity earnings, a shift in sales mix to lower margin products and higher pension and postretirement medical costs offset, in part, by improved manufacturing efficiencies and lower energy and overhead costs. Chemicals sales were $1.5 billion in 2002 and 2001. Sales volumes increased 9% principally from our chlor alkali, fine chemicals and optical products, offset by a 9% decrease in selling prices principally for our chlor alkali products. Operating income increased to $124 million in 2002 from $91 million in 2001. Operating income in 2002 Table of Contents 18 PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. 2002 Annual Report and Form 10 K Managements Discussion and Analysis and 2001 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of $1 million and $7 million, respectively. Excluding these charges, operating income in 2002 was $125 million compared to $98 million in 2001. The increase in operating income is attributable to improved sales volume, improved manufacturing efficiencies across all of our businesses, lower energy costs, and lower environmental remediation expenses, partially offset by lower selling prices for our chlor alkali products and higher pension and postretirement medical costs. Other Significant Factors The Companys pretax loss in 2002 included net periodic pension expense of $54 million as compared to net periodic pension income of $53 million in 2001. The increase in net periodic pension expense is due primarily to a decrease in the market value of pension plan assets, a reduction of the expected return on plan assets assumption for 2002 and the amortization of actuarial losses. Additionally at Dec. 31, 2002, the majority of the Companys defined benefit pension plans had an accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) in excess of plan assets. As a result, the Company recorded an additional minimum pension liability adjustment in 2002. This adjustment reduced the prepaid pension asset by $912 million, increased the intangible pension asset by $96 million and the minimum pension liability by $326 million and reflected a deferred tax benefit of $416 million with a resulting reduction in shareholders equity through an increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss of $726 million. In 2002, the Company resolved all matters related to its federal income tax returns for the years 1994 to 1998, including matters that were on appeal related to the 1994 to 1996 tax returns. In connection with the resolution of these matters, the Company surrendered in July 2002 certain company owned life insurance policies and received proceeds of $32 million, which are included in Reductions of other property and investments in the investing activities section in the Statement of Cash Flows under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The effective tax rate for 2003 is expected to approximate 36%. The decrease in short term debt during 2002 is due principally to the repayment of various U.S. and non U.S. debt obligations. Outlook During 2002, we continued to experience mixed economic signals in the United States. Although we saw strong consumer spending and housing starts, we also saw increased unemployment and low demand in the commercial construction sector. Additionally, increases in industrial production, which trended up for much of the year, fell back in the fourth quarter. Business investment declined in 2002 for the second straight year. Economic results in 2002 also reflect the positive influence of the extension of sales incentive programs by the North American automobile manufacturers which were on and off throughout 2002, offsetting weaker European automotive markets. As we begin the new year, the economic reports indicate that the growth in the U.S. economy appears to have stalled in the fourth quarter of 2002. Factory orders and industrial production in the U.S. declined in December, the U.S. dollar weakened against the Euro and our trade deficit grew. This news creates further uncertainty concerning the outlook for our economy in 2003. The consensus view calls for modest growth in consumer spending and a gradual rise in business investment that would lead to moderate growth in the U.S. economy in the second half of the year. The outlook for the global economy generally lags behind that of the U.S., with some exceptions such as China. That outlook is clouded by uncertainties such as the threat of terrorism or war with Iraq. Despite the challenges of weaker economic conditions in 2002 and 2001, we were able to take several important steps to strengthen our Company as a result of our commitment to financial discipline. First, we elevated our focus on cash flow and were able to pay down over $400 million in debt in 2002 and over $500 million in 2001. Second, as a result of the workforce reductions and other restructuring actions undertaken in 2002 and 2001 and our continued focus on cost reductions and improvements to business processes, we reduced our manufacturing and overhead costs by $140 million in 2002. In 2003, we will continue to focus on reducing costs and improving productivity. We will also continue our efforts to improve our customers results through the delivery of cost effective solutions. These efforts will include developing new products and integrated product/service offerings to meet our customers needs. While the steps taken above will translate into improved profitability, costs for employee benefits continue to grow. We expect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs to increase by about $130 million in 2003, which will reduce earnings per share by about $0.50. This is due to the decline in the market value of the Companys pension plan assets, due primarily to negative investment returns in the U.S. equity market during the last three years, a reduction in our expected rate of return on plan assets assumption to approximately 8.75% for 2003, rising medical costs, particularly for prescription drugs and a lower discount rate assumption. Despite the expected increase in these costs, we do not believe that we will have a mandatory funding requirement under Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) or Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations in the near term, so there will only be a minor impact on cash flows in 2003 as a result of these factors. Another potential risk in 2003 will be increases in energy and raw material costs, particularly for natural gas and petroleum based materials. The factors driving these costs upward have historically created favorable market conditions for pricing in our chlor alkali business. During 2002, we benefited from lower raw material costs, primarily associated with our coatings businesses, as well as from lower natural gas costs. However, in the fourth quarter we began to see this benefit diminish and our natural gas costs in the fourth quarter of 2002 exceeded those for the same period of the prior year. Changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the operating performance of our chemicals and glass segments. Each one dollar change in the price of natural gas per mmbtu (million British thermal units) could have a direct impact of Table of Contents 2002 Annual Report and Form 10 K PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. 19 Managements Discussion and Analysis approximately $60 million on our annual operating costs. It has become increasingly more difficult to predict future natural gas prices, which are expected to continue to be volatile over the next few years. In order to reduce the risks associated with volatile prices, we use a number of techniques, which include hedging, reducing consumption through improved manufacturing processes and switching to alternative fuels. As of Dec. 31, 2002, we hedged approximately one third of our anticipated natural gas requirements for 2003 at an average price of $3.25 per mmbtu. We also expect the continuing consolidation of companies within our customer and competitor groups, excess global automotive production capacity and the availability of imported products from low labor cost markets to lead to continued downward pressure on our selling prices. For 2003, we expect slow and perhaps erratic expansion in our North American markets and gains in our Asian markets. We expect continued softness in our European and South American markets. There are several developments that would signal a more solid economic environment for 2003, the most important of which would be steady growth in industrial production. We expect that 2003 will be another challenging year due to the combination of worldwide political and economic uncertainties, but we are confident that the steps we have taken put us on solid footing to reap the benefits of improved market conditions, both in the U.S. and abroad, whenever they occur. Newly Adopted Accounting Standards Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K describes and quantifies the Companys adoption of the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) standards on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets, effective Jan. 1, 2002. Other New Accounting Standards In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143. Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations which is effective Jan. 1, 2003. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting will decrease our 2003 net income by less than $10 million and will not have a material impact on future results of operations or financial condition. During 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others and Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for an expanded description of these new standards. Additionally, the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure have been implemented in Note 18, Stock Based Compensation, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Performance in 2001 Compared with 2000 Overall Performance Our sales decreased 5% in 2001 to $8.2 billion from $8.6 billion in 2000. The majority of this sales decrease, 4%, is attributable to decreased volumes across all of our business segments. Sales for 2001 also declined 2% from foreign currency translation primarily within our coatings segment due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. These sales decreases were partially offset by a 1% increase in prices within our coatings and glass segments. The gross profit percentage decreased to 37.1% in 2001 from 38.2% in 2000. Increased raw material costs, including natural gas, particularly in our glass and chemicals segments, along with unfavorable sales mix across our glass and chemicals segments were offset slightly by the benefits realized from improved manufacturing efficiencies in our coatings and glass segments. Reported net income and earnings per share diluted in 2001 and 2000 is summarized in the following table. We have also identified significant non recurring items in 2001 and 2000. (Millions, except per share amounts) 2001 2000 Net income Earnings per share diluted Net income Earnings per share diluted Net income, as reported $ 387 $ 2.29 $ 620 $ 3.57 Non recurring items, net of tax: Restructuring charge (See Note 2) 71 0.42 3 0.02 Write off of 50% owned equity investment (See Note 13) 35 0.20 Net income, excluding non recurring items $ 458 $ 2.71 $ 658 $ 3.79 The note references in the above table are found under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The decrease in earnings is largely attributable to the lower sales volume and gross profit percentage described above. In addition, selling, general and administrative expenses were up $31 million as the savings from our restructuring actions of about $35 million were more than offset by the additional overhead costs of businesses acquired during 2000, higher pension and other benefit costs, higher growth related overhead in our architectural coatings business and the impact of inflation. Additional cost reductions of $25 million related to our restructuring actions are reflected in research and development costs and costs of sales. Table of Contents 20 PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. 2002 Annual Report and Form 10 K Managements Discussion and Analysis Results of Business Segments (Millions) Net sales Operating income 2001 2000 2001 2000 Coatings $ 4,410 $ 4,658 $ 495 $ 685 Glass 2,236 2,350 255 377 Chemicals 1,523 1,621 91 174 Corporate (21 ) (54 ) Total $ 8,169 $ 8,629 $ 820 $ 1,182 Coatings sales decreased 5% to $4.4 billion in 2001 from $4.7 billion in 2000. Sales decreased 4% from decreased volumes primarily in our North American automotive original equipment, refinish and industrial businesses. Sales also decreased 2% due to negative effects of foreign currency translation. These decreases were offset slightly by a 1% increase from higher selling prices primarily in our refinish business. Operating income decreased to $495 million in 2001 compared to $685 million in 2000. Operating income in 2001 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of $83 million. Excluding these pretax charges, operating income in 2001 was $578 million. The decrease in operating income is attributable to lower sales volumes and higher environmental, pension and other benefit costs offset, in part, by improved manufacturing efficiencies and lower research and development costs. Glass sales decreased 5% to $2.2 billion in 2001 from $2.4 billion in 2000. Sales decreased 6% from decreased volumes primarily in our North American automotive original and fiber glass businesses and 1% due to the negative effects of foreign currency translation. These declines were offset by a 2% increase in selling prices, due in part to more profitable product mix, in our flat glass, automotive replacement glass and fiber glass businesses. Operating income decreased to $255 million in 2001 compared to $377 million in 2000. Operating income in 2001 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of $10 million and operating income in 2000 included pretax charges of $6 million for restructuring and one time integration costs related to PPG Auto Glass. Excluding these pretax charges, operating income in 2001 was $265 million compared to $383 million in 2000. The decrease in operating income is attributable to lower sales volumes primarily in our North American automotive original and fiber glass businesses, the effects of higher natural gas costs and lower equity earnings, partially offset by improved manufacturing efficiencies, higher selling prices and the inclusion of a full years results of PPG Auto Glass. Chemicals sales decreased 6% to $1.5 billion in 2001 from $1.6 billion in 2000. Sales volumes declined 4% primarily from our chlorine, caustic soda, chlor alkali derivative and silica products. Sales also decreased 1% due to lower selling prices for our chlor alkali derivative products and 1% due to the negative effects of foreign currency translation. Operating income decreased to $91 million in 2001 from $174 million in 2000. Operating income in 2001 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of $7 million. Excluding these pretax charges, operating income in 2001 was $98 million. The decrease in operating income is attributable to lower sales volumes, higher natural gas and environmental costs and decreased manufacturing efficiencies. Other Significant Factors Earnings in 2001 and 2000 included pension income of $53 million and $86 million, respectively. This decline in pension income is due primarily to a decline in the market value of pension plan assets during 2000. The market value of our pension plan assets continued to decrease during 2001 due primarily to the declines in the U.S. equity markets. See Note 12, Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for information concerning the pension plan assets and the components of pension income. Other unallocated corporate expense net, was $21 million in 2001 as compared to $54 million in 2000. Included in 2001 is a pretax charge of $1 million for restructuring and other related costs. Included in 2000 are pretax charges of $39 million representing the write off of a 50% owned equity investment in Pittsburgh Corning Corporation, which has filed for reorganization under the federal bankruptcy code and $14 million representing an other than temporary decline in the market value of an investment in marketable equity securities, previously recorded, net of tax, as an unrealized loss in other comprehensive loss. The tax rate for ongoing operations was 36% in both 2001 and 2000. However, the overall effective tax rate in 2001 was 37.07% as the geographic spread of the restructuring charges taken in the first quarter provided a tax benefit of only 30%. The decrease in short term and long term debt during 2001 is due principally to the repayment of various U.S. and non U.S. debt obligations. Business Restructuring During the first quarter of 2002, the Company finalized plans to reduce costs, increase efficiencies and accelerate performance improvement and took a pretax charge of $81 million for restructuring and other related activities, including severance and other costs of $66 million and asset dispositions of $15 million. It is expected that these activities will be completed by June 2003. The details of this charge were as follows: (Millions, except no. of employees) Severance and Other Costs Asset Dispositions Total Charge Employees Covered Coatings $ 62 $ 15 $ 77 1,004 Glass 1 1 22 Chemicals 1 1 20 Corporate 2 2 20 Total $ 66 $ 15 $ 81 1,066 Activity (28 ) (15 ) (43 ) (686 ) Balance at Dec. 31, 2002 $ 38 $ $ 38 380 Table of Contents 2002 Annual Report and Form 10 K PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. 21 Managements Discussion and Analysis During the first quarter of 2001, the Company finalized plans to reduce costs, increase efficiencies and accelerate performance improvement and took a pretax charge of $101 million for restructuring and other related activities, including severance and other costs of $67 million and asset dispositions of $34 million. As of Dec. 31, 2002, these actions are complete. The details of this charge were as follows: (Millions, except no. of employees) Severance and Other Costs Asset Dispositions Total Charge Employees Covered Coatings $ 60 $ 23 $ 83 1,072 Glass 4 6 10 254 Chemicals 2 5 7 23 Corporate 1 1 18 Total $ 67 $ 34 $ 101 1,367 Activity (67 ) (34 ) (101 ) (1,367 ) Balance at Dec. 31, 2002 $ $ $ In conjunction with the 2001 first quarter charge, an additional $2 million of restructuring costs were recorded in 2001 as incurred and during the second quarter of 2002, $4 million of the initial $101 million charge related to the coatings segment was reversed to income. During 2002 and 2001, we paid $2 million and $17 million, respectively, related to restructuring reserves accrued in 2000 and 1999. See Note 2, Acquisitions and Business Restructuring, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for an expanded description of these restructuring actions. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, including Environmental Matters PPG is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against others, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. See Note 13, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for an expanded description of certain of these lawsuits, including the proposed settlement of asbestos claims announced on May 14, 2002. As discussed in Note 13, although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable, management believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving PPG, including asbestos related claims in the event the settlement described in Note 13 does not become effective, will not have a material effect on PPGs consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. It is PPGs policy to accrue expenses for environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted. As of Dec. 31, 2002 and 2001, PPG had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling $87 million and $94 million, respectively. Pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2002, 2001 and 2000 totaled $15 million, $29 million and $18 million, respectively, and are included in Other charges in the Statement of Income under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated $22 million, $19 million and $16 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Management anticipates that the resolution of the Companys environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time. Over the past 10 years the pretax charges against income have ranged between $10 million and $49 million per year. We anticipate that charges against income in 2003 will be within that range. It is possible, however, that technological, regulatory and enforcement developments, the results of environmental studies and other factors could alter this expectation. In managements opinion, the Company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the Companys environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on PPGs financial position or liquidity. In addition to the amounts currently reserved, the Company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as $200 million to $400 million, which range is unchanged from the prior year end. Such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence. The Companys environmental contingencies are expected to be resolved over an extended period of time. Although the unreserved exposure to future loss relates to all sites, a significant portion of such exposure involves three operating plant sites in our chemicals segment. Initial remedial actions are occurring at these sites. Studies to determine the nature of the contamination are reaching completion and the need for additional remedial actions, if any, is presently being evaluated. The loss contingencies related to the remaining portion of such unreserved exposure include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination, if any, at these other sites and the methods that may have to be employed should remediation be required. The most significant of these sites is the Calcasieu River estuary, near our Lake Charles, La. chemicals plant. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has been investigating contamination levels in the Calcasieu River estuary. During 2002, the USEPA issued draft Human Health and Ecological Risk Assessments indicating that elevated levels of risk exist in the estuary. It is expected that USEPA could issue final risk assessments in 2003 followed by a Remedial Investigation report. PPG would then have discussions with the USEPA and other parties to determine what, if any, role PPG would have in addressing estuary issues. Table of Contents 22 PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. 2002 Annual Report and Form 10 K Managements Discussion and Analysis With respect to certain waste sites, the financial condition of any other potentially responsible parties also contributes to the uncertainty of estimating PPGs final costs. Although contributors of waste to sites involving other potentially responsible parties may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability, in general, final allocations of costs are made based on the relative contributions of wastes to such sites. PPG is generally not a major contributor to such sites. The impact of evolving programs, such as natural resource damage claims, industrial site reuse initiatives and state voluntary remediation programs, also adds to the present uncertainties with regard to the ultimate resolution of this unreserved exposure to future loss. The Companys assessment of the potential impact of these environmental contingencies is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex, ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation, if necessary, of such environmental contingencies. Impact of Inflation PPGs financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, which does not completely account for the effects of inflation. In 2002, the decline in selling prices and the negative effects of inflation on our production costs were not fully recovered through improved manufacturing efficiencies across all of our businesses and lower raw material and natural gas costs. In 2001, the increase in production costs due to the negative effects of inflation was not fully recovered through price increases and manufacturing efficiencies, which were adversely impacted by lower production volumes. In 2000, the negative effects of inflation, including the impact of higher natural gas costs, were substantially offset in the aggregate by the impact of higher selling prices in our glass and chemicals businesses and manufacturing efficiencies in all of our businesses. While inflationary and market pressures on costs are expected to be experienced in 2003, we anticipate that ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies, improvement in sales volume as well as increases in selling prices for certain products will more than offset the negative effect of inflation on 2003 operating income. Financial Resources, Capital Spending During the past three years, we continued to have sufficient financial resources to meet operating requirements, to fund our capital spending and share repurchase programs and to pay increased dividends to shareholders. Cash from operating activities was $872 million, $1,060 million and $870 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Dividends paid to shareholders totaled $287 million, $283 million and $276 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. During 2002, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock nor does it anticipate, in the near term, that any shares will be repurchased. However, during 2001 and 2000, the Company repurchased approximately 0.1 million and 5.8 million shares of common stock at a cost of $5 million and $234 million, respectively, under various share repurchase programs. The program initiated in November 1998 authorized the repurchase of 10 million shares of common stock. As of Dec. 31, 2002, 9.1 million shares of common stock had been repurchased under this program at a cost of $421 million. In October 2000, we authorized a program to repurchase an additional 10 million shares of common stock. The repurchase of common stock was financed principally by cash from operations and proceeds from long term debt. Additional shares were repurchased from the PPG Employee Savings Plan. Capital spending was $260 million, $301 million and $676 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This spending related to business acquisitions totaling $22 million, $10 million and $115 million, in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, modernization and productivity improvements, expansion of existing businesses, and environmental control projects. Capital spending in 2000 also included $83 million for marketable securities relating to the deferred compensation plan. Capital spending, excluding acquisitions, is expected to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million during 2003. We periodically review our array of businesses in comparison to our overall strategic and performance objectives. As part of this review, we may acquire or divest of certain businesses. During 2003, we anticipate that any acquisitions completed will be funded through a combination of cash generated from operations or from the sale of other businesses and, to a lesser extent, external funding sources or the issuance of stock. Table of Contents 2002 Annual Report and Form 10 K PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. 23 Managements Discussion and Analysis The ratio of total debt, including capital leases, to total debt and equity was 49% and 44% at Dec. 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. While we reduced our debt by over $400 million during 2002, this ratio was negatively impacted as equity was reduced by the after tax impact of the asbestos settlement charge and the minimum pension liability adjustment recorded in 2002. Cash from operations and the Companys debt capacity are expected to continue to be sufficient to fund capital spending, dividend payments, contributions to pension plans, amounts due under the asbestos settlement and operating requirements, including PPGs significant contractual obligations, which are presented in the following table: Obligations Due In: 2004 2006 (Millions) Total 2003 2005 2007 Thereafter Long term debt $ 1,721 $ 22 $ 455 $ 182 $ 1,062 Capital lease obligations 10 10 Operating leases 266 63 88 52 63 Unconditional purchase obligations 843 218 124 93 408 Total $ 2,840 $ 313 $ 667 $ 327 $ 1,533 The unconditional purchase commitments are principally take or pay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials, including industrial gases and natural gas, consistent with customary industry practice. These also include PPGs commitment to purchase electricity and steam from the RS Cogen joint venture discussed in Note 5, Investments, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. See Note 7, Debt and Bank Credit Agreements and Leases, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit, letters of credit, guarantees, and debt covenants. In addition to the lines of credit, the Company may issue up to $500 million aggregate principal amount of debt securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July 1999. Critical Accounting Policies Management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes under Item 8 of this Form 10 K and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate. We believe that the most critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements relate to accounting for contingencies, under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated, and to accounting for pensions, other postretirement benefits, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies. Contingencies, by their nature, relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss. The most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable, environmental remediation, pending litigation against the Company and the resolution of matters related to open tax years. For more information on these matters, see Note 3, Working Capital Detail, Note 11, Income Taxes and Note 13, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works. To accomplish this, extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, turnover, medical costs and discount rates. These assumptions are reviewed annually. In determining the expected return on plan asset assumption, the Company evaluates long term actual return information, the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and future estimates of long term investment returns. In selecting rates for current and long term health care assumptions, the Company takes into consideration a number of factors including the Companys actual health care cost increases, the design of the Companys benefit programs, the demographics of the Companys active and retiree populations and expectations of inflation rates out into the future. See Note 12, Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for information on these plans. As discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K, the Company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of such assets to their carrying values. Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows. As part of our ongoing financial reporting process, a collaborative effort is undertaken involving PPG managers with functional responsibility for financial, credit, environmental, legal, tax and benefit matters and outside advisors such as consultants, engineers, lawyers and actuaries. The results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments on these contingencies and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements. We believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K related to these contingencies, pensions, postretirement benefits, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate PPG management, although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates. Table of Contents 24 PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. 2002 Annual Report and Form 10 K Managements Discussion and Analysis Currency The Euro and the British Pound Sterling strengthened against the U.S. dollar 18% and 11%, respectively, during 2002. The effects of translating the net assets and net earnings of our operations denominated in these currencies to the U.S. dollar increased consolidated net assets by approximately $140 million but did not have a significant impact on the results of operations. This was offset, in part, by the continued devaluation of the Argentine peso, which reduced our net investment in Argentina by $39 million to a total of $29 million at Dec. 31, 2002. Any reduction in the value of these net assets resulting from a further devaluation of the Argentine peso will result in a direct charge to the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of shareholders equity. Research and Development Innovation and technology have been a hallmark of our Companys success throughout its history. Research and development costs totaled over 3% of sales in each of the past three years, representing a level of expenditure that we expect to continue in 2003. These costs include technology driven improvements to our manufacturing processes and customer technical service, as well as the costs of developing new products. Because of our broad array of products and customers, we are not materially dependent upon any single technology platform. Forward Looking Statements The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. Managements Discussion and Analysis and other sections of this Annual Report contain forward looking statements that reflect the Companys current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward looking statements are identified by the use of the words aim, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate and other expressions that indicate future events and trends. Any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the SEC. Also, note the following cautionary statements. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the Companys forward looking statements. Among these factors are increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors, fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials, the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, economic and political conditions in international markets, the ability to penetrate existing, developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets, which also depends on economic and political conditions, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates, and the unpredictability of possible future litigation, including litigation that could result if the asbestos settlement does not become effective. Further, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, while the list of factors presented here is considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward looking statements. The consequences of material differences in the results as compared to those anticipated in the forward looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, operations or liquidity. Table of Contents 2002 Annual Report and Form 10 K PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. 25 Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk PPG is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and natural gas prices arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business. The Company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce this market risk. A detailed description of these exposures and the Companys risk management policies are provided in Note 9, Derivative Financial Instruments, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2002 and 2001 were used to hedge PPGs exposure to foreign currency transaction and translation risk. The fair value of these contracts was an asset of $1 million as of Dec. 31, 2002 and 2001. The potential reduction in PPGs earnings resulting from adverse changes in the exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for European currencies and 20% for Asian and South American currencies would have totaled approximately $1 million and $4 million as of Dec. 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. PPG had non U.S. dollar denominated debt of $317 million and $409 million as of Dec. 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. A weakening of the U.S. dollar by 10% against European currencies and by 20% against Asian and South American currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately $46 million and $59 million as of Dec. 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of PPGs interest rate risk and, as of Dec. 31, 2002 and 2001, the fair value of the interest rate swaps was an asset of $23 million and a liability of $20 million, respectively. The fair value of these swaps would have decreased by $7 million as of Dec. 31, 2002 and increased by $11 million as of Dec. 31, 2001, if variable interest rates changed unfavorably by 10%. A 10% increase in interest rates in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in Asia and South America would have affected PPGs variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense by approximately $3 million and $6 million as of Dec. 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the Companys fixed rate debt by approximately $53 million and $62 million as of Dec. 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Such changes would not have had a material effect on PPGs annual earnings or cash flows. The fair value of natural gas swap and option contracts was an asset of $24 million and a liability of $12 million as of Dec. 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These contracts were entered into to reduce PPGs exposure to rising prices of natural gas. A 10% reduction in the price of natural gas would result in a loss in the fair value of the underlying natural gas swap and option contracts outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2002 and 2001 of approximately $8 million and $12 million, respectively. In November 2002, an equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the Companys exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute PPG stock into an asbestos settlement trust (see Note 9, Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 13, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K). The fair value of this instrument as of Dec. 31, 2002 was an asset of $1 million. A 10% unfavorable change in PPGs stock price would have reduced the value of this instrument to a liability of $2 million.
