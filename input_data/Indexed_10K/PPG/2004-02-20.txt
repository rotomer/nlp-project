Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Performance in 2003 Compared with 2002 Overall Performance Our sales increased 9% to $8.8 billion in 2003 from $8.1 billion in 2002. Sales increased 4% due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation, primarily from our European operations, 3% due to improved volumes across all of our business segments and 2% due to higher selling prices, primarily in our chemicals segment. The gross profit percentage decreased slightly to 36.9% in 2003 from 37.2% in 2002. Higher pension and postretirement medical costs across all of our business segments, higher energy costs in our glass and chemicals segments and inflationary cost increases were offset by higher selling prices in our chemicals segment and the benefits realized from improved manufacturing efficiencies in our coatings and glass segments. Net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share diluted for 2003 and 2002 are presented in the following table along with the more significant charges that were included in those amounts. 2003 2002 (Millions, except per share amounts) Netincome Earningsper share diluted Net(loss)income (Loss)earningsper share diluted Net income (loss) $ 494 $ 2.89 $ (69 ) $ (0.41 ) Included in net income (loss) are the following significant charges, net of tax: Asbestos settlement net (See Note 13) 23 0.14 484 2.85 Restructuring and other related activities (See Note 2) 2 0.01 52 0.31 Cumulative effect of accounting change (See Note 1) 6 0.03 9 0.05 The notes referenced in the above table are found under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Net income for 2003 compared to 2002 was $563 million higher. The significant charges in the table above account for $514 million of this change. The remaining $49 million increase in net income was due to a combination of factors. The factors causing 2003 net income to be higher were higher selling prices in our chemicals segment, higher sales volumes across all of our business segments, the favorable effects of foreign currency translation, primarily from our European operations, improved manufacturing efficiencies and lower overhead costs in our coatings and glass segments, the gain on the sale of certain non strategic assets, including marketable securities, and lower interest expense due to lower debt levels in 2003. Higher pension and postretirement medical costs across all of our business segments, higher energy costs in our glass and chemicals segments and the negative effects of inflation were factors reducing 2003 net income. Results of Business Segments Net sales Operating income (Millions) 2003 2002 2003 2002 Coatings $ 4,835 $ 4,482 $ 707 $ 605 Glass 2,150 2,071 71 143 Chemicals 1,771 1,514 232 124 Corporate (32 ) (26 ) Total $ 8,756 $ 8,067 $ 978 $ 846 Coatings sales increased $353 million or 8% in 2003. Sales increased 6% due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation, primarily from our European operations and 2% from improved volumes primarily from our aerospace, architectural, automotive and industrial businesses. Lower pricing in our automotive business offset higher pricing in our other coatings businesses. Operating income increased $102 million in 2003. Operating income in 2003 and 2002 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of $2 million and $73 million, respectively. Factors increasing operating income were lower restructuring costs in 2003, the higher sales volumes described above, improved manufacturing efficiencies, the favorable effects of foreign currency translation and lower overhead costs. Factors decreasing operating income were inflationary cost increases and higher pension and postretirement medical costs. Glass sales increased $79 million or 4% in 2003. Sales increased 4% from improved volumes primarily from our automotive original equipment, automotive replacement glass and flat glass businesses, net of lower volumes from our fiber glass business. Sales also increased 3% due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation, primarily from our European fiber glass operations. These sales increases were offset by a 3% decline due to lower selling prices from our automotive original equipment, automotive replacement glass and fiber glass businesses. Operating income decreased $72 million in 2003. Operating income in 2003 and 2002 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of $2 million and $1 million, respectively. Factors decreasing operating income were lower selling prices of $68 million, higher pension and postretirement medical costs of $65 million and higher energy costs of $30 million. Factors increasing operating income in 2003 by $91 million were the improved manufacturing efficiencies, lower overhead costs, the higher sales volumes described above and the favorable effects of foreign currency translation. Our fiber glass business continues to experience significant sales and earnings declines principally as a result of global industry overcapacity, which has led to substantially lower pricing. 2003 Annual Report and Form 10 K PPG Industries, Inc. 17 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis Chemicals sales increased $257 million or 17% in 2003. Sales increased 13% from higher selling prices for our commodity products. Sales also increased 3% due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation, primarily from our European operations and 1% from higher optical, fine and silicas products volumes, net of lower commodity volumes. Operating income increased $108 million in 2003. Operating income in 2002 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of $1 million. Higher commodity product pricing in 2003 increased operating earnings by $200 million while higher energy and pension and postretirement medical costs decreased operating earnings by $70 million and $18 million, respectively. Other Significant Factors The Companys pretax earnings in 2003 included net periodic pension expense of $176 million compared to $54 million in 2002. The increase in pension costs is due primarily to a decrease in the market value of pension plan assets through the end of 2002, a reduction in the expected return on plan assets assumption for 2003 and the amortization of accumulated actuarial losses. In addition, the cost of other postretirement benefits in 2003 was $115 million compared to $91 million in 2002. On a combined basis, the increase in net periodic benefit cost of $146 million was $52 million for the coatings segment, $65 million for the glass segment, $18 million for the chemicals segment and $11 million for corporate. Although the majority of the Companys defined benefit plans continued to be underfunded on an accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) basis as of Dec. 31, 2003, the underfunded amount was lower, which resulted in an increase in shareholders equity through a decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive income of $147 million, aftertax. See Note 12, Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for additional information. The effective tax rate for 2003 was approximately 35% and is expected to be the same for 2004. Outlook The U.S. economy continued to gain strength in late 2003. Consumer confidence, buoyed by tax cuts, low interest rates and overall improvements in the U.S. equity markets, improved during the year, particularly during the fourth quarter. The commercial construction sector remained at very low levels, but has been showing signs of improvement throughout the second half of the year. Increases in industrial production have been positive since July; however, for the full year, growth was only slightly positive. Strong consumer confidence has been a key driver of the current economic recovery, including its impact on automotive sales. European automotive markets were weak at the beginning of the year but have improved although, as with the U.S. markets, sales were below the high levels of the past few years. As the new year begins, the economic reports suggest that the U.S. economy is poised for growth, extending the improvement that was seen in the second half of the year. For 2004, we expect the U.S. economy to settle into a more stable pattern in terms of quarterly GDP growth compared to 2003. Interest rates should remain at historically low levels much of this year and continue to support economic expansion. Increasing values of stock portfolios are likely to be a positive factor while the benefit from households refinancing their debt is unlikely to provide the same boost as it has during the industrial slowdown of the past few years. Overall global economic growth in 2004 is expected to reach its highest level since 2000, possibly exceeding three percent in terms of real GDP growth. Growth in Europe is likely to be negatively impacted by the strength of the euro, which hit a new all time high against the U.S. dollar in January of 2004. Economic growth in South America will probably remain relatively slow compared to most other regions. The Asian market should once again post solid growth, especially in China. The Chinese economy is the fastest growing of the worlds ten largest economies, with production of vehicles and consumer goods increasing at significant rates. While this provides an attractive market for our coatings products, it also encourages expansion of production in the region, which in turn contributes to the downward price pressure on some of our glass and fiber glass businesses, where there is excess global capacity and we compete against products produced in China and other low labor cost markets. While we have consistently focused on reducing our costs, we continue to be challenged by high and rising costs for employee benefits, particularly pensions and medical. Prior to 2001, our pension income more than offset retiree medical costs. In 2003 pension expense combined with other postretirement benefit costs were nearly $300 million. This increase in costs results from a combination of the decline in the market value of the companys pension plans assets, due primarily to negative investment returns in the U.S. equity market during 2000 2002, a reduction in our expected future rate of return on pension plan assets, lower discount rate assumption and rising medical costs, particularly for prescription drugs. This cost increase translates to about $1.19 per share in lower earnings in 2003 compared with 2000. While the current low interest rate environment is expected to continue, which raises the present value of future benefit obligations, there was some brighter news in 2003 with respect to our U.S. pension plans as a result of an actual return on plan assets for the year of a little more than 25%. Consequently, the underfunded status of these plans was reduced, along with our recorded minimum pension liability. Additionally, even though the plans continue to be underfunded, we will not be required to make a mandatory funding contribution to the U.S. plans under Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation or IRS regulations until at least 2007, even if our plan assets stay flat with December 2003 levels. These developments are also good news for 2004 pension costs which are currently estimated to be slightly less than those in 2003. Other postretirement benefit costs, however, in 2004 are expected to be about $15 million higher than last year. This increase in costs does not include the benefit of any anticipated reductions 18 2003 Annual Report and Form 10 K PPG Industries, Inc. Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis as a result of the implementation of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act). PPG is currently evaluating the provisions of the Act and its potential impact to our postretirement medical plans which we believe will ultimately reduce our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and other postretirement benefit costs. High natural gas costs in North America continue to be a drag on earnings. Changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the operating performance of our chemicals and glass segments. Each one dollar change in the price of natural gas per mmbtu (million British thermal units) would have a direct impact of approximately $60 million to $70 million on our annual operating costs. It is difficult to predict future natural gas prices, which continue to be high and volatile. In order to reduce the risks associated with volatile prices, we use a number of techniques, which include reducing consumption through improved manufacturing processes, switching to alternative fuels and hedging. As of Dec. 31, 2003, we had hedged approximately ten percent of our anticipated natural gas requirements for 2004 at an average price of $4.80 per mmbtu. Factoring in the expected benefit from these hedges, based on an average cost for January and February 2004 of approximately $6.00, the average cost for natural gas in the first quarter of 2004 would be approximately $5.90 per mmbtu, or an increase of about 6% over the average cost of natural gas in the first quarter of 2003. In 2004, we see the potential for increases in the prices for raw materials used in our coatings businesses, especially as the economic expansion begins to gain momentum. At the same time the anticipated growth in industrial production may strengthen the end use markets of our chlor alkali customers and support higher ECU prices, which had declined at the end of 2003 even though they rose significantly for the full year compared with 2002. We expect to remain focused in 2004 on serving our customer needs, investing in technology to bring new products to market and reducing our costs. Further, we have a demonstrated track record of generating cash, as evidenced by the $3.1 billion in cash from operating activities over the 2001 2003 time period. After capital spending, which we have managed tightly, and payment of dividends to our shareholders, we have been directing our cash flow to reduce debt by more than $1.3 billion over the past three years. We plan to use our cash in a similar manner in 2004. We are well positioned to face the challenges that come our way during 2004. We remain confident that our focus on growing revenues while continuously working to improve our manufacturing efficiencies and lower our costs will enable PPG to once again take advantage of economic growth, both in the U.S. and international markets. Accounting Standard Adopted in 2004 Effective Jan. 1, 2004, we adopted the fair value method of recording stock based compensation, as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, for stock options awarded to employees after the date of adoption and for previously issued stock options that were not vested as of Jan. 1, 2004 using the modified prospective transition method. We expect the impact of adoption to increase 2004 stock based compensation expense by approximately $10 million, aftertax, or $0.06 per share. This impact reflects the fact that beginning in 2004 stock option grants under the PPG Stock Plan will vest three years after the date of grant. Previously, original grants of stock options under this plan vested after one year. As a result of this vesting provision and assuming the number of options granted in 2004 and 2005 and the fair value of those options is comparable to those granted in 2003, the impact of this accounting change will grow to approximately $0.09 and $0.12 per share in 2005 and 2006, respectively, at which time a full annual run rate of expense is reached. Additionally, under the modified prospective transition method we are required to record a deferred tax asset of $9 million and a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital equal to the deferred tax benefit that would have been recognized in 2003 had compensation expense been recorded under the fair value provisions of SFAS No. 123 for options outstanding at the date of adoption but not fully vested. Performance in 2002 Compared with 2001 Overall Performance Our sales decreased 1% to $8.1 billion from $8.2 billion in 2001. Sales declined 2% due to lower selling prices in our glass and chemicals segments. This decline was partially offset by higher volumes in our coatings and chemicals segments, net of lower volumes in our glass segment. The gross profit percentage increased slightly to 37.2% in 2002 from 37.1% in 2001. The increase in gross profit percentage was due to improved manufacturing efficiencies across all of our business segments, lower raw material costs in our coatings segment and lower energy costs. These improvements were substantially offset by lower selling prices in our glass and chemicals segments and higher pension and postretirement medical costs. 2003 Annual Report and Form 10 K PPG Industries, Inc. 19 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis Net (loss) income and (loss) earnings per share diluted for 2002 and 2001 are presented in the following table along with the more significant charges that were included in those amounts. 2002 2001 (Millions, except per share amounts) Net(loss)income (Loss)earningsper share diluted Netincome Earningsper share diluted Net (loss) income $ (69 ) $ (0.41 ) $ 387 $ 2.29 Included in net (loss) income are the following significant charges, net of tax: Asbestos settlement net (See Note 13) 484 2.85 Restructuring and other related activities (See Note 2) 52 0.31 71 0.42 Cumulative effect of accounting change (See Note 1) 9 0.05 The notes referenced in the above table are found under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Net (loss) income for 2002 compared to 2001 was $456 million lower. The significant charges in the table above account for $474 million of this change. The remaining $18 million increase in net (loss) income was due to lower overhead costs in our coatings and glass businesses, lower environmental remediation expenses, higher insurance recoveries, lower interest expense due to the lower debt levels in 2002 and the favorable effects of foreign currency translation primarily from our European operations. These favorable factors were substantially offset by an increase in pension and postretirement medical costs across all of our businesses, the negative effects of inflation and lower equity earnings primarily in our glass segment. Also, as a result of the Companys adoption as of Jan. 1, 2002 of the provisions of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the carrying value of goodwill and certain trademarks will no longer be amortized and will instead be tested for impairment annually. Such amortization reduced earnings in 2001 by $32 million aftertax or $0.20 a share. Results of Business Segments Net sales Operating income (Millions) 2002 2001 2002 2001 Coatings $ 4,482 $ 4,410 $ 605 $ 495 Glass 2,071 2,236 143 255 Chemicals 1,514 1,523 124 91 Corporate (26 ) (21 ) Total $ 8,067 $ 8,169 $ 846 $ 820 Coatings sales increased $72 million or 2% in 2002. Sales increased 1% from improved volumes primarily in our architectural, North American and Asian automotive original equipment and industrial businesses offset, in part, by lower sales volumes in our aerospace and refinish businesses. Sales also increased 1% due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation. Operating income increased $110 million in 2002. Operating income in 2002 and 2001 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of $73 million and $83 million, respectively. The increase in operating income is attributable to higher sales volume, lower raw material and overhead costs, improved manufacturing efficiencies, lower restructuring costs in 2002 and the benefit of goodwill and certain trademarks no longer being amortized due to the Companys adoption of SFAS No. 142. These were offset, in part, by higher selling costs in our architectural business, higher pension and postretirement medical costs, inflationary cost increases and $3 million in lower equity earnings primarily due to the write off of a receivable from a customer by one of our Asian joint ventures. Glass sales decreased $165 million or 7% in 2002. Sales volumes declined 5% principally in our automotive replacement glass, flat glass and fiber glass businesses. Sales also decreased 2% due to lower selling prices principally in our North American automotive original glass, flat glass and fiber glass businesses. Operating income decreased $112 million in 2002. Operating income in 2002 and 2001 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of $1 million and $10 million, respectively. The decrease in operating income is attributable to lower sales volume and selling prices described above. Operating income also decreased due to lower equity earnings, a shift in sales mix to lower margin products and higher pension and postretirement medical costs offset, in part, by improved manufacturing efficiencies, lower restructuring costs in 2002 and lower energy and overhead costs. Chemicals sales decreased $9 million in 2002. Sales volumes increased 9% principally from our chlor alkali, fine chemicals and optical products, offset by a 9% decrease in selling prices principally for our chlor alkali products. Operating income increased $33 million in 2002. Operating income in 2002 and 2001 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of $1 million and $7 million, respectively. The increase in operating income is attributable to improved sales volume, improved manufacturing efficiencies across all of our businesses, lower energy costs, lower restructuring costs in 2002, and lower environmental remediation expenses, partially offset by lower selling prices for our chlor alkali products and higher pension and postretirement medical costs. Other Significant Factors The Companys pretax loss in 2002 included net periodic pension expense of $54 million as compared to net periodic pension income of $53 million in 2001. The increase in net periodic pension expense is due primarily to a decrease in the market value of pension plan assets, a reduction of the expected return on plan assets assumption for 2002 and the amortization of accumulated actuarial losses. Additionally as of Dec. 31, 2002, the majority of the Companys defined benefit pension plans had an ABO in excess of plan assets. As a result, the Company recorded an additional minimum pension liability adjustment in 2002. This adjustment reduced the prepaid pension asset by $912 20 2003 Annual Report and Form 10 K PPG Industries, Inc. Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis million, increased the intangible pension asset by $96 million and the minimum pension liability by $326 million and reflected a deferred tax benefit of $416 million with a resulting reduction in shareholders equity through an increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss of $726 million. In 2002, the Company resolved all matters related to its federal income tax returns for the years 1994 to 1998, including matters that were on appeal related to the 1994 to 1996 tax returns. In connection with the resolution of these matters, the Company surrendered in July 2002 certain company owned life insurance policies and received proceeds of $32 million, which are included in Reductions of other property and investments in the investing activities section in the Statement of Cash Flows under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The decrease in short term debt during 2002 is due principally to the repayment of various U.S. and non U.S. debt obligations. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, including Environmental Matters PPG is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against others, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. In a suit filed by Marvin Windows and Doors, PPG has appealed the $156 million judgment awarded by a federal jury. The appeals court has heard the parties arguments, but has not yet rendered its decision. PPG believes it has meritorious defenses to the plaintiffs claims and has reasonable prospects of prevailing on appeal. See Note 13, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for an expanded description of this case and certain other lawsuits, including the proposed PPG Settlement Arrangement for asbestos claims announced on May 14, 2002. As discussed in Note 13, although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable, management believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving PPG, including asbestos related claims in the event the PPG Settlement Arrangement described in Note 13 does not become effective, will not have a material effect on PPGs consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. It is PPGs policy to accrue expenses for environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted. As of Dec. 31, 2003 and 2002, PPG had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling $92 million and $87 million, respectively. Pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2003, 2002 and 2001 totaled $21 million, $15 million and $29 million, respectively, and are included in Other charges in the accompanying statement of income. Cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated $16 million, $22 million and $19 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In addition to the amounts currently reserved, the Company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as $200 million to $400 million, which range is unchanged from the prior year end. Such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence. Management anticipates that the resolution of the Companys environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time. Over the past 10 years the pretax charges against income have ranged between $10 million and $49 million per year. We anticipate that charges against income in 2004 will be within that range. See Note 13, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for an expanded description of certain of these environmental contingencies. In managements opinion, the Company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the Companys environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on PPGs financial position or liquidity. In June 2003, our partner in a fiber glass joint venture in South America filed for bankruptcy. Upon resolution of the bankruptcy proceedings, the partners ownership interest may transfer to one of its senior secured creditors or be sold. While PPG expects operations at the joint venture to continue, the Company is currently evaluating its options with respect to this venture, which include its sale or the liquidation of the venture. Should liquidation occur, PPGs exposure to loss would be limited to $12 million, which includes a combination of the Companys investment, outstanding receivables and a loan guarantee related to this venture. Impact of Inflation PPGs financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, which does not completely account for the effects of inflation. In 2003, the increase in production costs due to the negative effects of inflation, including the impact of higher energy costs in our glass and chemicals segments, was offset by the impact of higher selling prices in our chemicals segment and the improved manufacturing efficiencies in our coatings and glass segments. In 2002, the decline in selling prices and the negative effects of inflation on our production costs were not fully recovered through improved manufacturing efficiencies across all of our businesses and lower raw material and natural gas costs. In 2001, the increase in production costs due to the negative effects of inflation was not fully recovered through price increases and manufacturing efficiencies, which were adversely impacted by lower production volumes. In 2004, the expected inflationary and market pressures on costs as well as a decline in selling prices will not be fully recovered by ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies. 2003 Annual Report and Form 10 K PPG Industries, Inc. 21 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis Liquidity and Capital Resources During the past three years, we continued to have sufficient financial resources to meet our operating requirements, to fund our capital spending, share repurchase programs and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to our shareholders. Cash from operating activities was $1,123 million, $872 million and $1,060 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Capital spending was $220 million, $260 million and $301 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. This spending related to modernization and productivity improvements, expansion of existing businesses, environmental control projects and business acquisitions, which amounted to $3 million, $22 million and $10 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Capital spending, excluding acquisitions, is expected to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million during 2004. We periodically review our array of businesses in comparison to our overall strategic and performance objectives. As part of this review, we may acquire or divest of certain businesses or enter into joint ventures with other companies. During 2004, we anticipate that any acquisitions completed will be funded through a combination of cash generated from operations or from the sale of other businesses and, to a lesser extent, external funding sources or the issuance of stock. Dividends paid to shareholders totaled $294 million, $287 million and $283 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. PPG has paid uninterrupted dividends since 1899, and 2003 marked the 32nd consecutive year of increased dividend payments to shareholders. Over time, our goal is to sustain our dividends at approximately one third of our earnings per share. The Company has two authorized share repurchase programs. Under the program initiated in November 1998, there are 0.9 million of common stock authorized for repurchase remaining. In October 2000, we authorized another program to repurchase an additional 10 million shares of common stock. During 2003 and 2002, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock and in 2001 repurchased only 0.1 million shares at a cost of $5 million. However, the Company announced on January 15, 2004, that it will begin to repurchase shares of common stock from time to time in market transactions of small amounts. Through mid February 2004, we have repurchased 0.1 million shares of PPG common stock at a cost of $6 million. While we had no mandatory funding contribution required in 2003 under Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation or IRS regulations for our U.S. pension plans, we chose to make a voluntary contribution to these plans of $22 million. For 2004, we have no mandatory funding contribution required for our U.S. plans, although we may make further voluntary contributions. During 2003, 2002 and 2001 we made contributions to our non U.S. pension plans totaling $41 million, $20 million and $13 million, respectively. We expect to make contributions to our non U.S. plans in 2004 of approximately $30 million. During 2003, after meeting the needs for funding the matters described above, we were able to repay nearly $400 million of debt, bringing the total reduction in debt over the last three years to more than $1.3 billion. Consequently, the ratio of total debt, including capital leases, to total debt and equity declined to 36% at Dec. 31, 2003 from 49% at Dec. 31, 2002. We were also able to increase our cash by about $375 million in 2003. The Company has invested this cash on a short term basis in high credit quality cash equivalents. Cash from operations and the Companys debt capacity are expected to continue to be sufficient to fund capital spending, share repurchase, dividend payments, contributions to pension plans, amounts due under the asbestos settlement and operating requirements, including PPGs significant contractual obligations, which are presented in the following table along with amounts due under the asbestos settlement: Obligations Due In: (Millions) Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Contractual Obligations Long term debt $ 1,651 $ 312 $ 142 $ 165 $ 1,032 Capital lease obligations 1 1 Operating leases 269 69 97 55 48 Unconditional purchase obligations 878 213 147 87 431 Total $ 2,799 $ 595 $ 386 $ 307 $ 1,511 Asbestos Settlement(1) Aggregate cash payments $ 998 $ 173 $ 173 $ 104 $ 548 PPG stock and other 135 135 Total $ 1,133 $ 308 $ 173 $ 104 $ 548 (1) We have recorded an obligation equal to the net present value of the aggregate cash payments, along with the PPG stock and other assets that will be contributed to the Asbestos Settlement Trust. However, PPG has no obligation to pay any amounts under this settlement until the Effective Date, as more fully discussed in Note 13, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The unconditional purchase commitments are principally take or pay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials, including industrial gases and natural gas, consistent with customary industry practice. These also include PPGs commitment to purchase electricity and steam from the RS Cogen joint venture discussed in Note 5, Investments, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. See Note 7, Debt and Bank Credit Agreements and Leases, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit, letters of credit, guarantees, and debt covenants. In addition to the amounts available under the lines of credit, the Company may issue up to $500 million aggregate principal amount of debt securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July 1999. 22 2003 Annual Report and Form 10 K PPG Industries, Inc. Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Companys off balance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations disclosed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in Note 7, Debt and Bank Credit Arrangements and Leases, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Estimates Management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes under Item 8 of this Form 10 K and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate. We believe that the most critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements relate to accounting for contingencies, under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated, and to accounting for pensions, other postretirement benefits, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies. Contingencies, by their nature, relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss. The most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable, environmental remediation, pending litigation against the Company and the resolution of matters related to open tax years. For more information on these matters, see Note 3, Working Capital Detail, Note 11, Income Taxes and Note 13, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works. To accomplish this, extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, turnover, medical costs and discount rates. These assumptions are reviewed annually. See Note 12, Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for information on these plans and the assumptions used. As discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K, the Company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying values. Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows. Based on this testing, none of our goodwill was impaired as of Dec. 31, 2003; however, the fair value of our fiber glass business declined during 2003. As a result, the related goodwill of $47 million is at risk in 2004 for impairment should our projected recovery in this business not occur. As part of our ongoing financial reporting process, a collaborative effort is undertaken involving PPG managers with functional responsibility for financial, credit, environmental, legal, tax and benefit matters and outside advisors such as consultants, engineers, lawyers and actuaries. The results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments on these contingencies and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements. We believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K related to these contingencies, pensions, other postretirement benefits, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate PPG management, although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates. Currency During 2003, the U.S. dollar weakened against the currencies of most of the countries in which PPG operates, most notably against the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and the Canadian dollar. The effects of translating the net assets of our operations denominated in non U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar increased consolidated net assets by $328 million. In addition, the weak U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on 2003 pretax earnings of approximately $50 million compared to 2002. The Euro and the British Pound Sterling strengthened against the U.S. dollar 18% and 11%, respectively, during 2002. The effects of translating the net assets and net earnings of our operations denominated in these currencies to the U.S. dollar increased consolidated net assets by approximately $140 million but did not have a significant impact on the results of operations. This was offset, in part, by the continued devaluation of the Argentine peso, which reduced our net investment in Argentina by $39 million to a total of $29 million as of Dec. 31, 2002. Any reduction in the value of these net assets resulting from a further devaluation of the Argentine peso will result in a direct charge to the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of shareholders equity. Research and Development Innovation and technology have been a hallmark of our Companys success throughout its history. Research and development costs totaled over 3% of sales in each of the past three years, representing a level of expenditure that we expect to continue in 2004. These costs include technology driven improvements to our manufacturing processes and customer technical service, as well as the costs of developing new products. Because of our broad array of products and customers, we are not materially dependent upon any single technology platform. Forward Looking Statements The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made 2003 Annual Report and Form 10 K PPG Industries, Inc. 23 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis by or on behalf of the Company. Managements Discussion and Analysis and other sections of this Annual Report contain forward looking statements that reflect the Companys current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward looking statements are identified by the use of the words aim, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate and other expressions that indicate future events and trends. Any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the SEC. Also, note the following cautionary statements. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the Companys forward looking statements. Among these factors are increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors, fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials, the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, economic and political conditions in international markets, the ability to penetrate existing, developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets, which also depends on economic and political conditions, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates, and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation, including litigation that could result if PPGs Settlement Agreement for asbestos claims does not become effective. Further, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, while the list of factors presented here is considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward looking statements. The consequences of material differences in the results as compared to those anticipated in the forward looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, operations or liquidity. 24 2003 Annual Report and Form 10 K PPG Industries, Inc. Table of Contents Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk PPG is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, natural gas prices and PPGs stock price arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business. The Company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce this market risk. A detailed description of these exposures and the Companys risk management policies are provided in Note 9, Derivative Financial Instruments, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The following disclosures summarize PPGs exposure to market risks and information regarding the use and fair value of derivatives employed to manage our exposure to such risks. Quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonable unfavorable changes in market rates can impact PPGs financial results, cash flows and financial condition. Foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2003 and 2002 were used to hedge PPGs exposure to foreign currency transaction and translation risk. The fair value of these contracts was an asset of $0.2 million and $1 million as of Dec. 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The potential reduction in PPGs earnings resulting from adverse changes in the exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for European currencies and 20% for Asian and South American currencies would have totaled approximately $0.2 million and $1 million as of Dec.31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. PPG had non U.S. dollar denominated debt of $28 million and $317 million as of Dec. 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The significant decrease in the debt levels is attributable to the Companys ongoing efforts to reduce overall debt levels, by deploying a portion of its operating cash flows for this purpose. A weakening of the U.S. dollar by 10% against European currencies and by 20% against Asian and South American currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately $7 million and $46 million as of Dec. 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of PPGs interest rate risk and, as of Dec. 31, 2003 and 2002, the fair value of the interest rate swaps was an asset of $9 million and $23 million, respectively. The fair value of these swaps would have decreased by $10 million and $7 million as of Dec.31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, if variable interest rates increased by 10%. A 10% increase in interest rates in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in Asia and South America would have affected PPGs variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense by approximately $1 million and $3 million as of Dec. 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the Companys fixed rate debt by approximately $40 million and $53 million as of Dec. 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Such changes would not have had a material effect on PPGs annual earnings or cash flows. The fair value of natural gas swap and option contracts was an asset of $3 million and $24 million as of Dec. 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These contracts were entered into to reduce PPGs exposure to rising prices of natural gas. A 10% reduction in the price of natural gas would result in a loss in the fair value of the underlying natural gas swap and option contracts outstanding as of Dec.31, 2003 and 2002 of approximately $3 million and $8 million, respectively. An equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the Companys exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute PPG stock into an asbestos settlement trust (see Note 9, Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 13, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K). In addition to the change in PPGs stock price, contributing to the change in fair value of this instrument was the increase in the number of shares purchased by the bank from 504,900 shares as of Dec. 31, 2002 to 904,900 shares as of Dec. 31, 2003. The fair value of this instrument as of Dec. 31, 2003 and 2002 was an asset of $15 million and $1 million, respectively. A 10% decrease in PPGs stock price would have reduced the value of this instrument by $6 million and $3 million, as of Dec. 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 2003 Annual Report and Form 10 K PPG Industries, Inc. 25 Table of Contents Financial and Operating Review
