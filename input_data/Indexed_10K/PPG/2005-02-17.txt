Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Performance in 2004 Compared with 2003 Overall Performance Our sales increased 9% to $9.5 billion in 2004 from $8.8 billion in 2003. Sales increased 7% due to improved volumes across all of our business segments and 3% due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation, primarily from our European operations. These sales increases were offset by a 1% decline due to lower selling prices. Gross profit increased $279 million while the gross profit percentage remained steady at 36.9% in 2004 and 2003. The sales volume increase, favorable impact of currency, improved manufacturing efficiencies, higher selling prices in our chemicals segment and lower pension and other postretirement benefit costs across all of our business segments increased our gross profit. Lower selling prices in our glass and coatings segments and higher natural gas, energy, raw material and labor costs lowered our gross profit. Selling, general and administrative expense, depreciation and research and development costs declined slightly as a percentage of sales to 25% despite increasing $142 million in 2004. These costs increased in part to support sales volume growth in 2004 and also because of the impact of foreign currency, inflation and our decision to begin expensing stock options in 2004. Interest expense was $17 million less in 2004 than in 2003 reflecting the year over year reduction in debt of $316 million. Other charges declined $30 million in 2004 due to a combination of lower environmental remediation, legal and workers compensation expenses and the absence of certain 2003 charges. Other earnings were $28 million higher in 2004 due primarily to higher earnings from our equity affiliates. The effective tax rate for 2004 was 30.29% compared to 34.76% for the full year 2003. The reduction in the rate for 2004 reflects the benefit of the subsidy offered pursuant to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Medicare Act), not being subject to tax, the continued improvement in the geographical mix of non U.S. earnings and the favorable resolution during 2004 of matters related to two open U.S. federal income tax years. Net income in 2004 totaled $683 million, an increase of $189 million over 2003, and earnings per share diluted increased $1.06 to $3.95 per share. Results of Business Segments Net sales Operating income (Millions) 2004 2003 2004 2003(1) Coatings $ 5,275 $ 4,835 $ 777 $ 719 Glass 2,204 2,150 169 71 Chemicals 2,034 1,771 291 228 (1) Operating income by segment for 2003 has been revised to reflect a change in the allocation method for certain pension and other postretirement benefit costs in 2004 (See Note 22 under Item 8 of this Form 10 K). Coatings sales increased $440 million or 9% in 2004. Sales increased 6% from improved volumes across all our coatings businesses and 4% due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation, primarily from our European operations. Sales declined 1% due to lower selling prices, principally in our automotive business. Operating income increased $58 million in 2004. Factors increasing operating income were the higher sales volume ($135 million) and the favorable effects of currency translation described above and improved manufacturing efficiencies of $20 million. Factors decreasing operating income were inflationary cost increases of $82 million and lower selling prices. Glass sales increased $54 million or 3% in 2004. Sales increased 6% from improved volumes primarily from our flat glass, fiber glass, and automotive original equipment businesses net of lower volumes in our automotive replacement glass business. Sales also increased 2% due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation, primarily from our European fiber glass operations. Sales declined 5% due to lower selling prices across all our glass businesses. Operating income in 2004 increased $98 million. Factors increasing operating income were improved manufacturing efficiencies of $110 million, higher sales volume ($53 million) described above, higher equity earnings and the gains on the sale/leaseback of precious metals of $19 million. The principal factor decreasing operating income was lower selling prices. Fiber Glass volumes were up 15% for the year, although pricing declined. With the shift of electronic printed wiring board production to Asia and the volume and pricing gains there, equity earnings from our joint venture serving that region grew in 2004. These factors combined with focused cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies to improve the operating performance of this business, as we continue to position it for future growth in profitability. 2004 Annual Report and Form 10 K n PPG Industries, Inc. 17 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis Chemicals sales increased $263 million or 15% in 2004. Sales increased 10% from improved volumes in our commodity and specialty businesses and 4% due to higher selling prices for our commodity products. Sales also increased 1% due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation, primarily from our European operations. Operating income increased $63 million in 2004. Factors increasing operating income were the higher selling prices for our commodity products and the higher sales volume ($73 million) described above, improved manufacturing efficiencies of $25 million and lower environmental expenses. Factors decreasing 2004 operating income were inflationary cost increases of $40 million and higher energy costs of $79 million. Market influences, such as fewer new drug approvals and increasing share of generic drugs, are putting pressure on the pharmaceutical industry resulting in a challenging environment for our fine chemicals business in the near term that includes significantly lower pricing. Other Significant Factors The Companys pension and other postretirement benefit costs for 2004 were $45 million lower than in 2003. This decrease reflects the market driven growth in pension plan assets that occurred in 2003, the impact of the $140 million in cash contributed to the pension plans by the Company in 2004 and the benefit of the subsidy offered pursuant to the Medicare Act, as discussed in Note 12 under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA 2004) was signed into law. Among its many provisions, the AJCA 2004 provides a limited opportunity in 2005 to repatriate the undistributed earnings of our non U.S. subsidiaries at a U.S. tax cost that may be lower than the normal tax cost on such distributions. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of this provision on PPG and are awaiting final guidance from the Internal Revenue Service to complete that evaluation; however, our current estimate is that the tax cost of any dividends we decide to pay in 2005 will not increase our effective tax rate significantly. We have included the estimated net impact of the remaining provisions of the AJCA 2004, including the U.S. manufacturing deduction, in our current estimate of the effective tax rate for 2005 of 31.5%. Outlook In 2004, the U.S. economy continued to gain momentum from the expansion that began in late 2003. Consumer confidence has been strong and has been buoyed by low interest rates, employment growth and improved U.S. equity markets that reached their highest level in nearly three years. Industrial production, which grew at a rate of 7% at the beginning of 2004, slowed in the second half of the year, but still achieved a solid 4.5% growth rate for the year. Industrial production is the economic metric that most positively correlates with our volume growth because it reflects activity in PPGs broad end use markets. The commercial construction sector grew at a 2% rate for the year but showed signs of further improvement during the second half of the year. For the full year, North American sales of light vehicles were up slightly as were European automotive sales. As the new year begins, most economists expect that the U.S. economy will continue to perform well in 2005 though growth may perhaps be at a slower pace. Inflation is expected to remain relatively low, despite rising energy costs and raw material prices, because of increasing productivity. Interest rates should remain at relatively low levels. The healthy U.S. economy should help to support overall global economic growth in 2005. Global competition combined with productivity improvements will keep overall inflation in check and sustain worldwide economic growth. Growth in the European economy will likely be adversely impacted by the strength of the Euro, which at the end of 2004 was near its all time high against the U.S. dollar. However, the strengthening economy of Eastern Europe may be a mitigating factor. The Asian economies are expected to continue to record relatively high growth rates, especially in China. This growth remains strong, yet tempered due to a variety of government efforts aimed at preventing the economy from overheating. Chinas infrastructure growth is expected to continue to impact the overall global economy via increased demand for basic goods and commodities. Additionally, China and other low labor cost countries will continue to put downward pressure on worldwide pricing of consumer goods. As was the case in 2004, we expect Chinas expansion to benefit our coatings, fiber glass and optical businesses, while requiring our glass and commodity chemicals businesses to continue their ongoing focus on reducing costs. In 2005, we will remain committed to our PPG Blueprint values of serving our customers, introducing new technologies and achieving operational excellence through our continuing focus on reducing costs. The prospect of favorable global economic conditions this year lead us to expect continued sales growth in 2005. Important cost issues in 2005 will continue to include pensions, other postretirement benefits, natural gas and raw materials. While we have consistently focused on reducing our costs, we continue to be challenged by higher costs for employee benefits, particularly pensions and medical. Prior to 2001, our pension income more than offset other postretirement benefit costs. In 2004, pension expense combined with other postretirement benefit costs were nearly $250 million. This cost increase translates to over $1.05 per share in lower earnings in 2004 compared with 2000. This increase in costs results from a combination of the decline in the market value of the Companys pension plans assets, due primarily to negative investment returns 2004 Annual Report and Form 10 K n PPG Industries, Inc. 18 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis in the equity markets during 2000 2002, a reduction in our expected future rate of return on pension plan assets, lower discount rate assumption and rising retiree medical costs, particularly for prescription drugs. The current low interest rate environment has continued and, in fact, the discount rate at Dec. 31, 2004, was approximately 25 basis points lower than at Dec. 31, 2003. This raises the present value of future benefit obligations and expense. Offsetting the negative impact of lower discount rates were the strong actual return on our U.S. plan assets of over 25% in 2003 and over 12% in 2004. Additionally, the benefit of the subsidy available under the Medicare Act reduced our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and resulted in a reduction of our other postretirement benefit cost in 2004 of $19 million. This benefit is expected to be approximately $25 million in 2005. Based on current estimates, including the benefit of this subsidy, our pension and other postretirement benefit costs for 2005 are expected to rise only slightly from the 2004 level. High natural gas costs in North America continue to be a drag on earnings. Changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the operating performance of our chemicals and glass segments. Each one dollar change in the price of natural gas per mmbtu (million British thermal units) would have a direct impact of approximately $60 million to $70 million on our annual operating costs. It is difficult to predict future natural gas prices, which continue to be high and volatile. In order to reduce the risks associated with volatile prices, we use a number of techniques, which include reducing consumption through improved manufacturing processes, switching to alternative fuels and hedging. We currently estimate our average cost for natural gas in the first quarter of 2005 will be approximately $6.30 per mmbtu, including the impact of hedges we have in place on approximately one third of our expected first quarter natural gas consumption. This estimate represents an increase of 12% over our first quarter 2004 cost of natural gas. In the second half of 2004, we began to see increases in the prices for raw materials used in our coatings businesses, as a result of the industrial expansion, supply/demand imbalance and increases in supplier costs for oil and other inputs. Year over year coatings raw material costs will rise at least $50 million in the first quarter of 2005 and are likely to continue to be higher for the remainder of 2005. We plan to combat the impact of these rising costs by seeking alternate supply sources, reformulating our products, improving our production processes and yields and raising our selling prices. These same factors, along with high capacity utilization, resulted in tighter supplies of chlor alkali products. This led to a sharp increase in ECU prices in the second half of 2004 which benefited our commodity chemicals business. ECU prices in the fourth quarter 2004 were up 31% versus the fourth quarter of 2003. We expect these tight supply/demand conditions in the market to continue at least through the first half of 2005. Our focus on our Blueprint values has enabled us to continue along our track of strong cash generation, as evidenced by the $3 billion in cash from operating activities over the 2002 2004 time period. We have continued to fund our portfolio of businesses and prudently manage capital spending while at the same time continuing our trend of increasing dividend payments to shareholders for 33 consecutive years and reducing our debt by over $1 billion over the past three years. Additionally, we repurchased $100 million of PPG common stock in 2004 and have announced plans to repurchase up to $500 million in PPG common stock by the end of 2005. We remain confident that PPG is well positioned to benefit from the expected worldwide economic growth in 2005. Accounting Standard Adopted in 2004 Effective Jan. 1, 2004, we adopted the fair value method of recording stock based compensation, as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, for stock options awarded to employees after the date of adoption and for previously issued stock options that were not vested as of Jan. 1, 2004 using the modified prospective transition method. The adoption increased Selling, general and administrative expense by $20 million ($13 million, aftertax, or $0.07 per share) for the year ended Dec. 31, 2004. This impact reflects the fact that beginning in 2004 stock option grants under the PPG Stock Plan will vest three years after the date of grant. Previously, original grants of stock options under this plan vested after one year. Additionally, under the modified prospective transition method we recorded a deferred tax asset of $8 million and a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital equal to the deferred tax benefit that would have been recognized in 2003 had compensation expense been recorded under the fair value provisions of SFAS No. 123 for options outstanding at the date of adoption but not fully vested. Accounting Standards to be Adopted in Future Years In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS No. 151 requires the exclusion of certain costs from inventories and the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventories to be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of this Statement are effective for costs incurred after Dec. 31, 2005. We are currently in the process of evaluating the effect the adoption of this standard will have on PPG; however we do not expect it to have a material effect on PPGs consolidated results of operations or financial position. In December 2004, the FASB issued a revision to SFAS No. 123, Share Based Payments which now 2004 Annual Report and Form 10 K n PPG Industries, Inc. 19 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis requires that stock options be expensed based on their fair value. As discussed above, PPG began expensing stock options effective Jan. 1, 2004, and consequently our adoption of this revised Statement in 2005 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys results of operations or financial position. Performance in 2003 Compared with 2002 Overall Performance Our sales increased 9% to $8.8 billion in 2003 from $8.1 billion in 2002. Sales increased 4% due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation, primarily from our European operations, 3% due to improved volumes across all of our business segments and 2% due to higher selling prices, primarily in our chemicals segment. The gross profit percentage decreased slightly to 36.9% in 2003 from 37.2% in 2002. Higher pension and postretirement medical costs across all of our business segments, higher energy costs in our glass and chemicals segments and inflationary cost increases were offset by higher selling prices in our chemicals segment and the benefits realized from improved manufacturing efficiencies in our coatings and glass segments. Net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share diluted for 2003 and 2002 are presented in the following table along with the more significant charges that were included in those amounts. 2003 2002 (Millions, except pershare amounts) Net income Earnings per share diluted Net (loss) income (Loss) earnings per share diluted As reported $494 $2.89 $(69) $(0.41) Included in net income (loss) are the following significant charges, net of tax: Asbestos settlement net (See Note 13) 23 0.14 484 2.85 Restructuring and other related activities(See Note 2) 2 0.01 52 0.31 Cumulative effect of accounting change(See Note 1) 6 0.03 9 0.05 The notes referenced in the above table are found under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Net income for 2003 compared to 2002 was $563 million higher. The significant charges in the table above account for $514 million of this change. The remaining $49 million increase in net income was due to a combination of factors. The factors causing 2003 net income to be higher were higher selling prices in our chemicals segment, higher sales volumes across all of our business segments, the favorable effects of foreign currency translation, primarily from our European operations, improved manufacturing efficiencies and lower overhead costs in our coatings and glass segments, the gain on the sale of certain non strategic assets, including marketable securities, and lower interest expense due to lower debt levels in 2003. Higher pension and postretirement medical costs across all of our business segments, higher energy costs in our glass and chemicals segments and the negative effects of inflation were factors reducing 2003 net income. Results of Business Segments Net sales Operating income(1) (Millions) 2003 2002 2003 2002 Coatings $ 4,835 $ 4,482 $ 719 $ 609 Glass 2,150 2,071 71 145 Chemicals 1,771 1,514 228 124 (1) Operating income by segment has been revised to reflect a change in the allocation method for certain pension and other postretirement benefit costs in 2004 (See Note 22 under Item 8 of this Form 10 K). Coatings sales increased $353 million or 8% in 2003. Sales increased 6% due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation, primarily from our European operations and 2% from improved volumes primarily from our aerospace, architectural, automotive and industrial businesses. Lower pricing in our automotive business offset higher pricing in our other coatings businesses. Operating income increased $110 million in 2003. Operating income in 2003 and 2002 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of $2 million and $73 million, respectively. Factors increasing operating income were lower restructuring costs in 2003, the higher sales volumes described above, improved manufacturing efficiencies, the favorable effects of foreign currency translation and lower overhead costs. Factors decreasing operating income were inflationary cost increases and higher pension and postretirement medical costs. Glass sales increased $79 million or 4% in 2003. Sales increased 4% from improved volumes primarily from our automotive original equipment, automotive replacement glass and flat glass businesses, net of lower volumes from our fiber glass business. Sales also increased 3% due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation, primarily from our European fiber glass operations. These sales increases were offset by a 3% decline due to lower selling prices from our automotive original equipment, automotive replacement glass and fiber glass businesses. Operating income decreased $74 million in 2003. Operating income in 2003 and 2002 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of $2 million and $1 million, respectively. Factors decreasing operating income were lower selling prices of $68 million, higher pension and postretirement medical costs of $67 million and higher energy costs of $30 million. Factors increasing operating income in 2003 by $91 million were the improved manufacturing efficiencies, lower overhead costs, the higher sales volumes described above and the favorable effects of foreign currency translation. Our fiber glass business continued to experience significant sales and earnings declines principally as a result of global industry overcapacity, which has led to substantially lower pricing. Chemicals sales increased $257 million or 17% in 2003. Sales increased 13% from higher selling prices for 2004 Annual Report and Form 10 K n PPG Industries, Inc. 20 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis our commodity products. Sales also increased 3% due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation, primarily from our European operations and 1% from higher optical, fine and silicas products volumes, net of lower commodity volumes. Operating income increased $104 million in 2003. Operating income in 2002 included pretax restructuring and other related costs of $1 million. Higher commodity product pricing in 2003 increased operating earnings by $200 million while higher energy and pension and postretirement medical costs decreased operating earnings by $70 million and $22 million, respectively. Other Significant Factors The Companys pretax earnings in 2003 included net periodic pension expense of $176 million compared to $54 million in 2002. The increase in pension costs is due primarily to a decrease in the market value of pension plan assets through the end of 2002, a reduction in the expected return on plan assets assumption for 2003 and the amortization of accumulated actuarial losses. In addition, the cost of other postretirement benefits in 2003 was $115 million compared to $91 million in 2002. On a combined basis, the increase in net periodic benefit cost of $146 million was $44 million for the coatings segment, $67 million for the glass segment, $22 million for the chemicals segment and $13 million for corporate. Although the majority of the Companys defined benefit plans continued to be underfunded on an accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) basis as of Dec. 31, 2003, the underfunded amount was lower, which resulted in an increase in shareholders equity through a decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive income of $147 million, aftertax. See Note 12, Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for additional information. The effective tax rate for 2003 was 34.76%. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, including Environmental Matters PPG is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against others, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. In a suit filed by Marvin Windows and Doors, PPG has appealed the unfavorable judgment awarded by a federal jury. The appeals court heard the parties arguments on June 9, 2003, but has not yet rendered its decision. PPG believes it has meritorious defenses to the plaintiffs claims and has reasonable prospects of prevailing on appeal. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings of this Form 10 K and Note 13, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for an expanded description of this case and certain other lawsuits, including the proposed PPG Settlement Arrangement for asbestos claims announced on May 14, 2002. As discussed in Item 3 and Note 13, although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable, management believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving PPG, including asbestos related claims in the event the PPG Settlement Arrangement described in Note 13 does not become effective, will not have a material effect on PPGs consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. It is PPGs policy to accrue expenses for environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted. As of Dec. 31, 2004 and 2003, PPG had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling $81 million and $92 million, respectively. Pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2004, 2003 and 2002 totaled $15 million, $21 million and $15 million, respectively, and are included in Other charges in the accompanying statement of income. Cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated $26 million, $16 million and $22 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In addition to the amounts currently reserved, the Company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as $200 million to $400 million, which range is unchanged from the prior year end. Such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence. Management anticipates that the resolution of the Companys environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time. Over the past 10 years the pretax charges against income have ranged between $10 million and $49 million per year. We anticipate that charges against income in 2005 will be within that range. It is possible, however, that technological, regulatory and enforcement developments, the results of environmental studies and other factors could alter this expectation. See Note 13, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for an expanded description of certain of these environmental contingencies. In managements opinion, the Company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the Companys environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on PPGs financial position or liquidity. In June 2003, our partner in a fiber glass joint venture in South America filed for bankruptcy. Upon resolution of the bankruptcy proceedings, the partners ownership interest may transfer to one of its senior secured creditors or be sold. While PPG expects operations at the joint venture to continue, the Company is currently evaluating its options with respect to this venture, which may include the sale or liquidation of the venture. Should liquidation occur, PPGs exposure to loss would be 2004 Annual Report and Form 10 K n PPG Industries, Inc. 21 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis limited to $12 million, which includes a combination of the Companys investment, outstanding receivables and a loan guarantee related to this venture. Impact of Inflation In 2004, the combined impact of lower overall selling prices and higher production costs, due to the negative effects of inflation, including the impact of higher raw material and labor costs across all our segments and higher energy costs in our glass and chemicals segments, was only partially offset through improved manufacturing efficiencies. In 2003, the increase in production costs due to the negative effects of inflation, including the impact of higher energy costs in our glass and chemicals segments, was offset by the impact of higher selling prices in our chemicals segment and the improved manufacturing efficiencies in our coatings and glass segments. In 2002, the decline in selling prices and the negative effects of inflation on our production costs were not fully recovered through improved manufacturing efficiencies across all of our businesses and lower raw material and natural gas costs. We expect the negative impact of inflation on our production costs to be more significant in 2005 than in 2004, primarily because of the expected increases in our coatings raw material costs. We anticipate that the combination of continuing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and an overall increase in our selling prices in 2005 will offset the negative impact of inflation, but achieving that result will be a challenge. Liquidity and Capital Resources During the past three years, we had sufficient financial resources to meet our operating requirements, to fund our capital spending, share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to our shareholders. Cash from operating activities was $1,018 million, $1,123 million and $872 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Capital spending was $311 million, $220 million and $260 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. This spending related to modernization and productivity improvements, expansion of existing businesses, environmental control projects and business acquisitions, which amounted to $67 million, $3 million and $22 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Capital spending, excluding acquisitions, is expected to be approximately $350 million during 2005. We periodically review our array of businesses in relation to our overall strategic and performance objectives. As part of this review, we may acquire or divest of certain businesses or enter into joint ventures with other companies. During 2005, we anticipate that any acquisitions would be funded through a combination of cash generated from operations or from the sale of other businesses and, to a lesser extent, external funding sources or the issuance of stock. Dividends paid to shareholders totaled $307 million, $294 million and $287 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. PPG has paid uninterrupted dividends since 1899, and 2004 marked the 33rd consecutive year of increased dividend payments to shareholders. Over time, our goal is to sustain our dividends at approximately one third of our earnings per share. During 2004, the Company repurchased 1.5 million shares of PPG common stock at a cost of $100 million under previously authorized share repurchase programs. During 2003 and 2002, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock. At Dec. 31, 2004, there are 9.4 million shares of common stock authorized for repurchase remaining under a program approved in October 2000. In January 2005, the Company announced plans to repurchase up to $500 million of PPG common stock by year end 2005 under this program. While we have had no mandatory funding contribution required under Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation or Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations for our U.S. pension plans, we chose to make voluntary contributions of $100 million in 2004 and $22 million in 2003. These pension contributions will allow the Company more flexibility in determining both the timing and amounts of future mandatory contributions under the complex ERISA and IRS pension funding regulations. Based on our current estimate under existing U.S. pension funding regulations, with available funding credits, there will be no mandatory pension funding requirement until 2008 at the earliest even if our plan assets remain at December 2004 levels. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, we made contributions to our non U.S. pension plans totaling $40 million, $41 million and $20 million, respectively. We expect to make mandatory contributions to our non U.S. plans in 2005 of approximately $20 million. During 2004, after funding the matters described above, we were able to repay over $350 million of debt. Consequently, the ratio of total debt, including capital leases, to total debt and equity declined to 27% at Dec. 31, 2004 from 36% at Dec. 31, 2003. We were also able to increase our cash by about $200 million in 2004. The Company has invested this cash on a short term basis in high credit quality cash equivalents. Cash from operations and the Companys debt capacity are expected to continue to be sufficient to fund capital spending, share repurchases, dividend payments, contributions to pension plans, amounts due under the proposed asbestos settlement and operating requirements, including PPGs significant contractual obligations, which 2004 Annual Report and Form 10 K n PPG Industries, Inc. 22 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis are presented in the following table along with amounts due under the proposed asbestos settlement: Obligations Due In: (Millions) Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Contractual Obligations Long term debt $ 1,311 $ 130 $ 165 $ 298 $ 718 Capital lease obligations 4 1 2 1 Operating leases 267 75 103 55 34 Unconditional purchase obligations 807 165 154 85 403 Total $ 2,389 $ 371 $ 424 $ 439 $ 1,155 Asbestos Settlement(1) Aggregate cash payments $ 998 $ 264 $ 158 $ 66 $ 510 PPG stock and other 140 140 Total $ 1,138 $ 404 $ 158 $ 66 $ 510 (1) We have recorded an obligation equal to the net present value of the aggregate cash payments, along with the PPG stock and other assets to be contributed to the Asbestos Settlement Trust. However, PPG has no obligation to pay any amounts under this settlement until the Effective Date, as more fully discussed in Note 13, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The unconditional purchase commitments are principally take or pay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials, including industrial gases and natural gas, consistent with customary industry practice. These also include PPGs commitment to purchase electricity and steam from the RS Cogen joint venture discussed in Note 5, Investments, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. See Note 7, Debt and Bank Credit Agreements and Leases, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit, letters of credit, guarantees, and debt covenants. In addition to the amounts available under the lines of credit, the Company may issue up to $500 million aggregate principal amount of debt securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in July 1999. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Companys off balance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations disclosed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in Note 7, Debt and Bank Credit Arrangements and Leases, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Estimates Management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under Item 8 of this Form 10 K and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate. We believe that the most critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements relate to accounting for contingencies, under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated, and to accounting for pensions, other postretirement benefits, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies. Contingencies, by their nature, relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss. The most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable, environmental remediation, pending litigation against the Company and the resolution of matters related to open tax years. For more information on these matters, see Note 3, Working Capital Detail, Note 11, Income Taxes and Note 13, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works. To accomplish this, extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, turnover, medical costs and discount rates. These assumptions are reviewed annually. See Note 12, Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for information on these plans and the assumptions used. The discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments, evaluating market interest rate indices and using an outside advisor to determine the yield on a diversified portfolio of available high quality fixed income securities that matches our projected future benefit payments. The discount rate assumption for 2005 is 6.0% for our U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. A reduction in the discount rate of 50 basis points, with all other assumptions held constant, would increase 2005 net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately $9 million and $6 million, respectively. The expected return on plan assets assumption used in accounting for our pension plans is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future long term investment returns. For 2004, the return on plan assets assumption for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans was 8.5%. We expect to use the same assumption for 2005. A reduction in the rate of return of 50 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would increase 2005 net periodic pension expense by approximately $11 million. As discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K, the 2004 Annual Report and Form 10 K n PPG Industries, Inc. 23 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis Company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying values. Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows. Based on this testing, none of our goodwill was impaired as of Dec. 31, 2004; however the fair value of our fine chemicals business declined during 2004. As a result, some or all of the related goodwill of $28 million is at risk in 2005 for impairment should our projected growth in the business not occur. The excess of the fair value over the carrying value of our fiber glass business grew during 2004. As part of our ongoing financial reporting process, a collaborative effort is undertaken involving PPG managers with functional responsibility for financial, credit, environmental, legal, tax and benefit matters and outside advisors such as consultants, engineers, lawyers and actuaries. The results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments on these contingencies and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements. We believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K related to these contingencies, pensions, other postretirement benefits, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate PPG management, although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates. Currency During 2004 and 2003, the U.S. dollar weakened against the currencies of most of the countries in which PPG operates, most notably against the euro, the British pound sterling and the Canadian dollar. The effects of translating the net assets of our operations denominated in non U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar increased consolidated net assets by $180 million and $328 million for the years ended Dec. 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In addition, the weaker U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on 2004 and 2003 pretax earnings of approximately $35 million and $50 million, respectively. The euro and the British pound sterling strengthened against the U.S. dollar by 18% and 11%, respectively, during 2002. The effects of translating the net assets and net earnings of our operations denominated in these currencies to the U.S. dollar increased consolidated net assets by approximately $140 million but did not have a significant impact on the results of operations. This was offset, in part, by the continued devaluation of the Argentine peso, which reduced our net investment in Argentina by $39 million. Research and Development Innovation and technology have been a hallmark of our Companys success throughout its history. Research and development costs totaled over 3% of sales in each of the past three years, representing a level of expenditure that we expect to continue in 2005. These costs include technology driven improvements to our manufacturing processes and customer technical service, as well as the costs of developing new products. Because of our broad array of products and customers, we are not materially dependent upon any single technology platform. Forward Looking Statements The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. Managements Discussion and Analysis and other sections of this Annual Report contain forward looking statements that reflect the Companys current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward looking statements are identified by the use of the words aim, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate and other expressions that indicate future events and trends. Any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also, note the following cautionary statements. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the Companys forward looking statements. Such factors include increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors, fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials, the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, economic and political conditions in international markets, the ability to penetrate existing, developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets, which also depends on economic and political conditions, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates, and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation, including litigation that could result if PPGs Settlement Agreement for asbestos claims does not become effective. However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, while the list of factors presented here is considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward looking statements. 2004 Annual Report and Form 10 K n PPG Industries, Inc. 24 Table of Contents Consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forward looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, operations or liquidity. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk PPG is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, natural gas prices and PPGs stock price arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business. The Company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce this market risk. A detailed description of these exposures and the Companys risk management policies are provided in Note 9, Derivative Financial Instruments, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The following disclosures summarize PPGs exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage our exposure to such risks. Quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonable, unfavorable changes in market rates can impact PPGs financial results, cash flows and financial condition. Foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2004 and 2003 were used to hedge PPGs exposure to foreign currency transaction and translation risk. The fair value of these contracts as of Dec. 31, 2004 and 2003 was not material. The potential reduction in PPGs earnings resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for European currencies and 20% for Asian and South American currencies would also not have been material. PPG had non U.S. dollar denominated debt of $44 million and $28 million outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. A weakening of the U.S. dollar by 10% against European currencies and by 20% against Asian and South American currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately $11 million and $7 million as of Dec. 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of PPGs interest rate risk and, as of Dec. 31, 2004 and 2003, the fair value of the interest rate swaps in place was an asset of $4 million and $9 million, respectively. The fair value of these swaps would have decreased by $9 million and $10 million as of Dec. 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, if variable interest rates increased by 10%. A 10% increase in interest rates in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in Asia and South America would have affected PPGs variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense by approximately $2 million and $1 million as of Dec. 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the Companys fixed rate debt by approximately $36 million and $40 million as of Dec. 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Such changes would not have had a material effect on PPGs annual earnings or cash flows. The fair value of natural gas swap contracts in place was a liability of $2 million and an asset of $3 million as of Dec. 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These contracts were entered into to reduce PPGs exposure to rising prices of natural gas. A 10% reduction in the price of natural gas would result in a loss in the fair value of the underlying natural gas swap contracts outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2004 and 2003 of approximately $1 million and $3 million, respectively. An equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the Companys exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute PPG stock into an asbestos settlement trust (see Note 9, Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 13, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K). The fair value of this instrument as of Dec. 31, 2004 and 2003 was an asset of $19 million and $15 million, respectively. A 10% decrease in PPGs stock price would have reduced the value of this instrument by $6 million, as of Dec. 31, 2004 and 2003. 2004 Annual Report and Form 10 K n PPG Industries, Inc. 25 Table of Contents Financial and Operating Review
