Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Performance in 2006 compared with 2005 Performance Overview Our sales increased 8% to $11.0 billion in 2006 compared to $10.2 billion in 2005. Sales increased 4% due to the impact of acquisitions, 2% due to increased volumes, and 2% due to increased selling prices. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased slightly to 63.7% compared to 63.5% in 2005. Selling, general and administrative expense increased slightly as a percentage of sales to 17.9% compared to 17.4% in 2005. These costs increased primarily due to higher expenses related to store expansions in our architectural coatings operating segment and increased advertising to promote growth in our optical products operating segment. Other charges decreased $81 million in 2006. Other charges in 2006 included pretax charges of $185 million for estimated environmental remediation costs at sites in New Jersey and $42 million for legal settlements offset in part by pretax earnings of $44 million for insurance recoveries related to the Marvin legal settlement and to Hurricane Rita. Other charges in 2005 included pretax charges of $132 million related to the Marvin legal settlement net of related insurance recoveries of $18 million, $61 million for the federal glass class action antitrust legal settlement, $34 million of direct costs related to the impact of hurricanes Rita and Katrina, $27 million for an asset impairment charge in our fine chemicals operating segment and $19 million for debt refinancing costs. Other earnings increased $30 million in 2006 due to higher equity earnings, primarily from our Asian fiber glass joint ventures, and higher royalty income. Net income and earnings per share assuming dilution for 2006 were $711 million and $4.27, respectively, compared to $596 million and $3.49, respectively, for 2005. Net income in 2006 included aftertax charges of $106 million, or 64 cents a share, for estimated environmental remediation costs at sites in New Jersey and Louisiana in the third quarter; $26 million, or 15 cents a share, for legal settlements; $23 million, or 14 cents a share for business restructuring; $17 million, or 10 cents a share, to reflect the net increase in the current value of the Companys obligation relating to asbestos claims under the PPG Settlement Arrangement; and aftertax earnings of $24 million, or 14 cents a share for insurance recoveries. Net income in 2005 included aftertax charges of $117 million, or 68 cents a share for legal settlements net of insurance; $21 million, or 12 cents a share for direct costs related to the impact of hurricanes Katrina and Rita; $17 million, or 10 cents a share, related to an asset impairment charge related to our fine chemicals operating segment; $12 million, or 7 cents a share, for debt refinancing cost; and $13 million, or 8 cents a share, to reflect the net increase in the current 2006 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 19 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis value of the Companys obligation relating to asbestos claims under the PPG Settlement Arrangement. The legal settlements net of insurance included aftertax charges of $80 million for the Marvin legal settlement, net of insurance recoveries of $11 million, and $37 million for the impact of the federal glass class action antitrust legal settlement. Results of Reportable Business Segments Net sales Segment income (Millions) 2006 2005 2006 2005 Industrial Coatings $ 3,236 $ 2,921 $ 349 $ 284 Performance and Applied Coatings 3,088 2,668 514 464 Optical and Specialty Materials 1,001 867 223 158 Commodity Chemicals 1,483 1,531 285 313 Glass 2,229 2,214 148 123 Industrial Coatings sales increased $315 million or 11% in 2006. Sales increased 4% due to acquisitions, 4% due to increased volumes in the automotive, industrial and packaging coatings operating segments, 2% due to higher selling prices, particularly in the industrial and packaging coatings businesses and 1% due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation. Segment income increased $65 million in 2006. The increase in segment income was primarily due to the impact of increased sales volume, lower overhead and manufacturing costs, and the impact of acquisitions. Segment income was reduced by the adverse impact of inflation, which was substantially offset by higher selling prices. Performance and Applied Coatings sales increased $420 million or 16% in 2006. Sales increased 8% due to acquisitions, 4% due to higher selling prices in the refinish, aerospace and architectural coatings operating segments, 3% due to increased volumes in our aerospace and architectural coatings businesses and 1% due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation. Segment income increased $50 million in 2006. The increase in segment income was primarily due to the impact of increased sales volume and higher selling prices, which more than offset the impact of inflation. Segment income was reduced by increased overhead costs to support growth in our architectural coatings business. Optical and Specialty Materials sales increased $134 million or 15% in 2006. Sales increased 10% due to higher volumes, particularly in optical products and fine chemicals and 5% due to acquisitions in our optical products business. Segment income increased $65 million in 2006. The absence of the 2005 charge for an asset impairment in our fine chemicals business increased segment income by $27 million. The remaining $38 million increase in segment income was primarily due to increased volumes, lower manufacturing costs, and the absence of the 2005 hurricane costs of $3 million, net of 2006 insurance recoveries, which were only partially offset by increased overhead costs in our optical products business to support growth and the negative impact of inflation. Commodity Chemicals sales decreased $48 million or 3% in 2006. Sales decreased 4% due to lower chlor alkali volumes and increased 1% due to higher selling prices. Segment income decreased $28 million in 2006. The year over year decline in segment income was due primarily to lower sales volumes and higher manufacturing costs associated with reduced production levels. The absence of the 2005 charges for direct costs related to hurricanes increased segment income by $29 million. The impact of higher selling prices; lower inflation, primarily natural gas costs, and an insurance recovery of $10 million related to the 2005 hurricane losses also increased segment income in 2006. Our fourth quarter chlor alkali sales volumes and earnings were negatively impacted by production outages at several customers over the last two months of 2006. It is uncertain when some of these customers will return to a normal level of production which may impact the sales and earnings of our chlor alkali business in early 2007. Glass sales increased $15 million or 1% in 2006. Sales increased 1% due to improved volumes resulting from a combination of organic growth and an acquisition. A slight positive impact on sales due to foreign currency translation offset a slight decline in pricing. Volumes increased in the performance glazings, automotive replacement glass and services and fiber glass businesses. Automotive OEM glass volume declined during 2006. Pricing was also up in performance glazings, but declined in the other glass businesses. Segment income increased $25 million in 2006. This increase in segment income was primarily the result of higher equity earnings from our Asian fiber glass joint ventures, higher royalty income and lower manufacturing and natural gas costs, which more than offset the negative impacts of higher inflation, lower margin mix of sales and reduced selling prices. Our fiber glass operating segment made progress during 2006 in achieving our multi year plan to improve profitability and cash flow. A transformation of our supply chain, which includes production of a more focused product mix at each manufacturing plant, manufacturing cost reduction initiatives and improved equity earnings from our Asian joint ventures are the primary focus and represent the critical success factors in this plan. During 2006, our new joint venture in China started producing high labor content fiber glass reinforcement products, which will allow us to refocus our U.S. production capacity on higher margin, direct process products. The 2006 earnings improvement by our fiber glass operating segment accounted for the bulk of the 2006 improvement in the Glass reportable business segment income. 20 2006 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis The 2006 earnings of our automotive OEM glass operating segment declined year over year by $9 million, following a decline of $30 million in 2005. Significant structural changes continue to occur in the North American automotive industry, including the loss of U.S. market share by General Motors, Ford and Daimler Chrysler. This has created a challenging and competitive environment for all suppliers to the domestic OEMs, including our operating segment. In 2007, the automotive OEM glass business will continue to focus on cost reduction, developing new, value added products and increasing sales volume. We have an ongoing process that includes a review of our array of operating segments in relation to our overall strategic and performance objectives. In 2007, this process will include considering alternatives for maximizing shareholder value. These alternatives may include acquisitions, restructure, forming strategic alliances and divestiture. As part of this process, we are initially focused on the automotive OEM glass, automotive replacement glass and services and fine chemicals operating segments. To that end, we have engaged outside advisors to assist us in considering our alternatives, including the potential sale of one or more of these operating segments. See Note 23, Reportable Business Segment Information, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further information related to our operating segments and reportable business segments. Other Significant Factors The effective tax rate for 2006 was 26.2% compared to 29.8% for 2005. The 2006 rate includes the benefit of a tax refund from Canada resulting from the favorable resolution of a tax dispute dating back to 1997 and a tax benefit related to the settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of our tax returns for the years 2001 2003. In the aggregate, these benefits reduced 2006 income tax expense by $39 million. The 2006 effective tax rate includes a tax benefit of 36% on the charge for business restructuring and a tax benefit of 39% on the third quarter environmental remediation charge for sites in New Jersey and Louisiana, on the charges for legal settlements, and on the adjustment to increase the current value of the Companys obligation relating to asbestos claims under the PPG Settlement Arrangement, as discussed in Note 14, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Income tax expense of 39% was recognized on certain insurance recoveries, and income tax expense of 31.5% was recognized on the remaining pretax earnings. The 2005 effective tax rate included a tax benefit of 39% on the charge for the Marvin legal settlement net of insurance recoveries, the settlement of the federal glass class action antitrust case, the asset impairment charge related to our fine chemicals operating segment, the charge for debt refinancing costs and the adjustment to increase the current value of the Companys obligation relating to asbestos claims under the PPG Settlement Arrangement. The 2005 effective tax rate also included tax expense of $9 million related to dividends repatriated under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA 2004) and tax expense of 31.0% on the remaining pretax earnings. Our current estimate of the effective tax rate for 2007 is 31.5%. Outlook In 2006, growth slowed in the U.S. and overall North American economy during the year. This growth rate decelerated more in the second half of the year due, in part, to both slower U.S. residential construction and automobile production. Overall industrial production increased 3% for the year despite a 3% decrease in automotive production. Industrial production remains the economic metric that most positively correlates with our organic volume growth because it reflects activity in PPGs broad end use markets. The U.S. commercial construction sector continued to grow throughout the year recording growth of more than 15%, a rate well above recent historical trends and overall U.S. GDP growth. The European economy grew at a fairly consistent rate throughout the year and overall industrial activity in most emerging regions of the world remained robust. Overall inflation rates remained fairly modest as labor rates were fairly flat through most of the world. Energy prices and other basic raw material costs remained high from an historical perspective, with some costs increasing slightly while others declined during the year. Natural gas costs in the U.S. declined from all time record highs experienced at the end of 2005 which were due, in part, to supply disruptions resulting from the U.S. hurricanes, while oil costs remained at high levels through year end. The European economy grew at a rate of about 3% in 2006. The economic growth was fueled primarily by higher industrial production and lower unemployment rates, the latter of which aided consumer spending. European automotive production rose by about 3%, as increases in Eastern Europe offset a slight decline in Western Europe. Overall industrial production expanded by about 1%. The Asian economy continued to post very high growth relative to historical global trends. Industrial production, which includes vehicle production among other sub categories, grew at more than 15% in China. Entering 2007, many economists are predicting slower North American growth in the first half of the year compared with 2006. Inflation will likely remain fairly 2006 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 21 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis modest, as globalization and productivity are expected to minimize labor cost inflation. Additionally, a slower U.S. economy would reduce demand for both energy and other commodity materials, which could in turn impact costs favorably. We currently expect interest rates in the U.S. to decline at some point in 2007, but they may increase further in the European community. Overall global economic growth is expected to continue despite the moderation in the North American economy. The global growth will continue to be stimulated by growth in the emerging regions of the world including China, India and Eastern Europe. Western Europe is expected to continue to expand, but it may be at lower levels than 2006 due, in part, to a stronger Euro and higher interest rates. The strong growth in the emerging regions continues a trend that has been prevalent for several years. Economic growth in China will be sustained by both continued infrastructure expansion and unrelenting growth in its industrial base. The infrastructure expansion will likely be helped by preparations for the 2008 Olympics which will be held in China. Global companies such as PPG will continue to benefit by this overall global expansion, as evidenced in 2006 where PPGs non U.S. and non Canadian operations grew organically by almost 10%. As this globalization increases, customers seek both global solutions and global servicing. In 2007, we expect continued cost pressures including certain raw materials, transportation and healthcare costs. We remain focused on offsetting these cost pressures through aggressive sourcing initiatives combined with manufacturing cost improvements, productivity and selling price increases. Our pension and post retirement benefit costs totaled $271 million in 2006 reflecting an increase of $37 million from 2005. These costs remain well above their 2000 level as a result of subpar investment returns over this time period, particularly the negative investment returns in the equity market in 2001 and 2002, a reduction in our expected future rate of return on pension plan assets, a lower discount rate environment and rising retiree medical costs, particularly for prescription drugs. However, based on our current estimates, we expect our pension and other postretirement benefits costs to decline by approximately $40 million in 2007. This decline is due primarily to improved actual investment returns and an increase in the discount rate environment in 2006 as well as the impact of the $100 million contribution we made to our U.S. pension plans in 2006. In the area of energy, natural gas costs in 2006 remained high by historical standards, but did decline slightly versus the 2005 levels. In 2005, natural gas supply was disrupted by the two severe hurricanes, Katrina and Rita, which impacted the U.S. Gulf Coast in the third and fourth quarters. Changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the operating performance of our Commodity Chemicals and Glass businesses. Each one dollar change in the price of natural gas per million British thermal units (mmbtu) has a direct impact of approximately $60 million to $70 million on our annual operating costs. Our 2006 natural gas costs averaged about $8.00 per mmbtu for the year, while our 2005 costs averaged about $8.50. While it remains difficult to predict future natural gas prices, in order to reduce the risks associated with volatile prices, we use a variety of techniques, which include reducing consumption through improved manufacturing processes, switching to alternative fuels and hedging. We currently estimate our cost for natural gas in the first quarter of 2007 will be lower than the first quarter of 2006. We currently have about 35% of our first quarter 2007 natural gas purchases hedged at a price of about $8.30, and roughly 30% of our 2007 annual requirements hedged at about $8.00. For the past several years we have also experienced increases in the prices we pay for raw materials used in many of our businesses, particularly in our coatings businesses. These increases have resulted from the industrial expansion, supply/demand imbalance and increases in supplier costs for oil and other inputs. Year over year coatings raw material costs rose by $245 million in 2005 and costs advanced another $75 million in 2006. We have and plan to continue to combat the impact of these rising costs by seeking alternate and global supply sources for our raw materials, reformulating our products, improving our production processes and raising our selling prices. The same economic factors, along with high capacity utilization and industry related hurricane outages, resulted in tight supplies of chlor alkali products in 2005 and a large portion of 2006. This led to record ECU pricing during all of 2005, followed by another record year in 2006. First quarter 2006 ECU prices reached all time levels for PPG, and prices gradually descended each subsequent quarter. Separately, during 2006 several chlor alkali competitors in the industry announced permanent facility shutdowns which equate to approximately 4% of the North American production capacity. The largest portion of these, approximately 3%, was completed in the fourth quarter of 2006, with the remainder scheduled for late 2007. In the fourth quarter of 2006, PPGs chlor alkali volumes were curtailed due to facility shutdowns by several large customers. These facility shutdowns were due, in part, to inventory management initiatives by customers, reflecting slowing in several of their U.S. end markets. 22 2006 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis We see a continued, dynamic chlor alkali environment in 2007. It is uncertain when some of these customers will return to a normal level of production which may impact the sales and earnings of our chlor alkali business in early 2007. PPG also supplies a variety of product into the U.S. residential and commercial construction markets. In 2006, the demand in the U.S. residential market dropped notably, as U.S. housing starts declined 13%. Conversely, investment in commercial construction increased by more than 15%. Also, the North American automotive industry continues to experience structural change, including the loss of U.S. market share by General Motors, Ford, and Daimler Chrysler. This has resulted in continuation of a very challenging and competitive environment for all suppliers to this industry. These OEMs are also faced with, among other things, funding substantial pension and post retirement medical liabilities that place stress on their financial condition. Our 2006 sales in the U.S. and Canada to General Motors, Ford and the automotive tiered suppliers whose Standard & Poors credit rating was BB or lower at Dec. 31, 2006 totaled approximately 4% of our total global sales. These sales were made under normal credit terms, and we expect to collect substantially all of the amounts due from these customers at Dec. 31, 2006 during the first quarter of 2007; however, we continue to focus on the management of this credit risk. In 2006 we continued work on a major business process redesign project in our European coatings businesses that has the objectives of improving our competitiveness, supporting our initiatives to grow the business and increasing our margins. The project will standardize our business processes throughout the region on a common IT application platform in a newly defined business model that includes a new European headquarters established in Switzerland. We reached the first key milestone in this project in 2006 as we moved our European refinish business to the new business model over the first half of 2006. The net cost savings in 2006 were not significant but will increase as project activities continue through 2008 as we move our other European coatings businesses to this new model in 2007 and 2008. We completed a series of acquisitions in 2006 that are intended to strengthen our coatings and optical products businesses by broadening their product offerings and geographic breadth. Sales increased in 2006 by $379 million due to acquisitions, and the acquired businesses were slightly accretive to earnings in 2006. We expect sales in 2007 from these acquisitions to be $700 million to $800 million with meaningful earnings growth. While we anticipate some ongoing challenges entering 2007 due to continued softness in a few U.S. customer markets, we anticipate that solid global economic conditions will remain. We expect to continue capitalizing on this environment with organic growth, especially in emerging regions, and remain committed to continuing our consistent track record of cash generation for the ongoing benefit of our shareholders. Accounting Standards Adopted in 2006 Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K details the impact of the Companys adoption of the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), Share Based Payment; SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4; and SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). Accounting Standards to be Adopted in Future Years In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15, 2006. We are in the process of evaluating the effect that the adoption of this interpretation will have on PPG. We currently expect that we will reduce our tax contingency reserve by an amount that will not have a material effect on PPGs financial position. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This standard only applies when other standards require or permit the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities. It does not increase the use of fair value measurement. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after Nov. 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this Statement; however, we do not expect it to have an effect on PPGs consolidated results of operations or financial position. Performance in 2005 Compared with 2004 Performance Overview Our sales increased 7% to $10.2 billion in 2005 compared to $9.5 billion in 2004. Sales increased 6% due to higher selling prices, primarily in our Commodity Chemicals, Industrial Coatings and Performance and Applied Coatings reportable business segments, and 1% due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation. The impact 2006 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 23 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of increased volumes in our Performance and Applied Coatings, Optical and Specialty Materials and Glass reportable business segments was offset by volume declines in the Commodity Chemicals reportable business segment. The volume decline in the Commodity Chemicals reportable business segment was due in part to lost sales resulting from the impact of Hurricane Rita, as discussed below. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased to 63.5% as compared to 63.1% in 2004. Inflation, including higher coatings raw material costs and higher energy costs in our Commodity Chemicals and Glass reportable business segments increased our cost of sales. Selling, general and administrative expense declined slightly as a percentage of sales to 17.4% despite increasing by $56 million in 2005. These costs increased primarily due to increased advertising in our optical products operating segment and higher expenses due to store expansions in our architectural coatings operating segment. Interest expense declined $9 million in 2005, reflecting the year over year reduction in the outstanding debt balance of $80 million. Other charges increased $284 million in 2005 primarily due to pretax charges of $132 million related to the Marvin legal settlement, net of $18 million in insurance recoveries, $61 million for the federal glass class action antitrust legal settlement, $34 million of direct costs related to the impact of hurricanes Rita and Katrina, $27 million for an asset impairment charge in our fine chemicals operating segment, $19 million for debt refinancing costs and an increase of $12 million for environmental remediation costs. Net income and earnings per share assuming dilution for 2005 were $596 million and $3.49 respectively, compared to $683 million and $3.95, respectively, for 2004. Net income in 2005 included aftertax charges of $117 million, or 68 cents a share, for legal settlements net of insurance; $21 million, or 12 cents a share for direct costs related to the impact of hurricanes Katrina and Rita; $17 million, or 10 cents a share related to an asset impairment charge related to our fine chemicals business; and $12 million, or 7 cents a share, for debt refinancing costs. The legal settlements net of insurance include aftertax charges of $80 million for the Marvin legal settlement, net of insurance recoveries, and $37 million for the impact of the federal glass class action antitrust legal settlement. Net income for 2005 and 2004 included an aftertax charge of $13 million, or 8 cents a share, and $19 million, or 11 cents a share, respectively, to reflect the net increase in the current value of the Companys obligation relating to asbestos claims under the PPG Settlement Arrangement. Results of Reportable Business Segments Net sales Segment income (Millions) 2005 2004 2005 2004 Industrial Coatings $ 2,921 $ 2,818 $ 284 $ 338 Performance and Applied Coatings 2,668 2,478 464 451 Optical and Specialty Materials 867 805 158 186 Commodity Chemicals 1,531 1,229 313 113 Glass 2,214 2,183 123 166 Sales of Industrial Coatings increased $103 million or 4% in 2005. Sales increased 2% due to higher selling prices in our industrial and packaging coatings businesses and 2% due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation. Volume was flat year over year as increased volume in automotive coatings was offset by lower volume in industrial and packaging coatings. Segment income decreased $54 million in 2005. The decrease in segment income was due to the adverse impact of inflation, including raw materials costs increases of about $170 million, which more than offset the benefits of higher selling prices, improved sales margin mix, formula cost reductions, lower manufacturing costs and higher other income. Performance and Applied Coatings sales increased $190 million or 8% in 2005. Sales increased 4% due to higher selling prices in all three operating segments, 3% due to increased volumes as increases in our aerospace and architectural coatings businesses exceeded volume declines in automotive refinish, and 1% due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation. Performance and Applied Coatings segment income increased $13 million in 2005. Segment income increased due to the impact of increased sales volumes described above and higher other income, which combined to offset the negative impacts of higher overhead costs to support the growth in these businesses, particularly in the architectural coatings business, and higher manufacturing costs. The impact of higher selling prices fully offset the adverse impact of inflation, including raw materials cost increases of about $75 million. Optical and Specialty Materials sales increased $62 million or 8%. Sales increased 8% due to higher sales volumes in our optical products and silica businesses, which offset lower sales volumes in our fine chemicals business. Sales increased 1% due to an acquisition in our optical products business and decreased 1% due to lower pricing. Segment income decreased $28 million. The primary factor decreasing segment income was the $27 million impairment charge related to our fine chemicals business. The impact of higher sales volumes described above was offset by higher inflation, including increased energy costs; lower selling prices; increased overhead costs in our optical products business to support growth 24 2006 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis and $4 million of direct costs related to the impact of the hurricanes. Market conditions, such as fewer new drug approvals, product withdrawals, excess production capacity and increasing share of generic drugs, put pressure on the pharmaceutical industry and created a challenging environment for our fine chemicals business. These conditions produced an operating performance in fine chemicals in 2005 that was disappointing. As a result, in the fourth quarter, the Company evaluated our fine chemicals business for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets, and determined that indicators of impairment were present for certain long lived assets at our manufacturing plant in the United States. In measuring the fair value of these assets, the Company utilized an expected cash flow methodology to determine that the carrying value of these assets exceeded their fair value by $24 million. We also wrote down the assets of a small fine chemical facility in France to their estimated net realizable value. Due to these developments, the Company recorded an asset impairment charge related to these fine chemicals assets of $27 million pretax, which was included in Other charges in the statement of income for the year ended Dec. 31, 2005. Commodity Chemicals sales increased $302 million or 25%. Sales increased 35% due to higher selling prices and decreased 10% due to lower sales volumes, which were adversely impacted in the third and fourth quarters by the impact of the hurricanes. Segment income increased $200 million in 2005. The primary factor increasing segment income was the record high selling prices in 2005. Factors decreasing segment income were higher inflation, including $127 million due to increased energy and ethylene costs; $29 million of direct costs related to the impact of the hurricanes; lower sales volumes; higher manufacturing costs; and increased environmental remediation expense. The hurricanes hit the Gulf Coast in September impacting volumes and costs in September through November and contributing to the rise in natural gas prices which lowered fourth quarter Commodity Chemicals earnings by $54 million, almost 58% of the full year impact of higher natural gas prices. The damage caused by Hurricane Rita resulted in the shutdown of our Lake Charles, LA chemicals plant for a total of eight days in September and an additional five days in October. On Sept. 26, 2005, following Hurricane Rita, PPG declared force majeure for products produced at the Lake Charles facility. On Oct. 6, 2005, the facility resumed production at reduced operating rates, and returned to full production capability in mid November. PPG recorded a pretax charge in the amount of $34 million in 2005 for direct costs primarily related to hurricane damage to the Lake Charles facility. This charge is included in Other charges in the statement of income under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2005. The Company also estimates that pretax earnings were reduced by approximately $27 million in 2005 due to lower sales volumes resulting from Hurricane Rita. The Company was engaged in discussions in early 2006 with its insurance providers that resulted in insurance recoveries in the third quarter of 2006. Glass sales increased $31 million or 1% in 2005. Sales increased 1% due to improved volumes as increases in our automotive replacement glass and services and performance glazings businesses offset volume declines in our fiber glass and automotive original equipment glass businesses. The positive effects of foreign currency translation were largely offset by lower selling prices primarily in our automotive replacement glass and services and automotive original equipment businesses. Segment income decreased $43 million in 2005. The $49 million impact of rising natural gas costs and the absence of the $19 million gain in 2004 from the sale/leaseback of precious metals combined to account for a reduction in segment income of $68 million. The remaining year over year increase in Glass segment income of $25 million resulted primarily from improved manufacturing efficiencies and lower overhead costs exceeding the adverse impact of other inflation. Our continuing efforts in 2005 to position the fiber glass business for future growth in profitability were adversely impacted by the rise in fourth quarter natural gas prices, slightly lower year over year sales, lower equity earnings due to weaker pricing in the Asian electronics market, and the absence of the $19 million gain which occurred in 2004 stemming from the sale/ leaseback of precious metals. Despite high energy costs, we expected fiber glass earnings to improve in 2006 because of price strengthening in the Asian electronics market, which began to occur in the fourth quarter of 2005, increased cost reduction initiatives and the positive impact resulting from the start up of our new joint venture in China. This joint venture will produce high labor content fiber glass reinforcement products and take advantage of lower labor costs, allowing us to refocus our U.S. production capacity on higher margin direct process products. The 2005 earnings of our North American automotive OEM glass operating segment declined by $30 million compared with 2004. Significant structural changes continue to occur in the North American automotive industry, including the loss of U.S. market share by General Motors and Ford. This has created a challenging and competitive environment for all suppliers to the domestic OEMs, including our operating segment. About half of the decline in earnings resulted from the impact of rising natural gas costs, particularly in the fourth quarter, combined with the traditional adverse impact of year over year sales price reductions producing a decline in 2006 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 25 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis earnings that exceeded our successful efforts to reduce manufacturing costs. The other half of the 2005 decline was due to lower sales volumes and mix and higher new program launch costs. Other Significant Factors The Companys pension and other postretirement benefit costs for 2005 were $12 million lower than in 2004. This decrease represents the impact of market driven growth in pension plan assets that occurred in 2004 and an increased benefit provided by the subsidy offered pursuant to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement Act of 2003 (the Medicare Act) in 2005, offset in part by a decrease in the discount rate. The majority of the Companys defined benefit plans continued to be underfunded on an accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) basis at Dec. 31, 2005. The underfunded amount increased in 2005, resulting in an increase in the minimum pension liability and a decrease in shareholders equity through a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income of $173 million, aftertax. This increase in the underfunded amount reflects a reduction of 40 basis points in the discount rate and the impact of a change in the mortality assumption for the U.S. plans used to calculate the ABO. See Note 13, Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for additional information. In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA 2004) was signed into law. Among its many provisions, the AJCA 2004 provided a limited opportunity through 2005 to repatriate the undistributed earnings of non U.S. subsidiaries at a U.S. tax cost that could be lower than the normal tax cost on such distributions. During 2005, we repatriated $114 million of dividends under the provisions of AJCA 2004 resulting in income tax expense of $9 million. In the absence of AJCA 2004, the Company estimates the tax cost to repatriate these dividends would have been $23 million higher. The effective tax rate for 2005 was 29.8% compared to 30.3% for 2004. The 2005 effective tax rate included a tax benefit of 39% on the $132 million charge for the Marvin legal settlement net of insurance recoveries, the $61 million settlement of the federal glass class action antitrust case, the $27 million asset impairment charge related to our fine chemicals operating segment, the $19 million charge for debt refinancing costs and the adjustment to increase the current value of the Companys obligation related to asbestos claims under the PPG Settlement Arrangement, as discussed in Note 14, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The effective tax rate also included tax expense of $9 million related to dividends repatriated under the AJCA 2004 and tax expense of 31.0% on the remaining pretax earnings. The 2005 effective tax rate also included the benefit of the U.S. manufacturing deduction, which was created by AJCA 2004. The 2004 effective tax rate included a tax benefit of 39% on the adjustment to increase the current value of the Companys obligation related to asbestos claims under the PPG Settlement Arrangement and tax expense of 30.5% on the remaining pretax earnings. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, including Environmental Matters PPG is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against others, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings of this Form 10 K and Note 14, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for a description of certain of these lawsuits, including a description of the proposed PPG Settlement Arrangement for asbestos claims announced on May 14, 2002 and a description of the antitrust suits against PPG related to the flat glass and automotive refinish industries. As discussed in Item 3 and Note 14, although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable, management believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving PPG, including asbestos related claims in the event the PPG Settlement Arrangement described in Note 14 does not become effective, will not have a material effect on PPGs consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. It is PPGs policy to accrue expenses for environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted. As of Dec. 31, 2006 and 2005, PPG had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling $282 million and $94 million, respectively, of which $65 million and $29 million, respectively, were classified as current liabilities. Pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2006, 2005 and 2004 totaled $207 million, $27 million and $15 million, respectively, and are included in Other charges in the statement of income. Cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated $22 million, $14 million and $26 million, in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition to the amounts currently reserved, the Company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as $200 million to $300 million, which range has been revised since Dec. 31, 2005 to reflect the impact of the 26 2006 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis submission of a feasibility study work plan for the former chromium manufacturing plant site located in Jersey City, NJ and of the draft remediation feasibility study for the Calcasieu River Estuary, which included the pretax charge of $173 million recorded in the third quarter of 2006, for the estimated costs of remediating these sites, which actions are more fully described in Note 14. Such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence. Management anticipates that the resolution of the Companys environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time. Over the 15 years prior to 2006, the pretax charges against income ranged between $10 million and $49 million per year. Consistent with our previous disclosure, charges for estimated environmental remediation costs in 2006 were significantly higher than our historical range as a result of our continuing efforts to analyze and assess the environmental issues associated with a former chromium manufacturing plant site located in Jersey City, NJ and at the Calcasieu River Estuary located near our Lake Charles, LA chlor alkali plant. We anticipate that charges against income in 2007 will be within the prior historical range. We expect cash outlays for environmental remediation costs to be approximately $65 million in 2007 and to range from $50 million to $70 million annually through 2011. It is possible, however, that technological, regulatory and enforcement developments, the results of environmental studies and other factors could alter these expectations. See Note 14 for an expanded description of certain of these environmental contingencies. In managements opinion, the Company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the Companys environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on PPGs financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. Impact of Inflation In 2006, the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation, including the impact of higher raw material costs in our coatings businesses, was offset by higher selling prices in our Industrial Coatings, Performance and Applied Coatings and Commodity Chemicals reportable segments and by reduced manufacturing costs in our Glass and Optical and Specialty Materials reportable segments. In 2005, the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation, including the impact of higher coatings raw material costs and higher energy costs in our Glass and Commodity Chemicals businesses were offset by higher selling prices in our Commodity Chemicals and Performance and Applied Coatings reportable segments but were not offset by the combination of higher selling prices and lower manufacturing costs in our Industrial Coatings, Optical and Specialty Materials and Glass reportable segments. In 2004, the combined impact of lower overall selling prices and higher production costs, due to the negative effects of inflation, including the impact of higher raw material and labor costs across all our reportable segments and higher energy costs in our Glass and Commodity Chemicals businesses, was only partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. We expect that the gradual decline in ECU pricing in our Commodity Chemicals reportable segment that began in the second quarter of 2006 will continue into 2007. We also expect pricing pressure to continue in Glass in 2007. The combination of the negative impact of inflation and lower pricing is expected to exceed the productivity improvements and lower manufacturing costs for 2007 in the Commodity Chemicals and Glass reportable segments. In the remaining reportable segments, the combination of higher selling prices and lower manufacturing costs is expected to offset the negative impact of inflation. Liquidity and Capital Resources During the past three years, we had sufficient financial resources to meet our operating requirements, to fund our capital spending, share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to our shareholders. Cash from operating activities was $1,130 million, $1,065 million and $1,018 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Capital spending was $774 million, $379 million and $311 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. This spending related to modernization and productivity improvements, expansion of existing businesses, environmental control projects and business acquisitions, which amounted to $402 million, $91 million and $67 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We also assumed $80 million in debt in connection with acquisitions in 2006. Capital spending, excluding acquisitions, is expected to be $350 to $400 million during 2007. During 2007, we anticipate making acquisitions as part of our strategy for accelerating growth. Any acquisitions would be funded through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated from operations or from the sale of other businesses and, if necessary, external funding sources or the issuance of stock. In Jan. 2007, the Company acquired the architectural and industrial coatings business of Renner Sayerlack, S.A., Gravatai, Brazil. Dividends paid to shareholders totaled $316 million, $316 million and $307 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. PPG has paid uninterrupted dividends since 2006 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 27 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis 1899, and 2006 marked the 35th consecutive year of increased dividend payments to shareholders. In Jan. 2007, our board of directors raised the quarterly dividend on our common stock to 50 cents from 48 cents a share. Over time, our goal is to sustain our dividends at approximately one third of our earnings per share. During 2006, the Company repurchased 2.3 million shares of PPG common stock at a cost of $153 million under a previously authorized share repurchase program. During 2005, the Company repurchased 9.4 million shares of PPG common stock at a cost of $607 million and during 2004, the Company repurchased 1.5 million shares of PPG common stock at a cost of $100 million. Cash contributions to our employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) and related expense were reduced by $18 million in 2006 by the appreciation on PPG shares purchased prior to Dec. 31, 1992 allocated to participant accounts during 2006. We expect cash contributions to the ESOP and related expense to be reduced by $10 million in 2007 by the appreciation on such shares. During June 2005, the Company completed a debt refinancing consisting of tender offers in the United States to retire outstanding debt combined with the issuance of bonds in Europe. As part of this refinancing, the Company issued 300 million of 3.875% Senior Notes due 2015 (the Euro Notes). The proceeds from the Euro Notes were used to repay short term commercial paper obligations incurred in June 2005 in connection with the purchase of $100 million of 6.5% notes due 2007, $159 million of 7.05% notes due 2009 and $16 million of 6.875% notes due 2012, as well as for general corporate purposes. The Company recorded a second quarter 2005 pre tax charge of approximately $19 million, ($12 million after tax or 7 cents per share), for debt refinancing costs. On Aug. 17, 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the PPA) was signed into law, changing the funding requirements for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans beginning in 2008. Under current funding requirements, PPG did not have to make a mandatory contribution to our U.S. plans in 2006, and we do not expect to have a mandatory contribution to these plans in 2007. We are currently evaluating the impact that PPA will have on our funding requirements for 2008 and beyond. In 2006, 2005 and 2004 we made voluntary contributions to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans of $100 million, $4 million and $100 million, respectively, and contributions to our non U.S. defined benefit pension plans of $24 million, $26 million and $40 million, respectively, some of which were required by local funding requirements. We expect to make mandatory contributions to our non U.S. plans in 2007 of approximately $37 million. We expect to make a $100 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. plans in the first quarter of 2007, and we may make additional voluntary contributions in 2007. The ratio of total debt, including capital leases, to total debt and equity was 29% at Dec. 31, 2006 and Dec. 31, 2005. Cash from operations and the Companys debt capacity are expected to continue to be sufficient to fund capital spending, including acquisitions, share repurchases, dividend payments, contributions to pension plans, amounts due under the proposed PPG Settlement Arrangement and operating requirements, including PPGs significant contractual obligations, which are presented in the following table along with amounts due under the proposed PPG Settlement Arrangement: Obligations Due In: (Millions) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Contractual Obligations Long term debt $ 1,218 $ 64 $ 120 $ $ 1,034 Capital lease obligations 2 1 1 Operating leases 300 90 121 57 32 Unconditional purchase obligations 784 204 170 88 322 Total $ 2,304 $ 359 $ 412 $ 145 $ 1,388 Asbestos Settlement(1) Aggregate cash payments $ 998 $ 422 $ 66 $ 36 $ 474 PPG stock and other 135 135 Total $ 1,133 $ 557 $ 66 $ 36 $ 474 (1) We have recorded an obligation equal to the net present value of the aggregate cash payments, along with the PPG stock and other assets to be contributed to the Asbestos Settlement Trust. However, PPG has no obligation to pay any amounts under this settlement until the Effective Date, as more fully discussed in Note 14, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The unconditional purchase commitments are principally take or pay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials, including industrial gases, natural gas, coal and electricity, consistent with customary industry practice. These also include PPGs commitment to purchase electricity and steam from the RS Cogen joint venture discussed in Note 5, Investments, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. See Note 8, Debt and Bank Credit Agreements and Leases, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit, letters of credit, guarantees, and debt covenants. In addition to the amounts available under the lines of credit, the Company may issue up to $500 million aggregate principal amount of debt securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in July 1999. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Companys off balance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations disclosed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in the contractual obligations table as 28 2006 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in Note 8, Debt and Bank Credit Arrangements and Leases, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Estimates Management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under Item 8 of this Form 10 K and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate. We believe that the most critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements relate to accounting for contingencies, under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated, and to accounting for pensions, other postretirement benefits, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies. Contingencies, by their nature, relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss. The most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable, to environmental remediation, to pending, impending or overtly threatened litigation against the Company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years. For more information on these matters, see Note 3, Working Capital Detail, Note 12, Income Taxes and Note 14, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works. To accomplish this, extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, turnover, medical costs and discount rates. These assumptions are reviewed annually. See Note 13, Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for information on these plans and the assumptions used. The discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined in conjunction with our actuary by reference to a current yield curve and by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments. The discount rate assumption for 2007 is 5.90% for our U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. A reduction in the discount rate of 50 basis points, with all other assumptions held constant, would increase 2007 net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately $11 million and $5 million, respectively. The expected return on plan assets assumption used in accounting for our pension plans is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future long term investment returns. For 2006, the return on plan assets assumption for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans was 8.5%. We will use the same assumption for 2007. A reduction in the rate of return of 50 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would increase 2007 net periodic pension expense by approximately $12 million. Net periodic benefit cost for our U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans for each of the years ended Dec. 31, 2005 and 2004 was calculated using the GAM 83 mortality table, a commonly used mortality table. In 2006, we began to use RP 2000, a newer and more relevant mortality table to calculate net periodic benefit costs for these plans. This change in the mortality assumption in 2006 increased net periodic benefit costs by approximately $13 million and $4 million for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, respectively. As discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K, the Company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying values. Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows. Based on this testing, none of our goodwill was impaired as of Dec. 31, 2006. The excess of fair value over the carrying value of our fiber glass reporting unit grew during 2006 as a result of progress made during 2006 in achieving our multi year plan to improve profitability and cash flow. As part of our ongoing financial reporting process, a collaborative effort is undertaken involving PPG managers with functional responsibility for financial, credit, environmental, legal, tax and benefit matters and outside advisors such as consultants, engineers, lawyers and actuaries. The results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments on these contingencies and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements. We believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K related to these contingencies, pensions, other postretirement benefits, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate PPG management, although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates. 2006 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 29 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis Currency During 2006, the U.S. dollar weakened against the currencies of most of the countries in which PPG operates, most notably against the euro, the British pound sterling and the Australian dollar. The effects of translating the net assets of our operations denominated in non U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar increased consolidated net assets by $179 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2006. In addition, the weaker U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on 2006 pretax earnings of $9 million. The U.S. dollar was weaker than the euro and the British pound sterling for most of the first eight months of 2005 when compared with currency rates of 2004. The U.S. dollar strengthened against these currencies during the last four months of 2005. The effects of translating the net assets of our operations denominated in non U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar decreased consolidated net assets by $215 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2005. The effect of currency rate changes over the course of the year resulted in a net favorable impact on 2005 pretax earnings as compared with 2004 of $8 million. During 2004, the U.S. dollar weakened against the currencies of most of the countries in which PPG operated, most notably against the euro, the British pound sterling and the Canadian dollar. The effects of translating the net assets of our operations denominated in non U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar increased consolidated net assets by $180 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2004. In addition, the weaker U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on 2004 pretax earnings of $35 million. Research and Development Technological innovation has been a hallmark of our Companys success throughout its history. Research and development costs totaled over 3% of sales in each of the past three years, representing a level of expenditure that we expect to continue in 2007. These costs include technology driven improvements to our manufacturing processes and customer technical service, as well as the costs of developing new products and processes. Because of our broad array of products and customers, we are not materially dependent upon any single technology platform. Forward Looking Statements The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. Managements Discussion and Analysis and other sections of this Annual Report contain forward looking statements that reflect the Companys current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward looking statements are identified by the use of the words aim, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate and other expressions that indicate future events and trends. Any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also, note the following cautionary statements. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the Companys forward looking statements. Such factors include increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors, fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials, the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, economic and political conditions in international markets, the ability to penetrate existing, developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets, which also depends on economic and political conditions, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates, and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation, including litigation that could result if PPGs Settlement Agreement for asbestos claims does not become effective. However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, while the list of factors presented here is considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward looking statements. Consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forward looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk PPG is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and natural gas prices and to changes in PPGs stock price. The Company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks. A detailed description of these exposures and the Companys risk management policies are provided in Note 10, Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Activities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 30 2006 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis The following disclosures summarize PPGs exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage our exposure to such risks. Quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible, unfavorable changes in market rates can impact PPGs consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2006 and 2005 were used to hedge PPGs exposure to foreign currency transaction risk. The fair value of these contracts as of Dec. 31, 2006 and 2005 were assets of $2 million and $1 million, respectively. The potential reduction in PPGs earnings resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for European currencies and 20% for Asian and South American currencies for the years ended Dec. 31, 2006 and 2005 would have been $2 million and $1 million, respectively. PPG had non U.S. dollar denominated debt of $472 million as of Dec. 31, 2006 and $433 million as of Dec. 31, 2005. A weakening of the U.S. dollar by 10% against European currencies and by 20% against Asian and South American currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately $63 million and $50 million as of Dec. 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of PPGs interest rate risk. The fair value of the interest rate swaps was a liability of $7 million as of Dec. 31, 2006 and 2005. The fair value of these swaps would have decreased by $2 million and $3 million as of Dec. 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, if variable interest rates increased by 10%. A 10% increase in interest rates in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in Asia and South America would have affected PPGs variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense by approximately $2 million as of Dec. 31, 2006 and 2005. Further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the Companys fixed rate debt by approximately $51 million and $53 million as of Dec. 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively; however, such changes would not have had an effect on PPGs annual earnings or cash flows. The fair value of natural gas contracts in place as of Dec. 31, 2006 was a liability of $25 million. The fair value of natural gas swap contracts in place as of Dec. 31, 2005 was an asset of $0.3 million. These contracts were entered into to reduce PPGs exposure to higher prices of natural gas. A 10% reduction in the price of natural gas would result in a loss in the fair value of the underlying natural gas swap contracts outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2006 and 2005 of approximately $23 million and $3 million, respectively. An equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the Companys exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute PPG stock into an asbestos settlement trust (see Note 10 and Note 14, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K). The fair value of this instrument as of Dec. 31, 2006 and 2005 was an asset of $14 million and $10 million, respectively. A 10% decrease in PPGs stock price would have reduced the value of this instrument by $6 million and $5 million, respectively, as of Dec. 31, 2006 and 2005. 2006 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 31 Table of Contents
