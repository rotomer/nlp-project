Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Presentation of Discontinued Operations During the third quarter of 2007, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its automotive glass businesses to Platinum Equity (Platinum) for approximately $500 million. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of these businesses were classified as held for sale. In the fourth quarter of 2007, PPG was notified that affiliates of Platinum had filed suit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, alleging that Platinum was not obligated to consummate the agreement. Platinum subsequently terminated the agreement. PPG has sued Platinum and certain of its affiliates for damages, including the $25 million breakup fee stipulated by the terms of the agreement, based on various alleged actions of the Platinum parties. While the transaction with Platinum was terminated, PPG management remains committed to a sale of the automotive glass businesses. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of these businesses continue to be classified as held for sale and are stated at depreciated cost, which is lower than fair value less cost to sell, in the consolidated balance sheet under Item 8 of this Form 10 K as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. Further, the results of operations and cash flows of these businesses, which had previously been included in the Glass reportable segment, have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and cash flows under Item 8 for the three years ended December 31, 2007. 2007 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 19 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis The decision to sell these businesses triggered curtailments related to certain of PPGs defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. In 2007, PPG recorded a pretax charge of $17 million ($11 million aftertax), primarily representing curtailment losses on certain defined benefit pension plans. The sale of these businesses may result in additional curtailments and possibly settlements of other PPG employee benefit plans to be recorded upon or after the closing of a sale. In the third quarter of 2007, PPG entered into an agreement to sell its fine chemicals business to ZaCh System S.p.A., a subsidiary of Zambon Company S.p.A., for approximately $65 million. The sale of this business was completed in November 2007. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of this business have been reclassified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet under Item 8 as of December 31, 2006. Further, the results of operations and cash flows of this business, which had previously been included in the Optical and Specialty Materials reportable segment, have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and cash flows under Item 8 for the three years ended December 31, 2007. PPG recorded a pretax loss on sale of the fine chemicals business of $25 million ($19 million aftertax) in 2007. Performance in 2007 compared with 2006 Performance Overview Our sales increased 14% to $11.2 billion in 2007 compared to $9.9 billion in 2006. Sales increased 6% due to the impact of acquisitions, 4% due to increased volumes and 4% due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased slightly to 63.2% compared to 62.4% in 2006 due to the adverse impact of inflation net of selling price changes. Selling, general and administrative expense increased slightly as a percentage of sales to 19.1% compared to 18.6% in 2006. These costs increased primarily due to higher expenses related to growth, including increased advertising costs and the impact of inflation. Business restructuring expense decreased $35 million in 2007. In 2006, the Company finalized plans for certain actions to reduce its workforce and consolidate facilities and recorded a charge of $35 million. Other charges decreased $193 million in 2007. The reduction was primarily due to a reduction in environmental expenses, which were $195 million lower in 2007 as compared to 2006. Other earnings increased $24 million in 2007 due to higher royalty income, higher interest income and gains from asset sales. Net income and earnings per share assuming dilution for 2007 and 2006 are summarized below: ($ in Millions, except per share amounts) Twelve Months ended December 31, 2007 ContinuingOperations DiscontinuedOperations Total $ EPS $ EPS $ EPS Net income $ 815 $ 4.91 $ 19 $ 0.12 $ 834 $ 5.03 Net income includes: Charges related to: Acquisition related costs 4 0.03 4 0.03 Asbestos settlement net(1) 15 0.09 15 0.09 Glass divestiture 11 0.06 11 0.06 Fine chemicals divestiture 19 0.11 19 0.11 ($ in Millions, except per share amounts) Twelve Months endedDecember 31, 2006 ContinuingOperations DiscontinuedOperations Total $ EPS $ EPS $ EPS Net income $ 653 $ 3.92 $ 58 $ 0.35 $ 711 $ 4.27 Net income includes: Charges related to: Environmental remediation(2) 106 0.64 106 0.64 Legal settlements 26 0.15 26 0.15 Business restructuring 22 0.13 1 0.01 23 0.14 Asbestos settlement net(1) 17 0.10 17 0.10 Earnings from insurance recoveries (24 ) (0.14 ) (24 ) (0.14 ) (1) Net increase in the current value of the Companys obligation relating to asbestos claims under the PPG Settlement Arrangement.

Results of Reportable Business Segments Net sales Segment income (Millions) 2007 2006 2007 2006 Performance Coatings $ 3,811 $ 3,088 $ 563 $ 514 Industrial Coatings 3,646 3,236 370 349 Optical and Specialty Materials 1,029 904 235 217 Commodity Chemicals 1,539 1,483 243 285 Glass 1,181 1,150 90 99 Performance Coatings sales increased $723 million or 23% in 2007. Sales increased 15% due to sales from acquisitions in all three Performance Coatings businesses, 4% due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation and 3% due to improved sales volumes in our aerospace and automotive refinish businesses, which more than offset slightly lower volumes in architectural coatings. The volume growth in the aerospace and refinish businesses occurred throughout the world, while the volume decline in architectural coatings was in North America. Sales also increased 1% due to higher selling prices. Segment income increased $49 million to a total of $563 million in 2007. Factors increasing segment income were improved sales volumes, earnings from acquisitions and the positive impact of foreign currency translation. 20 2007 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis Additionally, the benefit of higher selling prices more than offset the impact of inflation. Segment income decreased due to higher overhead costs to support growth initiatives in this segment. Industrial Coatings sales increased $410 million or 13% in 2007. Sales increased 6% due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation, 4% due to acquisitions in our automotive and industrial coatings businesses and 3% from improved sales volumes as volume increases in automotive coatings and packaging coatings more than offset declines in the volume of the industrial coatings business in the U.S. and Canada. Volume growth in the automotive coatings businesses occurred in all regions of the world, while the volume growth in packaging coatings was experienced mainly in Asia and Europe. The decline in industrial coatings North American volumes overshadowed solid growth for this business in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Segment income increased $21 million in 2007 due to improved sales volumes, the impact of acquisitions, lower manufacturing costs and the positive impact of foreign currency translation. Factors decreasing segment income were inflation, including higher raw material costs, which more than offset a slight improvement in selling prices, and increased overhead costs to support growth initiatives. Optical and Specialty Materials sales increased $125 million or 14% in 2007. Sales increased 8% due to higher volumes primarily in the optical products business, 4% due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation, 1% as the result of sales from acquisitions in the optical products business and 1% due to higher selling prices. Segment income increased $18 million in 2007. The increase in segment income was primarily the result of the increased sales volumes partially offset by higher advertising expense related to optical products volume growth initiatives in all regions and to the impending launch of Transitions Opticals next generation lens product in the first quarter of 2008. Commodity Chemicals sales increased $56 million or 4% in 2007. Sales increased 9% due to higher sales volumes of caustic and derivatives, which was partially offset by a 5% decrease in selling prices in part due to lower natural gas input costs. Segment income decreased $42 million in 2007. Segment income was lower in large part due to lower selling prices, higher manufacturing costs, including maintenance costs and higher raw material costs. Segment income also decreased as a result of the absence of an insurance recovery received in 2006 for damage caused by Hurricane Rita in 2005. The benefit of lower energy and environmental costs and improved sales volumes were factors that increased segment income in 2007. Glass sales increased by $31 million or 3% in 2007. Sales increased 3% due to higher sales volumes and 2% due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation. The negative impact of lower selling prices in our performance glazings business reduced segment sales by 2%. Pricing in the performance glazings business includes a surcharge related to the cost of energy lagged by one quarter. The surcharge in 2006 exceeded the current year surcharge due to higher energy costs during the comparable periods. Segment income decreased $9 million in 2007. Segment income decreased due to the negative impact of inflation and lower pricing, including the lower energy surcharge in performance glazings. These factors were only partially offset by the benefit from higher sales volumes. See Note 24, Reportable Business Segment Information, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further information related to the Companys operating segments and reportable business segments. Other Significant Factors The effective tax rate on pretax earnings from continuing operations in 2007 was 28.6% compared to 25.1% in 2006. The rate in 2007 includes the benefit of $15 million for the reversal of a valuation allowance previously recorded against the benefit of a tax net operating loss carryforward, the benefit associated with an enacted reduction in the Canadian federal corporate income tax rate and a tax benefit of 39% on the adjustment to increase the current value of the Companys obligation relating to asbestos claims under the PPG Settlement Arrangement, as discussed in Note 15, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The tax rate was 30.3% on the remaining pretax earnings from continuing operations in 2007. The effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations in 2006 included the benefit of a tax refund from Canada resulting from the favorable resolution of a tax dispute dating back to 1998 and a tax benefit related to the settlement with the Internal Revenue Service of our tax returns for the years 2001 2003. In the aggregate, these benefits reduced 2006 income tax expense by $39 million. The 2006 effective tax rate also included a tax benefit of 36% on the charge for business restructuring and a tax benefit of 39% on the third quarter environmental remediation charge for sites in New Jersey and Louisiana, on the charges for legal settlements, and on the adjustment to increase the current value of the Companys obligation relating to asbestos claims under the PPG Settlement Arrangement. Income tax expense of 39% was recognized on certain insurance recoveries, and income tax expense of 31% was recognized on the remaining pretax earnings from continuing operations in 2006. The effective tax rate on pretax earnings from discontinued operations in 2007 was 47.6% compared to 2007 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 21 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis 37.8% in 2006. The rate in 2007 includes a tax benefit of 35% on the curtailment charge related to the automotive glass businesses and a tax benefit of 24% on the loss on the sale of the fine chemicals business. The tax rate was 39% on the remaining pretax earnings from discontinued operations in 2007. Outlook In 2007, the U.S. and overall North American economy continued a slowing trend which began during the second half of 2006. U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) increased about 2% for the year. Growth rates slowed in several U.S. end markets in the latter part of the year, but the growth rates were aided by higher exports and decreased imports. U.S. residential construction rates declined approximately 25% year over year, and North American vehicle production decreased by 3%. Despite these and other slowing markets, overall industrial production increased by 2%. Industrial production remains the economic metric that most positively correlates with our U.S. organic volume growth because it reflects activity in PPGs broad end use markets. The U.S. commercial construction sector continued to grow consistently throughout the year, increasing by approximately 15%. Overall inflation remained modest as low labor rates in emerging regions have continued to hold labor rates in the mature regions relatively flat. Global energy prices, primarily oil, and other basic raw material costs increased to new or close to new record high levels. Natural gas costs in the U.S. declined for the second consecutive year, but remain at elevated levels when viewed historically. The European economy grew at one of its highest rates in the past decade due to continued industrial activity and higher consumer spending. Western European vehicle production improved by 3%, and Eastern European automotive production grew by nearly 18%. Overall industrial production grew by 2.5%. The Asian economies continued to post very high growth rates both relative to other major economies and historically, driven by strong growth in China and India. Chinese industrial production once again grew at just under 20%, supported, in part, by growth exceeding 20% in automobile production. Overall China GDP improved by 11% for the second consecutive year. Entering 2008, the overall economic outlook is generally bearish with many economists concerned about the potential of a U.S. recession and its potential impact on the overall global economy. Meanwhile, inflation concerns have risen in basic materials, due primarily to oil prices which are at or close to all time record highs. Interest rates, which had been rising in many of the worlds major economies, are now expected to decrease or remain flat due to lower anticipated growth rates. Overall global growth is expected to continue as rapidly growing emerging regions, including China, India, Latin America and Eastern Europe, continue to grow into a more meaningful portion of the global economy. Despite slowing in the U.S. economy, and a variety of government actions in China designed to slow its growth rate, these emerging economies are expected to continue to produce growth rates well above those in more mature economies due in part to ongoing internal infrastructure expansion. This growth has benefited global companies, such as PPG as evidenced in 2007 when PPG grew organically by over 10% in these emerging regions. In 2008, we expect cost pressures in certain raw materials, transportation and healthcare to remain. As PPG has historically done, we anticipate offsetting these cost increases with aggressive raw material sourcing, manufacturing cost improvements, productivity gains and selling price increases. Our pension and post retirement benefit costs totaled $233 million in 2007, including a curtailment charge of $17 million related to discontinued operations. Excluding the curtailment charge, these costs decreased by $55 million compared to 2006. Based on our current estimates, we expect our pension and other postretirement benefits costs to decline by approximately $20 million in 2008. This decline is due primarily to an increase in the discount rate for 2008 as well as the impact of the $100 million contribution we made to our U.S. pension plans in 2007. With respect to energy costs, 2007 natural gas costs remained high but declined as compared to 2006. Changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the operating performance of our Commodity Chemicals and Glass businesses. Each one dollar change in our price of natural gas per million British thermal units (mmbtu) has a direct impact of $60 million to $70 million on our annual operating costs. Our 2007 natural gas costs averaged about $7.50 per mmbtu for the year, while our 2006 costs averaged about $8.00. While it remains difficult to predict future natural gas prices, in order to reduce the risks associated with volatile prices, we use a variety of techniques, which include reducing consumption through improved manufacturing processes, switching to alternative fuels and hedging. We currently estimate our cost for natural gas in the first quarter of 2008 will be higher than the first quarter of 2007. We currently have nearly 40% of our first quarter 2008 natural gas purchases hedged at a price of about $8.75, and approximately 30% of our 2008 annual requirements hedged at about $8.25. Over the past few years we have also experienced increases in the prices we pay for raw materials used in many of our businesses, particularly in our coatings 22 2007 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis businesses. The increases have resulted from global industrial expansion, supply/demand imbalance and increases in supplier feedstock costs. We have and plan to continue to combat the impact of these rising costs by seeking alternate and global supply sources for our raw materials, reformulating our products, improving our production processes and raising our selling prices. Year over year coatings raw material costs rose by $75 million in 2006, and the rate of increase slowed to approximately $40 million in 2007, which represented about a one percent increase. Our current forecast for the early portion of 2008 is for coatings raw material inflation, likely in the two to four percent range, supported primarily by higher oil prices. However, full year raw material inflation may increase or decrease, with the main driver likely being overall economic conditions and resulting supply and demand factors. In 2007 we completed several acquisitions that are intended to strengthen our coatings businesses by extending their geographic breadth. In addition, several acquisitions were completed in the middle or toward the end of 2006. The sales for businesses held for less than one year added slightly less than $600 million to PPGs 2007 sales with operating margins approaching, but just below coatings industry averages. Also in 2007, we sold our fine chemicals business and our Azdel fiber glass joint venture, and closed our Venezulean fiber glass joint venture. Additionally, we signed a contract for the sale of our automotive glass businesses; however this contract was later terminated by the purchaser. Nevertheless, we intend to sell the automotive glass businesses during 2008. On January 2, 2008, PPG completed the purchase of SigmaKalon, a worldwide coatings producer based in the Netherlands, for approximately $3.2 billion. PPG expects 2008 sales from this acquisition of about $3 billion. This acquisition is not expected to be accretive to PPGs earnings in 2008 due, in part, to certain acquisition related costs. PPG utilized interim debt financing upon closing of the transaction, and will install longer term financing during 2008. The acquisition greatly extends PPGs European coatings operations and customer breadth, and is expected to be accretive to earnings in 2009. Economic conditions entering 2008 are challenging due primarily to continued softness in several U.S. markets and concern over global credit issues. The acquisition of SigmaKalon will result in a shift of our geographic sales mix, as now less than 50% of our sales will be derived in the U.S. and Canada. We anticipate continued organic growth in 2008 due to this more diverse geographic sales mix, along with our larger sales base in emerging regions. We anticipate this growth, coupled with our focus on cost improvement, will allow us to continue with our legacy of cash generation for the ongoing benefit of our shareholders. Accounting Standard Adopted in 2007 In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, (FASB), issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN No. 48 as of January 1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of FIN No. 48, the Company reduced its liability for unrecognized tax benefits by $11 million, which was recorded as a direct increase in retained earnings. Refer to Note 13, Income Taxes, under Item 8 for additional information. Accounting Standards to be Adopted in Future Years In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework in generally accepted accounting principles for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This standard only applies when other standards require or permit the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities. It does not increase the use of fair value measurement. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, except as it relates to nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities, for which SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company evaluated the impact of adopting this statement, and concluded it will not have a significant effect on PPGs consolidated results of operations or financial position. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates and report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company evaluated the impact of adopting this Statement, and concluded it will not have an effect on PPGs consolidated results of operations or financial position. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No.141(R)), which replaces SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) retains the underlying 2007 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 23 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis concepts of SFAS No. 141 in that all business combinations are still required to be accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting, but SFAS No. 141(R) changes the method of applying the acquisition method in a number of significant aspects. Acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred; noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date; in process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to December 15, 2008, with an exception related to the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired contingencies related to acquisitions completed before the effective date. SFAS No. 141(R) amends SFAS No. 109 to require adjustments, made after the effective date of this statement, to valuation allowances for acquired deferred tax assets and income tax positions to be recognized as income tax expense. Beginning January 1, 2009, PPG will apply the provisions of SFAS No. 141(R) to its accounting for applicable business combinations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51. This statement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. SFAS No. 160 requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest (minority interest) as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parents equity. The amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. SFAS No. 160 amends certain of ARB No. 51s consolidation procedures for consistency with the requirements of SFAS No. 141(R). This statement requires changes in the parents ownership interest of consolidated subsidiaries to be accounted for as equity transactions. This statement also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest. We are currently evaluating the effects that SFAS No. 160 may have on our consolidated financial statements. In November 2007, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF Issue No. 07 1, Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements, which defines collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting and disclosure requirements for such arrangements. EITF 07 1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of adopting the provisions EITF 07 1; however, it does not anticipate that adoption will have a material effect on PPGs consolidated results of operations or financial position. In March 2007, EITF Issue No. 06 10, Accounting for Collateral Assignment Split Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements, was issued. Under the provisions of EITF 06 10, an employer is required to recognize a liability for the postretirement benefit related to a collateral assignment split dollar life insurance arrangement in accordance with either SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, or Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 12, Omnibus Opinion 1967, if the employer has agreed to maintain a life insurance policy during the employees retirement or provide the employee with a death benefit based on the substantive arrangement with the employee. The provisions of EITF 06 10 also require an employer to recognize and measure the asset in a collateral assignment split dollar life insurance arrangement based on the nature and substance of the arrangement. EITF 06 10 is effective as of January 1, 2008. PPG has collateral assignment split dollar life insurance arrangements within the scope of EITF 06 10. The Company will adopt the provisions of EITF 06 10 as of January 1, 2008, and does not expect it to have a material effect on PPGs consolidated results of operations or financial position. Performance in 2006 Compared with 2005 Performance Overview Our sales increased 9% to $9.9 billion in 2006 compared to $9.0 billion in 2005. Sales increased 4% due to the impact of acquisitions, 2% due to increased volumes, 2% due to increased selling prices and 1% due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased slightly to 62.4% compared to 62.0% in 2005 due to the adverse impact of inflation net of selling price changes. Selling, general and administrative expense increased slightly as a percentage of sales to 18.6% compared to 18.0% in 2005. These costs increased primarily due to higher expenses related to expansion of the company owned store network in our architectural coatings business and increased advertising to promote sales growth in our optical products business. Business restructuring expense increased $35 million in 2006, as the Company finalized plans for certain actions to reduce its workforce and consolidate facilities and recorded a related charge. Other charges decreased $56 million in 2006. Other charges in 2006 included pretax charges of $185 million for estimated environmental remediation costs at sites in 24 2007 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis New Jersey and $42 million for legal settlements offset in part by pretax earnings of $44 million for insurance recoveries related to the Marvin legal settlement and to Hurricane Rita. Other charges in 2005 included pretax charges of $132 million related to the Marvin legal settlement net of related insurance recoveries of $18 million, $61 million for the federal glass class action antitrust legal settlement, $34 million of direct costs related to the impact of hurricanes Rita and Katrina and $19 million for debt refinancing costs. Other earnings increased $24 million in 2006 due to higher equity earnings, primarily from our Asian fiber glass joint ventures, and higher royalty income.

Sales increased 8% due to acquisitions, 4% due to higher selling prices in the refinish, aerospace and architectural coatings businesses, 3% due to increased volumes in our aerospace and architectural coatings businesses and 1% due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation. Segment income increased $50 million in 2006. The increase in segment income was primarily due to the impact of increased sales volume and higher selling prices, which more than offset the impact of inflation. Segment income was reduced by increased overhead costs to support growth in our architectural coatings business. Industrial Coatings sales increased $315 million or 11% in 2006. Sales increased 4% due to acquisitions, 4% due to increased volumes in the automotive, industrial and packaging coatings businesses, 2% due to higher selling prices, particularly in the industrial and packaging coatings businesses, and 1% due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation. Segment income increased $65 million in 2006. The increase in segment income was primarily due to the impact of increased sales volume, lower overhead and manufacturing costs, and the impact of acquisitions. Segment income was reduced by the adverse impact of inflation, which was substantially offset by higher selling prices. Optical and Specialty Materials sales increased $113 million or 14% in 2006. Sales increased 8% due to higher volumes, particularly in optical products, 5% due to acquisitions in our optical products business and 1% due to higher selling prices. Segment income increased $18 million in 2006. The increase in segment income was primarily due to increased volumes, lower manufacturing costs and the absence of the 2005 hurricane costs of $3 million, net of 2006 insurance recoveries, which were only partially offset by increased overhead costs in our optical products business to support growth and the negative impact of inflation. Commodity Chemicals sales decreased $48 million or 3% in 2006. Sales decreased 4% due to lower chlor alkali volumes and increased 1% due to higher selling prices. Segment income decreased $28 million in 2006. The year over year decline in segment income was due primarily to lower sales volumes and higher manufacturing costs associated with reduced production levels. The absence of the 2005 charges for direct costs related to hurricanes increased segment income by $29 million. The impact of higher selling prices; lower inflation, primarily natural gas costs; and an insurance recovery of $10 million related to the 2005 hurricane losses also increased segment income in 2006. Our fourth quarter chlor alkali sales volumes and earnings were negatively impacted by production outages at several customers over the last two months of 2006. Glass sales increased $33 million or 3% in 2006. Sales increased 2% due to improved volumes in our performance glazings business and 1% due to higher 2007 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 25 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis selling prices in performance glazings. Segment income increased $39 million in 2006. This increase in segment income was primarily the result of higher selling prices, higher equity earnings from our Asian fiber glass joint ventures, higher other income and lower manufacturing and natural gas costs, which more than offset the negative impacts of higher inflation and lower margin mix of sales. Our fiber glass business made progress during 2006 in achieving our multi year plan to improve profitability and cash flow. A transformation of our supply chain, which includes production of a more focused product mix at each manufacturing plant, manufacturing cost reduction initiatives and improved equity earnings from our Asian joint ventures are the primary focus and represent the critical success factors in this plan. During 2006, our new joint venture in China started producing high labor content fiber glass reinforcement products, which allows us to refocus our U.S. production capacity on higher margin, direct process products. The 2006 earnings improvement by our fiber glass business accounted for the bulk of the 2006 improvement in the Glass reportable business segment income. See Note 24, Reportable Business Segment Information, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further information related to our operating segments and reportable business segments. Other Significant Factors The effective tax rate on pretax earnings from continuing operations in 2006 was 25.1% compared to 29.0% in 2005. The effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations in 2006 included the benefit of a tax refund from Canada resulting from the favorable resolution of a tax dispute dating back to 1998 and a tax benefit related to the settlement with the Internal Revenue Service of our tax returns for the years 2001 2003. In the aggregate, these benefits reduced 2006 income tax expense by $39 million. The 2006 effective tax rate also included a tax benefit of 36% on the charge for business restructuring and a tax benefit of 39% on the third quarter environmental remediation charge for sites in New Jersey and Louisiana, on the charges for legal settlements, and on the adjustment to increase the current value of the Companys obligation relating to asbestos claims under the PPG Settlement Arrangement, as discussed in Note 15, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Income tax expense of 39% was recognized on certain insurance recoveries, and income tax expense of 31.0% was recognized on the remaining pretax earnings from continuing operations in 2006. The effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations in 2005 included a tax benefit of 39% on the charge for the Marvin legal settlement net of insurance recoveries, the settlement of the federal glass class action antitrust case, the charge for debt refinancing costs and the adjustment to increase the current value of the Companys obligation relating to asbestos claims under the PPG Settlement Arrangement. The 2005 effective tax rate also included tax expense of $9 million related to dividends repatriated under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and tax expense of 30.3% on the remaining pretax earnings. The effective tax rate on pretax earnings from discontinued operations in 2006 was 37.8% compared to 39.4% in 2005. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, including Environmental Matters PPG is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against others, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Note 15, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for a description of certain of these lawsuits, including a description of the proposed PPG Settlement Arrangement for asbestos claims announced on May 14, 2002 and a description of the antitrust suits against PPG related to the flat glass and automotive refinish industries. As discussed in Item 3 and Note 15, although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable, management believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving PPG, including asbestos related claims in the event the PPG Settlement Arrangement described in Note 15 does not become effective, will not have a material effect on PPGs consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. It is PPGs policy to accrue expenses for environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted. Management anticipates that the resolution of the Companys environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, PPG had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling $276 million and $282 million, respectively, of which $57 million and $65 million, respectively, were classified as current liabilities. Pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2007, 2006 and 2005 totaled $12 million, $207 million and $27 million, respectively, and are included in Other charges in the consolidated statement of income. Cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated $19 million, $22 million and $14 million, in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In addition to the amounts currently reserved for environmental remediation, the Company may be subject 26 2007 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as $200 million to $300 million, which range is unchanged since December 31, 2006. Such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence. Charges for estimated environmental remediation costs in 2006 were significantly higher than our historical range. Our continuing efforts to analyze and assess the environmental issues associated with a former chromium manufacturing plant site located in Jersey City, NJ and at the Calcasieu River Estuary located near our Lake Charles, LA chlor alkali plant resulted in a pre tax charge of $173 million in the third quarter of 2006 for the estimated costs of remediating these sites. Excluding 2006, pretax charges against income have ranged between $10 million and $49 million per year for the past 15 years. We anticipate that charges against income in 2008 for environmental remediation costs will be within this historical range. Management expects cash outlays for environmental remediation costs to be approximately $45 million in 2008 and to range from $35 million to $60 million annually through 2012. It is possible that technological, regulatory and enforcement developments, the results of environmental studies and other factors could alter our expectations with respect to charges against income and future cash outlays. Specifically, the level of expected cash outlays is highly dependent upon activity related to the former chromium manufacturing plant site in New Jersey, as PPG awaits approval of workplans that have been submitted to the applicable regulatory agencies. Impact of Inflation In 2007, the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation, including the impact of higher raw material costs in our Industrial Coatings reportable segment, was not offset by higher selling prices. Higher selling prices did offset the negative impact of inflation in our Performance Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials reportable segments. However, in our Industrial Coatings, Commodity Chemicals and Glass reportable segments, the negative impact of inflation was not offset by higher selling prices. In 2006, the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation, including the impact of higher raw material costs in our coatings businesses, was offset by higher selling prices in our Industrial Coatings, Performance Coatings and Commodity Chemicals reportable segments and by reduced manufacturing costs in our Glass and Optical and Specialty Materials reportable segments. In 2005, the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation, including the impact of higher coatings raw material costs and higher energy costs in our Glass and Commodity Chemicals businesses were offset by higher selling prices in our Commodity Chemicals and Performance Coatings reportable segments but were not offset by the combination of higher selling prices and lower manufacturing costs in our Industrial Coatings, Optical and Specialty Materials and Glass reportable segments. In 2008, we expect the negative impact of inflation on raw materials, energy and employee benefit costs to slightly exceed the combined impacts of productivity improvements, lower manufacturing costs and higher selling prices. Lower manufacturing costs and productivity improvements are not expected to offset the negative impacts of lower selling prices and inflation, primarily in the cost of raw materials and energy, in our Industrial Coatings and Commodity Chemicals reporting segments. In our remaining reportable segments, the combination of higher selling prices, lower manufacturing costs and productivity improvements is expected to more than offset negative inflationary impacts. Liquidity and Capital Resources During the past three years, we had sufficient financial resources to meet our operating requirements, to fund our capital spending, share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to our shareholders. Cash from operating activities was $996 million, $1,115 million and $1,071 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Capital spending was $584 million, $738 million and $352 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. This spending related to modernization and productivity improvements, expansion of existing businesses, environmental control projects and business acquisitions, which amounted to $231 million, $387 million and $91 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We also assumed $80 million in debt in connection with acquisitions in 2006. Capital spending, excluding acquisitions, is expected to be approximately $470 million during 2008. Total current assets less total current liabilities (net working capital) increased $436 million to $2,475 million at December 31, 2007 from $2,039 million at December 31, 2006. The increase in net working capital is principally related to the $374 million increase in sales in the fourth quarter of 2007 as compared to 2006, the impact of foreign currency translation, the impact of 2007 acquisitions and an increase in the business outside the U.S. where the working capital intensity is greater. Accounts receivable as a percent of annual net sales for 2007 increased to 21.4 percent from 20.4 percent in 2006. Days sales outstanding increased to 72 days in 2007 from 69 days in 2006. Inventories as a percent of annual net sales remained stable at 12.2 percent in 2007 and 2006. Inventory turnover decreased to 5.5 times in 2007 compared to 5.8 times in 2006. 2007 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 27 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis On January 2, 2008, PPG completed the acquisition of SigmaKalon Group (SigmaKalon), a worldwide coatings producer based in Uithoorn, Netherlands, from global private investment firm Bain Capital (the seller). SigmaKalon produces architectural, protective and marine and industrial coatings and is a leading coatings supplier in Europe and other key markets across the globe, with an increasing presence in Africa and Asia. The total transaction value was approximately $3.2 billion, consisting of cash paid to the seller of $1,673 million and debt assumed of $1,517 million. The cash paid to the seller consisted of 717 million ($1,056 million) and $617 million. In order to provide financing for the SigmaKalon acquisition, in December 2007, PPG and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a three year 650 million revolving credit facility with several banks and financial institutions and Societe Generale, as facility agent for the lenders. In addition, PPG and a subsidiary entered into two bridge loan agreements, one in an amount of 1 billion with multiple lenders and Credit Suisse as administrative agent for those lenders and the other in the amount of $500 million with Credit Suisse as the lender. Each bridge loan has a term of 364 days. In December 2007, PPG issued $617 million of commercial paper and borrowed $1,056 million (717 million) under the 1 billion bridge loan agreement. The proceeds from these borrowings were deposited into escrow in December 2007. Upon closing of the acquisition on January 2, 2008, these amounts were released from escrow and paid to the seller. Also in January 2008, PPG borrowed $1,143 million, representing the remaining $417 million (283 million) available under the 1 billion bridge loan agreement and $726 million (493 million) under the 650 million revolving credit facility. The proceeds from these borrowings and cash on hand of $116 million were used to repay $1,259 million of the SigmaKalon debt assumed in the acquisition. No amounts have been borrowed under the $500 million bridge loan agreement. Dividends paid to shareholders totaled $335 million, $316 million and $316 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. PPG has paid uninterrupted dividends since 1899, and 2007 marked the 36th consecutive year of increased dividend payments to shareholders. Over time, our goal is to sustain our dividends at approximately one third of our earnings per share. During 2007, the Company repurchased 3.7 million shares of PPG common stock at a cost of $274 million under a previously authorized share repurchase program. During 2006, the Company repurchased 2.3 million shares of PPG common stock at a cost of $153 million and during 2005, the Company repurchased 9.4 million shares of PPG common stock at a cost of $607 million. Cash contributions to our employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) and related expense were reduced by $30 million in 2007 by the appreciation on old PPG shares purchased prior to December 31, 1992 allocated to participant accounts during 2007. All such shares have been allocated to participants accounts as of December 31, 2007. As such, there will be no corresponding reduction in cash contributions to the ESOP or expense in 2008. On August 17, 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the PPA) was signed into law, changing the funding requirements for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans beginning in 2008. Under current funding requirements, PPG did not have to make a mandatory contribution to our U.S. plans in 2007, and we do not expect to have a mandatory contribution to these plans in 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact that PPA will have on our funding requirements for 2009 and beyond. In 2007, 2006 and 2005 we made voluntary contributions to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans of $100 million, $100 million and $4 million, respectively, and contributions to our non U.S. defined benefit pension plans of $49 million, $24 million and $26 million, respectively, some of which were required by local funding requirements. We expect to make mandatory contributions to our non U.S. plans in 2008 of approximately $62 million and we may make voluntary contributions to our U.S. plans. The ratio of total debt, including capital leases, to total debt and equity was 42% at December 31, 2007 and 28% at December 31, 2006. The increase in 2007 is primarily due to the additional debt borrowed in December to finance the acquisition of SigmaKalon on January 2, 2008. Cash from operations and the Companys debt capacity are expected to continue to be sufficient to fund capital spending, including acquisitions, share repurchases, dividend payments, contributions to pension plans, amounts due under the proposed PPG Settlement Arrangement and operating requirements, including PPGs significant contractual obligations, which are presented in the following table along with amounts due under the proposed PPG Settlement Arrangement: Obligations Due In: (Millions) Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Contractual Obligations Long term debt $ 1,201 $ $ 116 $ 71 $ 1,014 Short term debt 1,818 1,818 Capital lease obligations 1 1 Operating leases 320 91 121 64 44 Interest payments(1) 751 165 140 127 319 Pension contributions(2) 62 62 Unrecognized tax benefits(3) 12 12 Unconditional purchase obligations 791 210 167 93 321 Total $ 4,956 $ 2,359 $ 544 $ 355 $ 1,698 28 2007 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis Obligations Due In: (Millions) Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Asbestos Settlement(4) Aggregate cash payments $ 998 $ 450 $ 64 $ 30 $ 454 PPG stock and other 143 143 Total $ 1,141 $ 593 $ 64 $ 30 $ 454 (1) Includes interest on all outstanding debt. Interest for variable rate debt instruments is based on effective rates at December 31, 2007. Interest for fixed rate debt instruments have been adjusted for the impact of interest rate swaps using the effective rate at December 31, 2007. (2) Includes the estimated pension contribution for 2008 only, as PPG is unable to estimate the pension contributions beyond 2008. (3) Excludes $98 million of accrued liability for unrecognized tax benefits as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of settlement. (4) We have recorded an obligation equal to the net present value of the aggregate cash payments, along with the PPG stock and other assets to be contributed to the Asbestos Settlement Trust. However, PPG has no obligation to pay any amounts under this settlement until the Effective Date, as more fully discussed in Note 15, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The unconditional purchase commitments are principally take or pay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials, including industrial gases, natural gas, coal and electricity, consistent with customary industry practice. These also include PPGs commitment to purchase electricity and steam from the RS Cogen joint venture discussed in Note 6, Investments, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. See Note 9, Debt and Bank Credit Agreements and Leases, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit, letters of credit, guarantees and debt covenants. In addition to the amounts available under the lines of credit, the Company has an automatic shelf registration on file with the SEC pursuant to which it may issue, offer and sell from time to time on a continuous or delayed basis any combination of securities in one or more offerings. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Companys off balance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations disclosed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in Note 9, Debt and Bank Credit Arrangements and Leases, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Estimates Management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under Item 8 of this Form 10 K and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate. We believe that the most critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements relate to accounting for contingencies, under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated, and to accounting for pensions, other postretirement benefits, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies. Contingencies, by their nature, relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss. The most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable, to environmental remediation, to pending, impending or overtly threatened litigation against the Company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years. For more information on these matters, see Note 4, Working Capital Detail, Note 13, Income Taxes and Note 15, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works. To accomplish this, extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, turnover, medical costs and discount rates. These assumptions are reviewed annually. See Note 14, Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, under Item 8 for information on these plans and the assumptions used. The discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined by reference to a current yield curve and by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments. The discount rate assumption for 2008 is 6.45% for our U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. A reduction in the discount rate of 50 basis points, with all other assumptions held constant, would increase 2008 net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately $10 million and $5 million, respectively. The expected return on plan assets assumption used in accounting for our pension plans is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future long term investment returns. For 2007, the return on plan assets assumption for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans was 8.5%. We will use the same assumption for 2008. A reduction in the rate of return of 50 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would increase 2008 net periodic pension expense by approximately $13 million. Net periodic benefit cost for our U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans for the year ended December 31, 2005 was calculated using the 2007 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 29 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis GAM 83 mortality table, a commonly used mortality table. In 2006, we began to use RP 2000, a newer and more relevant mortality table to calculate net periodic benefit costs for these plans. This change in the mortality assumption in 2006 increased net periodic benefit costs by approximately $13 million and $4 million for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, respectively. As discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K, the Company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying values. Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows. Based on this testing, none of our goodwill or identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives was impaired as of December 31, 2007. As part of our ongoing financial reporting process, a collaborative effort is undertaken involving PPG managers with functional responsibility for financial, credit, environmental, legal, tax and benefit matters. The results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments on these contingencies and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements. We believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K related to these contingencies, pensions, other postretirement benefits, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate PPG management, although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates. Currency During 2007, the U.S. dollar weakened against certain of the currencies in the countries in which PPG operates, most notably against the euro, the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real. The effects of translating the net assets of PPGs operations denominated in non U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar increased consolidated net assets at December 31, 2007 by $260 million compared to December 31, 2006. In addition, the weaker U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on 2007 pretax earnings of $47 million. During 2006, the U.S. dollar weakened against the currencies of most of the countries in which PPG operates, most notably against the euro, the British pound sterling and the Australian dollar. The effects of translating the net assets of PPGs operations denominated in non U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar increased consolidated net assets by $179 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. In addition, the weaker U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on 2006 pretax earnings of $9 million. The U.S. dollar was weaker than the euro and the British pound sterling for most of the first eight months of 2005 when compared with currency rates of 2004. The U.S. dollar strengthened against these currencies during the last four months of 2005. The effects of translating the net assets of PPGs operations denominated in non U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar decreased consolidated net assets by $215 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The effect of currency rate changes over the course of the year had a net favorable effect on 2005 pretax earnings of $8 million. Forward Looking Statements The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. Managements Discussion and Analysis and other sections of this Annual Report contain forward looking statements that reflect the Companys current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward looking statements are identified by the use of the words aim, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate and other expressions that indicate future events and trends. Any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also, note the following cautionary statements. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the Companys forward looking statements. Such factors include increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors, fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials, the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom, economic and political conditions in international markets, the ability to penetrate existing, developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets, which also depends on economic and political conditions, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates, the impact of environmental regulations, unexpected business disruptions and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation, including litigation that could result if PPGs Settlement Agreement for asbestos claims does not become effective. However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, while the list of factors presented here is considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant 30 2007 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis additional obstacles to the realization of forward looking statements. Consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forward looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties, other factors set forth in Item 1a of this Form 10 K and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk PPG is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and natural gas prices and to changes in PPGs stock price. The Company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks. A detailed description of these exposures and the Companys risk management policies are provided in Note 11, Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Activities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The following disclosures summarize PPGs exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks. Quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible, unfavorable changes in market rates can impact PPGs consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2007 and 2006 were used to hedge PPGs exposure to foreign currency transaction risk. The fair value of these contracts as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 were assets of $0.4 million and $2 million, respectively. The potential reduction in PPGs earnings resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for European currencies and 20% for Asian and South American currencies for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 would have been $0.3 million and $2 million, respectively. In December 2007, PPG borrowed 717 million under the 1 billion bridge loan agreement established in December 2007 to finance a portion of the anticipated acquisition of SigmaKalon. The euro proceeds were converted to $1,056 million and deposited into escrow until the closing of the transaction on January 2, 2008. On the same day the $1,056 million was placed into escrow, the Company entered into a foreign currency forward contract to convert the U.S. dollars back to 717 million. A 10% decline in the value of the euro would have resulted in a decline in the fair value of this forward contract by $106 million, which would have been substantially offset by a gain on the 717 million loan. PPG had non U.S. dollar denominated debt of $1,636 million as of December 31, 2007 and $472 million as of December 31, 2006. A weakening of the U.S. dollar by 10% against European currencies and by 20% against Asian and South American currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately $203 million and $63 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of PPGs interest rate risk. The fair value of the interest rate swaps was an asset of $6 million as of December 31, 2007 and a liability of $7 million as of December 31, 2006. The fair value of these swaps would have decreased by $8 million and $2 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, if variable interest rates increased by 10%. A 10% increase in interest rates in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in Asia and South America would have affected PPGs variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense by approximately $10 million as of December 31, 2007 and $2 million as of December 31, 2006. Further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the Companys fixed rate debt by approximately $48 million and $51 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively; however, such changes would not have had an effect on PPGs annual earnings or cash flows. The fair value of natural gas swap contracts in place as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 was a liability of $8 million and $25 million, respectively. These contracts were entered into to reduce PPGs exposure to higher prices of natural gas. A 10% reduction in the price of natural gas would result in a loss in the fair value of the underlying natural gas swap contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 of approximately $26 million and $23 million, respectively. An equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the Companys exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute PPG stock into an asbestos settlement trust (see Note 11 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Activities and Note 15, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K). The fair value of this instrument as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 was an asset of $18 million and $14 million, respectively. A 10% decrease in PPGs stock price would have reduced the value of this instrument by $6 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. 2007 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 31 Table of Contents
