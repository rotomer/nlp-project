Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Divestiture of Automotive Glass and Services Business During the third quarter of 2007, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its automotive glass and services business to Platinum Equity (Platinum) for approximately $500 million. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of this business were classified as held for sale and the results of operations and cash flows of this business were classified as discontinued operations. In the fourth quarter of 2007, PPG was notified that affiliates of Platinum had filed suit in the Supreme Court of the State 14 2008 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of New York, County of New York, alleging that Platinum was not obligated to consummate the agreement. Platinum also terminated the agreement. PPG has sued Platinum and certain of its affiliates for damages, including the $25 million breakup fee stipulated by the terms of the agreement, based on various alleged actions of the Platinum parties. While the transaction with Platinum was terminated, PPG management remained committed to a sale of the automotive glass and services business and continued to classify its assets and liabilities as held for sale and report its results of operations and cash flows as discontinued operations through the first quarter of 2008. In July 2008, PPG entered into an agreement with affiliates of Kohlberg & Company, LLC, under which PPG would divest the automotive glass and services business to a new company formed by affiliates of Kohlberg. Under the agreement, PPG would receive a minority interest in the new company, and, as such, the accounting requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets for classifying the business as assets held for sale and reporting its results of operations and cash flows as discontinued operations had no longer been met. The assets and liabilities of the business have been classified as held for use in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007, and the results of operations and cash flows of the business through September 30, 2008 have been classified as continuing operations in the Glass reportable segment in the consolidated statements of income and cash flows under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for the three years ended December 31, 2008. In the second quarter of 2008, as a result of the reclassification of the automotive glass and services business to continuing operations, PPG recorded a one time, non cash charge of $17 million ($11 million aftertax) to reflect a catch up of depreciation expense, which was suspended when the business was classified as a discontinued operation. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2008, PPG recorded a charge of $19 million ($12 million aftertax) for special termination benefits and a pension curtailment loss relating to the impact of benefit changes, including accelerated vesting, negotiated as part of the sale. The transaction with affiliates of Kohlberg was completed on September 30, 2008, with PPG receiving total proceeds of $315 million, including $225 million in cash and two 6 year notes totaling $90 million ($60 million at 8.5% interest and $30 million at 10% interest). Both notes, which may be prepaid at any time without penalty, are senior to the equity of the new company. In addition, PPG has received a minority interest of approximately 40 percent in the new company, Pittsburgh Glass Works LLC. This transaction resulted in a third quarter 2008 gain of $15 million pretax, net of transaction costs, and is included in Other income in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2008 under Item 8. The aftertax gain on the transaction was $3 million, reflective of tax expense of $12 million. Tax expense on the gain includes the tax cost of repatriating certain transaction proceeds from Canada to the U.S. and the impact of certain permanent book/tax differences which resulted in a larger taxable gain. PPG will account for its interest in Pittsburgh Glass Works LLC under the equity method of accounting from October 1, 2008 onward. PPG has retained certain liabilities for pension and post employment benefits earned for service up to September 30, 2008. Divestiture of Fine Chemicals Business In the third quarter of 2007, PPG entered into an agreement to sell its fine chemicals business to ZaCh System S.p.A., a subsidiary of Zambon Company S.p.A., for approximately $65 million. The sale of this business was completed in November 2007. The results of operations and cash flows of this business, which had previously been included in the Optical and Specialty Materials reportable segment, have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and cash flows under Item 8 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. PPG recorded a pretax loss on sale of the fine chemicals business of $25 million ($19 million aftertax) in 2007. Performance in 2008 compared with 2007 Performance Overview Our sales increased 30% to $15.8 billion in 2008 compared to $12.2 billion in 2007. Sales increased 28% due to the impact of acquisitions, 4% due to increased selling prices and 2% due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation. These sales increases were offset by a 2% decline due to lower sales volumes and by a 2% decline related to the automotive glass and services business divestiture. Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased by $2,327 million in 2008 to $10,155 million compared to $7,828 million in 2007. This increase corresponds with the increase in sales. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 64.1% in both 2008 and 2007. Cost of sales in 2008 includes $94 million for the flow through cost of sales of the step up to fair value of acquired inventory related to the SigmaKalon acquisition. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $1,122 million in 2008 due principally to the impact of the acquisition of SigmaKalon. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 21.7% for 2008 compared to 18.9% for 2007. The increase 2008 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 15 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was due largely to the addition of SigmaKalon and reflects the distribution nature of these businesses, which requires higher selling, distribution, advertising and regional management costs to serve their broad customer profile. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in the Architectural Coatings EMEA reportable segment are in line with PPGs other architectural coatings businesses. Other factors causing the increase in these expenses were higher levels of cost to support growth in our coatings and optical businesses, higher bad debt expense associated with the impact of the weakening economy on our customers, a second quarter charge of $19 million for special termination benefits and foreign currency translation. Depreciation expense increased by $83 million due primarily to the acquisition of SigmaKalon. Research and development costs increased by $103 million and amortization increased by $77 million compared to 2007. These increases were primarily due to the acquisition of SigmaKalon. Interest expense increased by $161 million in 2008 due to debt incurred to finance the acquisition of SigmaKalon. During the third quarter of 2008, the Company finalized a restructuring plan that is part of implementing PPGs global transformation strategy and the integration of its acquisition of SigmaKalon. The Company recorded a charge of $163 million for the cost of this restructuring. The effective tax rate on pretax earnings from continuing operations in 2008 was 31.3% compared to 29.1% in 2007. The 2008 rate includes a tax benefit of $14 million related to the settlement with the Internal Revenue Service of our U.S. tax returns for tax years 2004, 2005 and 2006. The 2008 rate also includes a total net tax benefit of 26.5% on costs related to the acquisition of SigmaKalon, the charges for the catch up of depreciation expense and the impact of benefit changes related to the divestiture of the automotive glass and services business, the business restructuring charge, the adjustment to increase the current value of the Companys obligation under the proposed asbestos settlement, as discussed in Note 15, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities under Item 8 of this Form 10 K, and the gain on divestiture of the automotive glass and services business. The tax rate was 31.3% on the remaining pretax earnings in 2008. The rate in 2007 includes the benefit of $15 million for the reversal of a valuation allowance previously recorded against the benefit of a tax net operating loss carryforward, the benefit associated with an enacted reduction in the Canadian federal corporate income tax rate and a tax benefit of 39% on the adjustment to increase the current value of the Companys obligation under the proposed asbestos settlement. The tax rate was 30.5% on the remaining pretax earnings from continuing operations in 2007. The effective tax rate on pretax earnings from discontinued operations in 2007 was 25.2%. This rate includes a tax benefit of 24% on the loss on the sale of the fine chemicals business. The tax rate was 36.5% on the remaining pretax earnings from discontinued operations in 2007. Net income and earnings per share assuming dilution for 2008 and 2007 are summarized below: (Millions, except per share amounts) Year ended December 31, 2008 Net Income $ EPS Net income $ 538 $ 3.25 Net income includes: Charges related to: Business restructuring 110 0.67 Acquisition related costs(1) 89 0.54 Depreciation catch up(2) 11 0.07 Divestiture related benefit costs(3) 12 0.07 Asbestos settlement net(4) 2 0.01 Gain on divestiture of automotive glass and services business (3) (0.02) (Millions, except per share amounts) Year ended December 31, 2007 Net Income $ EPS Net income $ 834 $ 5.03 Net income includes: Charges related to: Asbestos settlement net(4) 15 0.09 Acquisition related costs(5) 4 0.03 Divestiture related benefit costs(6) 11 0.06 Loss on divestiture of fine chemicals business 19 0.11 (1) Costs related to SigmaKalon acquisition, including $66 million aftertax for the flow through cost of sales of the step up to fair value of acquired inventory and $23 million aftertax for the write off of in process research and development.

Sales increased 21% due to acquisitions, largely due to the impact of the SigmaKalon protective and marine coatings business. Sales also grew by 3% due to higher selling prices and 2% due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation. Sales volumes declined 2% as reduced volumes in architectural coatings Americas and Asia Pacific and automotive refinish were not fully offset by improved volumes in the aerospace and protective and marine businesses. Volume growth in the aerospace businesses occurred throughout the world, while the volume growth in protective and marine coatings occurred primarily in Asia. Segment income increased $19 million in 2008. Factors increasing segment income were the positive impact of acquisitions, lower overhead costs and the positive impact of foreign currency translation. The benefit of higher selling prices more than offset the negative impact of inflation, including higher raw materials and benefit costs. Segment income was reduced by the impact of the lower sales volumes in architectural coatings and automotive refinish, which more than offset the benefit of volume gains in the aerospace and protective and marine coatings businesses. Industrial Coatings sales increased $353 million or 10% in 2008. Sales increased 11% due to acquisitions, including the impact of the SigmaKalon industrial coatings business. Sales also grew 3% due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation, and 1% from higher selling prices. Sales volumes declined 5% as reduced volumes were experienced in all three businesses, reflecting the substantial declines in global demand. Volume declines in the automotive and industrial businesses were primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Additional volume declines in the European and Asian regions were experienced by the industrial coatings business. In packaging coatings, volume declines in Europe were only partially offset by gains in Asia and North America. Segment income declined $158 million in 2008 due to the lower volumes and inflation, including higher raw material and freight costs, the impact of which was only partially mitigated by the increased selling prices. Segment income also declined due to higher selling and distribution costs, including higher bad debt expense. Factors increasing segment income were the earnings of acquired businesses, the positive impact of foreign currency translation and lower manufacturing costs. Architectural Coatings EMEA sales for the year were $2,249 million. This business was acquired in the SigmaKalon acquisition. Segment income was $141 million, which included amortization expense of $63 million related to acquired intangible assets and depreciation expense of $58 million. Optical and Specialty Materials sales increased $105 million or 10% in 2008. Sales increased 5% due to higher volumes in our optical products business resulting from the launch of Transitions Opticals next generation lens product, 3% due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation and 2% due to increased selling prices. Segment income increased $9 million in 2008. The increase in segment income was the result of increased sales volumes and the favorable impact of currency partially offset by increased selling and marketing costs in the optical products business related to the Transitions Optical product launch mentioned above. Increased selling prices only partially offset higher raw material costs, primarily in our silicas business. Commodity Chemicals sales increased $298 million or 19% in 2008. Sales increased 18% due to higher selling prices and 1% due to improved sales volumes. Segment income increased $97 million in 2008. Segment income increased in large part due to higher selling prices, which more than offset the negative impact of inflation, primarily higher raw material and energy costs. Segment income also improved due to lower manufacturing costs, while lower margin mix and equity earnings reduced segment income. Glass sales decreased $281 million or 13% in 2008. Sales decreased 11% due to the divestiture of the automotive glass and services business in September 2008 and 4% due to lower sales volumes. Sales increased 2% due to higher selling prices. Segment income decreased $68 million in 2008. Segment income decreased due to the divestiture of the automotive glass and services business, lower volumes, the negative impact of inflation and lower equity earnings from our Asian fiber glass joint ventures. Factors increasing segment income were lower manufacturing costs, higher selling prices and stronger foreign currency. Outlook Overall global economic activity was volatile in 2008 with an overall downward trend. The North American economy continued a slowing trend which began during the second half of 2006 and continued all of 2007. The impact of the weakening U.S. economy was particularly 2008 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 17 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis evident in lower automotive production, housing starts and consumer confidence. Many economies in other regions were stable early in 2008 but then began to slow during the year, with nearly all global economies slowing rapidly in the fourth quarter. The significance of access to credit and overall liquidity concerns increased as the year progressed, triggering intervention by many governments to provide interim financial aid to the global banking system and to lower interest rates and implement other measures intended to stimulate economic activity. Industrial end markets experienced rapid declines in the fourth quarter, as global demand dropped reflecting a deepening U.S. recession and the spread of the banking crisis and recessionary conditions to many European, Asian and Latin American economies. Early in 2008, global inflation intensified as oil prices accelerated to all time highs. These inflationary trends continued well into the third quarter, driving up costs of other energy sources and many of the products that are dependent upon energy as a feedstock. Then, in recognition of the global economic slowing, prices of energy and many related commodities declined in the latter part of the year. The North American economy continued to slow during the year. Residential construction continued to decline, while rising unemployment, high levels of mortgage foreclosures and real estate pricing declines were among the primary causal factors of the ongoing banking crisis. Industrial output sagged, with the U.S. automotive OEM market declining the most of any of the major industrial markets. By year end, declines in many industrial end markets exceeded 10 percent, with several declining 20 30 percent. The declining economic environment resulted in a continued upward shift of the U.S. unemployment rate and a decline in consumer confidence to all time lows. The European economy was more stable early in the year, with softness beginning to appear in a few countries such as Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom. Most of the remaining parts of Western Europe began to experience similar declines to the U.S. later in the year. Eastern European growth once again outpaced growth in Western Europe, with most countries continuing to grow throughout the year, albeit at declining rates. However, several countries, including Hungary, Poland and Russia began to experience economic decline stemming from either the spread of the banking crisis or the drop in commodity pricing. The Asian economies continued to post very high growth rates well into the year, but the impact of the decline in the U.S. and European economies eventually led to declines in the Asian growth rates late in the year. Overall, China GDP grew to the point that China now represents the third largest economy globally, but even this growth rate fell below 10 percent for the first time in over five years. Entering 2009, the overall economic outlook is uncertain and extremely bearish. Many economists believe the U.S. will experience its worst recession in at least 50 years, with other major regional economies possibly following suit. As a result, we expect the 2008 inflationary pressures on our input cost to, at least in part, reverse. The Company is anticipating a generally stronger U.S. dollar in 2009 resulting in negative sales and earnings impacts relating to translation of the sales and earnings from our foreign affiliates compared to 2008. Pension and postretirement benefit costs will increase in 2009 due largely to the significant declines in plan assets due to 2008 investment performance. Our pension and postretirement benefit costs totaled $258 million in 2008, including charges of $34 million related to plan changes stemming from the divestiture of the automotive glass and services business and our 2008 restructuring actions. Based on our current estimates, we expect our ongoing pension and other postretirement benefits costs to increase by approximately $100 $125 million in 2009. Our natural gas costs in 2008 were volatile and on average increased by almost 25 percent in the U.S. as compared to 2007. Changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the operating performance of our Commodity Chemicals and Glass businesses. Each one dollar change in our price of natural gas per million British thermal units (mmbtu) has a direct impact of $60 million to $70 million on our annual operating costs. Our 2008 natural gas costs averaged over $9.00 per mmbtu for the year, while our 2007 costs averaged about $7.25. While it remains difficult to predict future natural gas prices, in order to reduce the risks associated with volatile prices, we use a variety of techniques, which include reducing consumption through improved manufacturing processes, switching to alternative fuels and hedging. We currently estimate our cost for natural gas in the first quarter of 2009 will be lower than the first quarter of 2008. We currently have about 50% of our first quarter 2009 U.S. natural gas purchases hedged at a price of about $8.50, and approximately 50% of our 2009 U.S. annual requirements hedged at about $8.00. The current spot price for natural gas is about $5.00. In the past year, we experienced increases in the prices we pay for raw materials used in many of our businesses, particularly in our coatings businesses. The increases have resulted from global industrial expansion, supply/demand imbalance and increases in supplier feedstock costs. We have and plan to continue to combat the impact of these rising costs by seeking alternate and global supply sources for our raw materials, reformulating our products, 18 2008 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis improving our production processes and raising our selling prices. Year over year coatings raw material costs rose by about $150 million in 2008, or about a 5 percent increase, up notably from 2007 which increased by about $40 million or 1 percent. Our current forecast for the early portion of 2009 is for the cost of certain raw materials to decline, resulting from the delayed impact of lower oil prices and lower global demand for the materials we purchase. We also expect a negative impact on our margins in the United Kingdom, Eastern Europe, and Latin America, where raw materials are purchased in currencies that are expected to be stronger than the local currencies. About 30% of our coatings sales in Europe are made outside the Eurozone. Given the dynamic supply/demand, energy cost and currency environment, it is not feasible to project full year raw material pricing, but the main drivers will continue to be overall economic conditions and resulting supply and demand factors. The combination of a tight supply position for caustic and high energy costs resulted in chlor alkali pricing that ended 2008 at an all time record high and pricing for the fourth quarter that was up 20% over the prior year. Chlor alkali demand was strong at the beginning of the fourth quarter following the adverse impact of third quarter hurricanes on industrial activity in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Demand softened in November and December and we are anticipating that early 2009 demand levels will be less than in the fourth quarter. We completed significant portfolio changes in 2008 that have been crucial in the transformation of the Company. We completed the acquisition of SigmaKalon. The total transaction value was approximately $3.2 billion, consisting of cash paid of $1,673 million and debt assumed of $1,517 million. We also completed a few other targeted acquisitions at a cost totaling nearly $140 million. As in past years, these acquisitions are intended to strengthen our coatings businesses by extending their geographic breadth and or product offering. The sales for businesses held for less than one year added approximately $3.4 billion to PPGs 2008 sales with mid single digit operating margins, excluding certain one time acquisition related costs and including amortization expense stemming from the acquisitions, which amortization totaled $79 million. Interim financing from the SigmaKalon acquisition was replaced with permanent financing in March 2008, as PPG placed term debt with five, ten and thirty year maturities at a cost of 5.75%, 6.65% and 7.70% respectively, which we believe is favorable to the cost of placing that debt today. Also in 2008, we completed the divestiture of a majority interest in the automotive glass and services business. We retained about a 40 percent interest in the business and will account for this interest using the equity method of accounting. The weak economic conditions that are adversely impacting our continuing businesses that serve the automotive OEM market are also significantly impacting this divested business. The Company announced restructuring actions in the third quarter of 2008 focused on reducing its cost structure, including actions associated with achieving the synergies from the integration of the acquired SigmaKalon business and in reflection of the lower demand levels. We are considering additional cost reduction actions which may result in additional restructuring charges and related cost savings in 2009. Global economic conditions entering 2009 are extremely challenging due to continued lack of industrial demand and global credit issues. The transformation of the Company, including the 2008 portfolio changes, has enhanced our geographic sales mix, as now only about 45 percent of sales are derived in the U.S. and Canada, and emerging regions account for nearly 25 percent of sales. Additionally, we have broadened our end markets served resulting in lower exposure to any individual end market. Entering the year, we have $1 billion of cash on hand following record cash generation in 2008. We anticipate that our increased diversification and our cash and existing borrowing capacity will provide the Company with the liquidity it needs to finance operations and reward shareholders in 2009, even in the face of todays weakened global economy and the possibility that the recovery does not begin until 2010.

Sales increased 6% due to the impact of acquisitions, 3% due to increased volumes and 3% due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased slightly to 64.1% compared to 63.6% in 2006 due to the adverse impact of inflation net of selling price changes. Selling, general and administrative expense increased slightly as a percentage of sales to 18.9% compared to 18.1% in 2006. These costs increased primarily due to higher expenses related to growth, including increased advertising costs and the impact of inflation. Business restructuring expense decreased $37 million in 2007. In 2006, the Company finalized plans for certain actions to reduce its workforce and consolidate facilities and recorded a charge of $37 million. Other charges decreased $195 million in 2007. The reduction was primarily due to a reduction in environmental expenses, which were $195 million lower in 2007 as compared to 2006. Other earnings increased $18 million in 2007 due to higher royalty income, higher interest income and gains from asset sales. The effective tax rate on pretax earnings from continuing operations in 2007 was 29.1% compared to 26.1% in 2006. The rate in 2007 included the benefit of $15 million for the reversal of a valuation allowance previously recorded against the benefit of a tax net operating loss carryforward, the benefit associated with an enacted reduction in the Canadian federal corporate income tax rate and a tax benefit of 39% on the adjustment to increase the current value of the Companys obligation under the proposed asbestos settlement. The tax rate was 30.5% on the remaining pretax earnings from continuing operations in 2007. The effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations in 2006 included the benefit of a tax refund from Canada resulting from the favorable resolution of a tax dispute dating back to 1998 and a tax benefit related to the settlement with the Internal Revenue Service of our tax returns for the years 2001 2003. In the aggregate, these benefits reduced 2006 income tax expense by $39 million. The 2006 effective tax rate also included a tax benefit of 36% on the charge for business restructuring and a tax benefit of 39% on the third quarter environmental remediation charge for sites in New Jersey and Louisiana, on the charges for legal settlements, and on the adjustment to increase the current value of the Companys obligation under the proposed asbestos settlement. Income tax expense of 39% was recognized on certain insurance recoveries, and income tax expense of 29.4% was recognized on the remaining pretax earnings from continuing operations in 2006. The effective tax rate on pretax earnings from discontinued operations in 2007 was 25.2% compared to 39% in 2006. The rate in 2007 included a tax benefit of 24% on the loss on the sale of the fine chemicals business. The tax rate was 36.5% on the remaining pretax earnings from discontinued operations in 2007. Net income and earnings per share assuming dilution for 2007 and 2006 are summarized below: ($ in Millions, except per share amounts) Year ended December 31, 2007 Net Income $ EPS Net income $ 834 $ 5.03 Net income includes: Charges related to: Acquisition relatedcosts(1) 4 0.03 Asbestos settlement net(2) 15 0.09 Divestiture related benefit costs(3) 11 0.06 Loss on divestiture of fine chemicals business 19 0.11 ($ in Millions, except per share amounts) Year ended December 31, 2006 Net Income $ EPS Net income $ 711 $ 4.27 Net income includes: Charges related to: Environmental remediation(4) 106 0.64 Legal settlements 26 0.15 Business restructuring 23 0.14 Asbestos settlement net(2) 17 0.10 Earnings from insurance recoveries (24 ) (0.14 ) (1) Costs related to Barloworld Coatings Australia acquisition for the flow through cost of sales of the step up to fair value of acquired inventory.

Sales increased 15% due to sales from acquisitions in all Performance Coatings businesses, 4% due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation 20 2008 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis and 3% due to improved sales volumes in our aerospace and automotive refinish businesses, which more than offset slightly lower volumes in architectural coatings. The volume growth in the aerospace and refinish businesses occurred throughout the world, while the volume decline in architectural coatings was in North America. Sales also increased 1% due to higher selling prices. Segment income increased $49 million to a total of $563 million in 2007. Factors increasing segment income were improved sales volumes, earnings from acquisitions and the positive impact of foreign currency translation. Additionally, the benefit of higher selling prices more than offset the impact of inflation. Segment income decreased due to higher overhead costs to support growth initiatives in this segment. Industrial Coatings sales increased $410 million or 13% in 2007. Sales increased 6% due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation, 4% due to acquisitions in our automotive and industrial coatings businesses and 3% from improved sales volumes as volume increases in automotive coatings and packaging coatings more than offset declines in the volume of the industrial coatings business in the U.S. and Canada. Volume growth in the automotive coatings business occurred in all regions of the world, while the volume growth in packaging coatings was experienced mainly in Asia and Europe. The decline in industrial coatings North American volumes overshadowed solid growth for this business in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Segment income increased $21 million in 2007 due to improved sales volumes, the impact of acquisitions, lower manufacturing costs and the positive impact of foreign currency translation. Factors decreasing segment income were inflation, including higher raw material costs, which more than offset a slight improvement in selling prices, and increased overhead costs to support growth initiatives. Optical and Specialty Materials sales increased $125 million or 14% in 2007. Sales increased 8% due to higher volumes primarily in the optical products business, 4% due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation, 1% as the result of sales from acquisitions in the optical products business and 1% due to higher selling prices. Segment income increased $18 million in 2007. The increase in segment income was primarily the result of the increased sales volumes partially offset by higher advertising expense related to optical products volume growth initiatives in all regions and to the impending launch of Transitions Opticals next generation lens product in the first quarter of 2008. Commodity Chemicals sales increased $56 million or 4% in 2007. Sales increased 9% due to higher sales volumes of caustic and derivatives, which was partially offset by a 5% decrease in selling prices in part due to lower natural gas input costs. Segment income decreased $42 million in 2007. Segment income was lower in large part due to lower selling prices, higher manufacturing costs, including maintenance costs and higher raw material costs. Segment income also decreased as a result of the absence of an insurance recovery received in 2006 for damage caused by Hurricane Rita in 2005. The benefit of lower energy and environmental costs and improved sales volumes were factors that increased segment income in 2007. Glass sales decreased by $32 million or 1% in 2007. Sales decreased 1% due to lower sales volumes in our automotive glass and services business and 1% due to the negative impact of lower selling prices primarily in our performance glazings business. Pricing in the performance glazings business includes a surcharge related to the cost of energy lagged by one quarter. The surcharge in 2006 exceeded the 2007 surcharge due to higher energy costs during the comparable periods. Sales increased by 1% due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation. Segment income decreased $10 million in 2007. Segment income decreased due to the negative impact of inflation and lower pricing, including the lower energy surcharge in performance glazings. These factors were only partially offset by the benefit from lower manufacturing and selling costs. See Note 24, Reportable Business Segment Information, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further information related to the Companys operating segments and reportable business segments. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, including Environmental Matters PPG is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against others, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Note 15, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for a description of certain of these lawsuits, including a description of the proposed asbestos settlement and a description of the antitrust suits against PPG related to the flat glass and automotive refinish industries. As discussed in Item 3 and Note 15, although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable, management believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving PPG, including asbestos related claims in the event the proposed asbestos settlement described in Note 15 does not become effective, will not have a material effect on PPGs consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. 2008 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 21 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis It is PPGs policy to accrue expenses for environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted. Management anticipates that the resolution of the Companys environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, PPG had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling $299 million and $276 million, respectively, of which $44 million and $57 million, respectively, were classified as current liabilities. Pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2008, 2007 and 2006 totaled $15 million, $12 million and $207 million, respectively, and are included in Other charges in the consolidated statement of income. Cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated $24 million, $19 million and $22 million, in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. As part of the allocation of the SigmaKalon purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the reserve for environmental contingencies was increased by $37 million in 2008. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased the liability by $5 million in 2008. In addition to the amounts currently reserved for environmental remediation, the Company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as $200 million to $300 million, which range is unchanged since December 31, 2007. Such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence. Charges for estimated environmental remediation costs in 2006 were significantly higher than our historical range. Our continuing efforts to analyze and assess the environmental issues associated with a former chromium manufacturing plant site located in Jersey City, N.J., and at the Calcasieu River Estuary located near our Lake Charles, La., chlor alkali plant resulted in a pre tax charge of $173 million in the third quarter of 2006 for the estimated costs of remediating these sites. Excluding 2006, pretax charges against income have ranged between $10 million and $49 million per year for the past 15 years. We anticipate that charges against income in 2009 for environmental remediation costs will be within this historical range. Management expects cash outlays for environmental remediation costs to be approximately $50 million in 2009 and to range from $45 million to $75 million annually through 2013. It is possible that technological, regulatory and enforcement developments, the results of environmental studies and other factors could alter our expectations with respect to charges against income and future cash outlays. Specifically, the level of expected cash outlays is highly dependent upon activity related to the former chromium manufacturing plant site in New Jersey, as PPG awaits approval of workplans that have been submitted to the applicable regulatory agencies. Impact of Inflation In 2008, PPG was able to more than offset the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation, including the impact of higher raw materials and energy costs, with increased selling prices. In our Commodity Chemicals reportable segment, the increase in our costs due to inflation was more than offset by higher selling prices. In our Performance Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials reportable segments, the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation was offset by higher selling prices. However, in our Industrial Coatings and Glass reportable segments, the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation was not offset by higher selling prices. In 2007, the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation, including the impact of higher raw material costs in our Industrial Coatings, Commodity Chemicals and Glass reportable segments, were not offset by higher selling prices. Higher selling prices did offset the negative impact of inflation in our Performance Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials reportable segments. In 2006, the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation, including the impact of higher raw material costs in our coatings businesses, was offset by higher selling prices in our Industrial Coatings, Performance Coatings and Commodity Chemicals reportable segments and by reduced manufacturing costs in our Glass and Optical and Specialty Materials reportable segments. In 2009, we expect that the combined impact of productivity improvements, lower manufacturing costs and higher selling prices will offset any negative impact of inflation on raw materials, energy and other costs. We expect erosion in the cost of certain raw materials in some regions of the world in the beginning of 2009, resulting from the delayed impact of lower oil prices and lower global demand for these raw materials. However, our forecast for raw material inflation remains uncertain for the full year 2009 given the current economic uncertainty and the volatility in commodity and raw material costs we experienced in 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources During the past three years, we had sufficient financial resources to meet our operating requirements, to fund our capital spending, share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to our shareholders. Cash from operating activities was $1,358 million, $996 million and $1,115 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, 22 2008 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis respectively. The increase in cash from operations in 2008 compared to 2007 of $362 million was due in large part to an increase in earnings after adjustment for non cash charges for amortization, depreciation, SigmaKalon acquired inventory step up and in process research and development costs and business restructuring and to less growth in working capital. The major factors contributing to these higher year over year earnings were the earnings from the acquired SigmaKalon business and higher Commodity Chemicals earnings. Our strong 2008 performance in terms of cash from operating activities has enabled us to repay $681 million of debt during the year and still have over $1 billion of cash on hand at December 31, 2008. Our debt reduction activity has lowered our U.S. commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2008 to $222 million. The credit crisis in the U.S. drove up our cost of borrowing in the commercial paper market late in 2008 by about 300 basis points compared to our cost earlier in 2008, shortened the term of our commercial paper borrowings and effectively reduced the amount of credit available to us in this market from time to time; however, our strong cash position and other available credit facilities were sufficient to fund the shortfall we experienced in terms of commercial paper availability in 2008. In the early part of 2009, our cost of borrowing in the commercial paper market has declined by about 400 basis points, and the amount of credit available to us in this market has returned to a more normal level. Total current assets less total current liabilities (net working capital) decreased $171 million to $2,138 million at December 31, 2008 from $2,309 million at December 31, 2007. The decrease in net working capital is principally related to the change in net short term borrowings and the growth in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, offset with increases in accounts receivable and inventory driven by acquisitions and an increase in cash due to our cash flow focus in the fourth quarter of 2008. Accounts receivable as a percent of annual sales for 2008 decreased to 17.7 percent from 20.6 percent in 2007. Days sales outstanding decreased to 65 days in 2008 from 75 days in 2007. Inventories as a percent of annual sales decreased to 10.7 percent from 12.5 percent in 2007. Inventory turnover was 5 times in 2008 and 2007. Total capital spending was $2,056 million, $597 million and $771 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Spending related to modernization and productivity improvements, expansion of existing businesses and environmental control projects was $383 million, $364 million and $369 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and is expected to be approximately $200 million during 2009. Capital spending related to business acquisitions amounted to $1,673 million, $233 million and $402 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. On January 2, 2008, PPG completed the acquisition of SigmaKalon, a worldwide coatings producer based in Uithoorn, Netherlands, from global private investment firm Bain Capital (the seller). SigmaKalon produces architectural, protective and marine and industrial coatings and is a leading coatings supplier in Europe and other key markets across the globe, with an increasing presence in Africa and Asia. The total transaction value was approximately $3.2 billion, consisting of cash paid to the seller of $1,673 million and debt assumed of $1,517 million. In order to provide financing for the SigmaKalon acquisition, in December 2007, PPG and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a three year 650 million revolving credit facility with several banks and financial institutions and Societe Generale, as facility agent for the lenders. The facility has an annual fee of 7 basis points. In addition, PPG and a subsidiary entered into two bridge loan agreements, one in the amount of 1 billion with multiple lenders and Credit Suisse as administrative agent for those lenders and the other in the amount of $500 million with Credit Suisse as the lender. In December 2007, PPG issued $617 million of commercial paper and borrowed $1,056 million (717 million) under the 1 billion bridge loan agreement. The proceeds from these borrowings were deposited into escrow in December 2007. Upon closing of the acquisition on January 2, 2008, these amounts were released from escrow and paid to the seller. Also, in January 2008, PPG borrowed $1,143 million, representing the remaining $417 million (283 million) available under the 1 billion bridge loan agreement and $726 million (493 million) under the 650 million revolving credit facility. The proceeds from these borrowings and cash on hand of $116 million were used to refinance $1,259 million of the $1,517 million of SigmaKalon debt outstanding on the date of acquisition. No amounts were borrowed under the $500 million bridge loan agreement and, due to the passage of time and the specific purpose of this agreement, PPG can no longer make borrowings under this agreement. On March 18, 2008, PPG completed a public offering of $600 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.75% Notes due 2013 (the 2013 Notes), $700 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.65% Notes due 2018 (the 2018 Notes) and $250 million in aggregate principal amount of its 7.70% Notes due 2038 (the 2038 Notes and, together with the 2013 Notes and the 2018 Notes, the Notes). The Notes were offered by the Company pursuant to its existing shelf registration. The proceeds of this offering of $1,538 million (net of discount and issuance costs) and additional borrowings of $195 million under the 650 million revolving credit 2008 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 23 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis facility were used to repay existing debt, including certain short term debt and the amounts outstanding under the 1 billion bridge loan. No further amounts can be borrowed under the 1 billion bridge loan. The discount and issuance costs related to the Notes, which totaled $12 million, will be amortized to interest expense over the respective lives of the Notes. In the fourth quarter 2008, the Company monetized certain cross currency foreign exchange swap contracts, which had been designated as hedges of our Euro denominated net investment in SigmaKalon, and replaced them with new swap contracts. As a result of these swap monetizations, the Company received $208 million in cash proceeds. See Item 7a of this Form 10 K for further information regarding these instruments. In July 2008, the Company entered into an agreement to divest its automotive OEM glass and automotive replacement glass and services businesses (automotive glass and services business). Under the agreement, PPG received a minority ownership interest in the new company formed by the buyer. The transaction was completed on September 30, 2008. The Company received proceeds of $225 million from this transaction. Dividends paid to shareholders totaled $343 million, $335 million and $316 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. PPG has paid uninterrupted dividends since 1899, and 2008 marked the 37th consecutive year of increased annual dividend payments to shareholders. Over time, our goal is to sustain our dividends at approximately one third of our earnings per share. During 2008, the Company repurchased 0.1 million shares of PPG common stock at a cost of $7 million under a previously authorized share repurchase program. In 2007, the Company purchased 3.7 million shares of PPG common stock at a cost of $274 million, and during 2006, the Company repurchased 2.3 million shares of PPG common stock at a cost of $153 million. On August 17, 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the PPA) was signed into law, changing the funding requirements for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans beginning in 2008. Under the requirements of PPA, we did not have a mandatory contribution to these plans in 2008; however, we made a voluntary contribution of $50 million to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2008. We do not currently expect to have a mandatory contribution to these plans in 2009; however, due in large part to the negative investment return on pension plan assets in 2008, we made a voluntary contribution in the amount of $160 million to these plans in January 2009 and we may make additional voluntary contributions to these plans in 2009 in an amount up to $140 million. In both 2007 and 2006, we made voluntary contributions to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans of $100 million. Contributions were made to our non U.S. defined benefit pension plans of $69 million, $49 million and $24 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, some of which were required by local funding requirements. We expect to make contributions to our non U.S. plans in 2009 of approximately $60 million, all of which are mandatory. The ratio of total debt, including capital leases, to total debt and equity was 54% at December 31, 2008 and 42% at December 31, 2007. The increase in 2008 is primarily due to the additional debt borrowed to finance the acquisition of SigmaKalon combined with a reduction in equity driven by currency and pension adjustments to other comprehensive income (loss). We continue to believe that our cash on hand, cash from operations and the Companys available debt capacity will continue to be sufficient to fund operating activities, capital spending, including acquisitions, dividend payments, debt service, amounts due under the proposed asbestos settlement, share repurchases, contributions to pension plans, and PPGs significant contractual obligations. These significant contractual obligations, along with amounts due under the proposed asbestos settlement are presented in the following table. Obligations Due In: (Millions) Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Contractual Obligations Long term debt $ 3,122 $ 117 $ 378 $ 676 $ 1,951 Short term debt 784 784 Capital lease obligations 6 2 1 1 2 Operating leases 633 126 189 116 202 Interest payments(1) 1,776 188 331 306 951 Pension contributions(2) 220 220 Unconditional purchase obligations 1,220 374 403 101 342 Total $ 7,761 $ 1,811 $ 1,302 $ 1,200 $ 3,448 Asbestos Settlement(3) Aggregate cash payments $ 825 $ 417 $ 29 $ 33 $ 346 PPG stock and other 74 74 Total $ 899 $ 491 $ 29 $ 33 $ 346 (1) Includes interest on all outstanding debt. Interest for variable rate debt instruments is based on effective rates at December 31, 2008. Interest for fixed rate debt instruments have been adjusted for the impact of interest rate swaps using the effective rate at December 31, 2008. (2) Includes the estimated pension contribution for 2009 only, as PPG is unable to estimate the pension contributions beyond 2009. (3) We have recorded an obligation equal to the net present value of the aggregate cash payments, along with the PPG stock and other assets to be contributed to a trust under the proposed asbestos settlement. However, PPG has no obligation to pay any amounts under this settlement until the Funding Effective Date, as more fully discussed in Note 15, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 24 2008 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis The unconditional purchase commitments are principally take or pay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials, including industrial gases, natural gas, coal and electricity, consistent with customary industry practice. These amounts also include PPGs commitment to purchase electricity and steam from the RS Cogen joint venture discussed in Note 6, Investments, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. See Note 9, Debt and Bank Credit Agreements and Leases, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit, letters of credit, guarantees and debt covenants. In addition to the amounts available under the lines of credit, the Company has an automatic shelf registration on file with the SEC pursuant to which it may issue, offer and sell from time to time on a continuous or delayed basis any combination of securities in one or more offerings. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Companys off balance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations disclosed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in Note 9, Debt and Bank Credit Agreements and Leases, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Estimates Management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under Item 8 of this Form 10 K and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate. We believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies, under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated, and to accounting for pensions, other postretirement benefits, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies. Contingencies, by their nature, relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss. The most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable, to environmental remediation, to pending, impending or overtly threatened litigation against the Company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years. For more information on these matters, see Note 4, Working Capital Detail, Note 13, Income Taxes and Note 15, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works. To accomplish this, extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, turnover, medical costs and discount rates. These assumptions are reviewed annually. See Note 14, Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, under Item 8 for information on these plans and the assumptions used. The discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined by reference to a current yield curve and by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments. The discount rate assumption for 2009 is 6.15% for our U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. A reduction in the discount rate of 50 basis points, with all other assumptions held constant, would increase 2009 net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately $9 million and $5 million, respectively. The expected return on plan assets assumption used in accounting for our pension plans is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future long term investment returns. For 2008, the return on plan assets assumption for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans was 8.5%. We will use the same assumption for 2009. A reduction in the rate of return of 50 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would increase 2009 net periodic pension expense by approximately $10 million. As discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K, the Company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying values. Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows. Based on this testing, none of our goodwill or identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives was impaired as of December 31, 2008. As part of our ongoing financial reporting process, a collaborative effort is undertaken involving PPG managers with functional responsibility for financial, credit, environmental, legal, tax and benefit matters. The results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments on these contingencies and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements. 2008 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 25 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis We believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K related to these contingencies, pensions, other postretirement benefits, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate PPG management, although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates. Currency From December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008, the U.S. dollar strengthened against the currencies of most of the countries in which PPG operates, most notably against the euro, the British pound sterling, the Polish zloty, the Brazilian real, the South Korean won and the Australian dollar. As a result, the effects of translating the net assets of PPGs operations denominated in non U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar decreased consolidated net assets at December 31, 2008 by $499 million compared to December 31, 2007. During much of the year, the U.S. dollar was weaker against the currencies of many countries in which PPG operates than it was in 2007, which had a favorable impact on 2008 pretax earnings of $45 million from the translation of these foreign earnings into U.S. dollars. During 2007, the U.S. dollar weakened against certain of the currencies in the countries in which PPG operates, most notably against the euro, the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real. The effects of translating the net assets of PPGs operations denominated in non U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar increased consolidated net assets at December 31, 2007 by $260 million compared to December 31, 2006. In addition, the weaker U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on 2007 pretax earnings of $47 million. During 2006, the U.S. dollar weakened against the currencies of most of the countries in which PPG operates, most notably against the euro, the British pound sterling and the Australian dollar. The effects of translating the net assets of PPGs operations denominated in non U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar increased consolidated net assets by $179 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. In addition, the weaker U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on 2006 pretax earnings of $9 million. Forward Looking Statements The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. Managements Discussion and Analysis and other sections of this Annual Report contain forward looking statements that reflect the Companys current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward looking statements are identified by the use of the words aim, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate and other expressions that indicate future events and trends. Any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also, note the following cautionary statements. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the Companys forward looking statements. Such factors include increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors, fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials, the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom, economic and political conditions in international markets, the ability to penetrate existing, developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets, which also depends on economic and political conditions, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates, the impact of environmental regulations, unexpected business disruptions and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation, including litigation that could result if the proposed asbestos settlement does not become effective. However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, while the list of factors presented here and under Item 1a is considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward looking statements. Consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forward looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties, other factors set forth in Item 1a of this Form 10 K and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk PPG is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and natural gas prices and to changes in PPGs stock price. The Company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks. A detailed description of these exposures and the Companys risk management policies are provided in Note 11, Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Activities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 26 2008 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis The following disclosures summarize PPGs exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks. Quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible, unfavorable changes in market rates can impact PPGs consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2008 and 2007 were used to hedge PPGs exposure to foreign currency transaction risk. The fair value of these contracts as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 were liabilities of $17 million and assets of $0.4 million, respectively. The potential reduction in PPGs earnings resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for European currencies and 20% for Asian and South American currencies for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 would have been $27 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Concurrent with the March 18, 2008 completion of the $1.55 billion public debt offering, PPG entered into ten U.S. dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of $1.3 billion, of which $600 million were to settle on March 15, 2013 and $700 million were to settle on March 15, 2018. On March 18, 2008, PPG paid the counterparties to the contracts a total of $1.3 billion and received euros, which were used to repay most of the 1 billion bridge loan, which the Company employed to finance the acquisition of SigmaKalon. During the fourth quarter of 2008, PPG converted $1.16 billion of these contracts to $208 million of cash and replaced them with new cross currency swap contracts. On settlement of the contracts, PPG will receive $1.3 billion U.S. dollars and pay euros to the counterparties to the contracts of which $600 million will settle on March 15, 2013 and $700 million will settle on March 15, 2018. The Company has designated these swaps as hedges of its net investment in SigmaKalon and, as a result, mark to fair value adjustments of the swaps have been and will be recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, the aggregate fair value of these swaps was a liability of $130 million. A 10% increase in the value of the euro to the U.S. dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts and increased the liability by $181 million at December 31, 2008. PPG had non U.S. dollar denominated debt outstanding of $1,373 million as of December 31, 2008 and $1,636 million as of December 31, 2007. A weakening of the U.S. dollar by 10% against European currencies and by 20% against Asian and South American currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately $118 million and $203 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of PPGs interest rate risk. The fair value of the interest rate swaps was an asset of $3 million and $6 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The fair value of these swaps would have decreased by $0.5 million and $8 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, if variable interest rates increased by 10%. A 10% increase in interest rates in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in Asia and South America would have affected PPGs variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense approximately $3 million as of December 31, 2008 and $10 million as of December 31, 2007. Further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the Companys fixed rate debt by approximately $118 million and $48 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively; however, such changes would not have had an effect on PPGs annual earnings or cash flows. The fair value of natural gas swap contracts in place as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 was a liability of $85 million and $8 million, respectively. These contracts were entered into to reduce PPGs exposure to higher prices of natural gas. A 10% reduction in the price of natural gas would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these contracts and increased the liability by $27 million and $26 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. An equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the Companys exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute PPG stock into an asbestos settlement trust (see Note 11 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Activities and Note 15, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K). The fair value of this instrument as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 was a liability of $6 million and an asset of $18 million, respectively. A 10% decrease in PPGs stock price would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of this instrument and increased the liability by $6 million at December 31, 2008 and reduced the asset by $6 million at December 31, 2007. 2008 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 27 Table of Contents
