Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Performance in 2009 compared with 2008 Performance Overview Our sales in 2009 totaled $12.2 billion compared to $15.8 billion in 2008. The sales decrease totaled 23%. Sales decreased 13% due to lower sales volumes in all reportable segments reflecting the adverse impact of the global recession on demand, 4% due to weaker foreign currency, 5% due to the absence of sales from the divested automotive glass and services business and 1% due to lower selling prices. Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, decreased by $2,616 million in 2009 to $7,539 million compared to $10,155 million in 2008. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 61.6% in 2009 compared to 64.1% in 2008. Cost of sales in 2008 includes $94 million for the flow through cost of sales of the step up to fair value of acquired inventory. The reduction in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was due to our higher margin coatings businesses being a larger portion of our total 2009 results, favorable manufacturing cost efficiency and favorable price net of inflation. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $496 million in 2009 compared to 2008 due to lower sales volumes, specific overhead cost reduction actions taken in response to the decline in the global economy, the impact of foreign currency translation and the absence of the 2008 charge of $19 million for special termination benefits and a pension curtailment loss relating to the sale of the automotive glass and services business. Depreciation expense decreased by $74 million in 2009 due to the impact of foreign currency translation, our restructuring actions and the divestiture of the automotive glass and services business. Research and development costs decreased by $63 million in 2009 largely due to cost reduction efforts and the impact of foreign currency translation. Interest expense decreased by $61 million in 2009, reflective of the lower debt balances and lower interest rates in 2009. During the first quarter of 2009, the Company finalized a restructuring plan that is focused on further reducing PPGs global cost structure. The Company recorded a charge of $186 million for the cost of this restructuring. During the third quarter of 2008, the Company finalized a restructuring plan that is part of implementing PPGs global transformation strategy and the integration of its acquisition of SigmaKalon. The Company recorded a charge of $163 million for the cost of this restructuring. Other earnings increased by $13 million in 2009 due primarily to the impact of gains on non operating asset sales. The effective tax rate on pretax earnings in 2009 was 31.0% compared to 31.3% in 2008. The 2009 rate includes a tax benefit of $2 million related to audit settlements. The 2009 rate also includes a tax benefit of 24.5% related to the business restructuring charge and a tax benefit of 38.5% related to the adjustment to increase the current value of the Companys obligation relating to asbestos claims under the proposed asbestos settlement, as discussed in Note 16, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The tax rate was approximately 30% on the remaining pretax earnings in 2009. The 2008 rate includes a tax benefit of $14 million related to the settlement with the Internal Revenue Service of our U.S. tax returns for tax years 2004, 2005 and 2006. The 2008 rate also includes a total net tax benefit of 26.5% on costs related to the acquisition of SigmaKalon, the charges for the catch up of depreciation expense and the impact of benefit changes related to the divestiture of the automotive glass and services business, the business restructuring charge, the adjustment to increase the current value of the Companys obligation under the proposed asbestos settlement and the gain on divestiture of the automotive glass and services business. The tax rate was approximately 31% on the remaining pretax earnings in 2008. Net income (attributable to PPG) and earnings per share assuming dilution (attributable to PPG) for 2009 and 2008 are summarized below: (Millions, except per share amounts) Year ended December 31, 2009 Net Income $ EPS Net income (attributable to PPG) $ 336 $ 2.03 Net income (attributable to PPG) includes: Charges related to: Business restructuring 141 0.86 Asbestos settlement net(1) 8 0.05 2009 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 15 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis (Millions, except per share amounts) Year ended December 31, 2008 Net Income $ EPS Net income (attributable to PPG) $ 538 $ 3.25 Net income (attributable to PPG) includes: Charges related to: Business restructuring 110 0.67 Asbestos settlement net(1) 2 0.01 Acquisition related costs(2) 89 0.54 Depreciation catch up (3) 11 0.07 Divestiture related benefit costs(4) 12 0.07 Gain on divestiture of automotive glass and services business (3 ) (0.02 ) (1) Net increase in the current value of the Companys obligation relating to asbestos claims under the proposed asbestos settlement.

Results of Reportable Business Segments Net sales Segment income (loss) (Millions) 2009 2008 2009 2008 Performance Coatings $ 4,095 $ 4,716 $ 551 $ 582 Industrial Coatings 3,068 3,999 159 212 Architectural Coatings EMEA 1,952 2,249 128 141 Optical and Specialty Materials 1,002 1,134 235 244 Commodity Chemicals 1,273 1,837 152 340 Glass 849 1,914 (39 ) 70 Performance Coatings sales decreased $621 million or 13% in 2009. Sales declined 13% as a result of lower sales volumes, particularly in the automotive refinish business and architectural coatings Americas and Asia/Pacific businesses. The volume decline in automotive refinish was most pronounced in the U.S. and Europe, while the decline in architectural coatings was mainly in the U.S. and Latin America. Weaker foreign currency also reduced sales by 3%. Sales increased 3% due to improved pricing. Segment income in 2009 decreased $31 million, including a decline of $24 million due to currency. The earnings impact of lower sales volume was largely offset by favorable pricing and lower overhead, manufacturing and input costs. Industrial Coatings sales decreased $931 million or 23% in 2009. Sales decreased 21% due to lower sales volumes, most notably in the automotive and industrial businesses, reflecting the severe decline in demand resulting from the global recession. Volume declines in the segment occurred in all major regions. Sales also declined 3% due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Sales increased 1% due to increased selling prices. Segment income declined $53 million in 2009. The decline in earnings due to lower volumes was about $320 million. Factors increasing segment income were lower overhead, manufacturing and input costs and improved selling prices. Architectural Coatings EMEA sales decreased $297 million or 13% in 2009. Sales decreased 9% due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation and 7% from lower sales volumes. Sales increased 3% due to increased selling prices. Segment income decreased $13 million in 2009, including $19 million due to currency. The earnings impact of lower sales volumes and inflation were more than offset by lower overhead costs and higher selling prices and other income. Optical and Specialty Materials sales decreased $132 million or 12% in 2009. Sales decreased 10% due to volume, in part reflecting strong 2008 volumes associated with the launch of Transitions Opticals next generation lens product in North America. Volumes were also lower in the silicas business as a result of the slowdown in the automotive OEM market. Sales declined 2% due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Segment income decreased $9 million in 2009. The decrease in segment income was primarily the result of lower sales volumes, which was partially offset by lower manufacturing and overhead costs. Commodity Chemicals sales decreased $564 million or 31% in 2009. Sales declined 21% due to lower selling prices, 9% due to lower sales volumes and 1% due to currency. Segment income decreased $188 million in 2009 due to the negative impact of lower selling prices and volumes. Factors that contributed to offsetting some of the earnings decline were lower input costs, particularly energy, lower overhead costs and higher other income. Glass sales decreased $1,065 million or 56% in 2009. About $725 million of the sales decrease was due to the divestiture of a majority interest in the automotive glass and services business, which was completed in September 2008. The remaining decrease in sales was due mainly to lower sales volumes in the performance glazings and fiber glass businesses, reflecting reduced construction and general industrial demand and, to a lesser extent, weaker foreign currency and lower selling prices. Segment income decreased $109 million in 2009, with $16 million 16 2009 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis due to the absence of earnings from the divested automotive glass and services business. The remaining decline in segment earnings was due to the negative impact of lower sales volumes and lower selling prices. Lower overhead, manufacturing and input costs positively impacted segment income. Outlook In 2009, the global economy was mired in a severe recession which began during 2008. The severity of the recession prompted intervention by many governments to introduce a variety of stimulus measures to stabilize economies and various industries or sectors, including the banking sector due to intense global liquidity concerns. Global industrial end markets experienced rapid declines in the fourth quarter of 2008, and many of these markets remained depressed throughout 2009. In addition, in late 2008 and early 2009, many industries destocked inventory levels which further reduced manufacturing demand. In the latter half of 2009, the majority of this inventory destocking was completed, and some end markets began to experience gradual demand improvements from what were extremely low levels in comparison with recent history. In recognition of the global economic slowdown, prices of energy and many related commodities dramatically declined in late 2008 and early 2009, from what were, in many cases, historically high price levels directly preceding the recession. The North American economy began 2009 at very low activity levels, with some industries, such as automotive OEM, down 40 50 percent versus the prior year level. As a result, the U.S. automotive industry experienced a significant retrenchment early in the year, and two major auto companies emerged from bankruptcy with the help of extensive government financial aid. In the second half of 2009, the automotive market experienced higher and more consistent production and sales levels, although the overall market still remained at a very low activity level. Construction markets continued to weaken as residential construction experienced a third consecutive year of slower demand, and commercial construction, which grew in 2008, declined swiftly in 2009. This overall declining economic environment resulted in a continued upward shift of the U.S. unemployment rate and further declines in consumer confidence levels. Toward the end of the year, some sectors began to experience a gradual recovery in demand but still remained at levels well below those of 2008 or 2007. The European economy in 2009 experienced similar industrial inventory destocking and demand declines. These declines were offset somewhat with strong government stimulus programs targeted at manufacturing, including automotive production. The primary Asian economies in which we participate started 2009 with low GDP growth largely due to fewer exports as a result of the weak global economy. Growth levels accelerated toward the middle of 2009 due largely to a variety of focused government stimulus programs in China aimed at increasing local consumption. As a result of the success of these programs, Chinas GDP grew at just below 9 percent for the year despite lower year over year exports. Also in Asia/Pacific, India experienced solid GDP growth exceeding 6 percent and Australia grew, but at less than 1 percent. For the year in total, the economies of this region well outperformed those of the other major regions of the world. Entering 2010, the overall global economic outlook is cautiously optimistic, with expectations of gradual year over year improvement in many industrial sectors. It is also anticipated that growth will continue in most Asian economies driven by these global demand improvements. Modest recovery is expected to continue in the North American economy, with some offsets due to later economic cycle sectors such as commercial construction, which is projected to continue to decline, and aerospace. The recovery rate in Europe in 2010 is expected to lag that of both Asia and North America. PPG typically experiences fluctuating prices for energy and raw materials used in many of our businesses. Price inflation has resulted from global industrial expansion, supply/demand imbalance and increases in supplier feedstock costs. Price deflation stemmed from lower economic activity and resulting supply/demand imbalances from our suppliers as was the case in 2009 when our coatings raw material costs declined about $150 million following increases of $150 million and $40 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our current forecast for the early portion of 2010 is for moderate raw material inflation stemming from higher global energy prices in comparison to the full year of 2009 and moderate global economic growth. Given the volatile supply/demand, energy cost and currency environment, it is not feasible to project full year raw material pricing, but the main drivers will continue to be overall economic conditions and resulting supply and demand factors. Changes in natural gas pricing have a significant impact on the operating performance of our Commodity Chemicals and Glass businesses. Each one dollar change in our price of natural gas per million British thermal units (mmbtu) has a direct impact of $60 million to $70 million on our annual operating costs. Our 2009 natural gas costs averaged over $6.00 per mmbtu for the year, while our 2008 costs averaged about $9.00 per unit. We currently estimate our cost for natural gas in the first quarter of 2010 will be $7.00 per mmbtu, which is roughly equal to the first quarter of 2009. We currently have about 30% of our first quarter 2009 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 17 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis 2010 U.S. natural gas purchases hedged at a price of about $8.50 per unit, and about 25% of the remainder of 2010 at a price of about $7.75 per unit. The current spot price for natural gas is just below $6.00 per unit. While it remains difficult to predict future natural gas prices, in order to reduce the risks associated with volatile prices, we will continue to use a variety of techniques, which include reducing consumption through improved manufacturing processes, switching to alternative fuels and hedging. Consistent with deflation in energy costs and because of lower end market demand, the selling prices and profitability of our Commodity Chemicals segment dropped severely during 2009 following near all time high levels in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009. U.S. caustic demand weakened because of falling industrial production. At the end of the year, as customer inventory destocking began to diminish, demand and selling prices began to modestly recover. Our ongoing pension and postretirement benefit costs were $327 million in 2009, an increase of about $100 million from 2008. These costs are expected to decline in 2010 by about $50 million. During 2009, PPG contributions to our pension plans totaled about $450 million, and we anticipate 2010 contributions will be about $240 million. The Company announced significant restructuring actions in both the third quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, in recognition of lower demand levels, that focused on reducing our cost structure, including actions associated with achieving the synergies from the integration of the acquired SigmaKalon business. The total annual savings from these actions are expected to be about $250 million upon full implementation, including incremental savings in 2010 of about $100 million. We expect our tax rate in 2010 to be 30%, including a tax benefit of approximately 2% associated with the federal subsidy under Medicare Part D as described in Note 15, Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The tax benefit associated with the Medicare Part D subsidy could be changed by the healthcare reform legislation currently being considered by Congress. The current global economic outlook for 2010 reflects a gradual recovery, but that outlook remains somewhat fragile due in part to the uncertainty of whether consumer spending is expected to rise enough to offset the impact of removal of government stimulus spending. As such, PPG expects to see some recovery in demand in 2010 compared with 2009 and will remain focused on continued effective cost management. The Company also entered 2010 with $1 billion of cash on hand, which is a historically high level for the company, and follows an exemplary year of cash generation in 2009, our second highest year of cash generation on record. This strong cash performance is a direct result of lower 2009 activity levels, a management focus on lowering our working capital and the impact of several years of portfolio changes that diversified our geographic sales mix and broadened our end markets served resulting in lower exposure to any individual end market or region. This ability to generate high levels of cash, our prudent deployment of this cash to continuously strengthen the Company, the expected full year benefit of our recent cost restructuring actions and the expectation of a gradual economic recovery gives us optimism regarding the Companys prospects for 2010. Accounting Standards Adopted in 2009 Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under Item 8 describes the Companys recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Accounting Standards to be Adopted in Future Years Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under Item 8 describes the potential impact on PPG of accounting standards that are not yet effective. Performance in 2008 compared with 2007 Divestiture of Automotive Glass and Services Business During the third quarter of 2007, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its automotive glass and services business to Platinum Equity (Platinum) for approximately $500 million. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of this business were classified as held for sale and the results of operations and cash flows of this business were classified as discontinued operations as of September 30, 2007. In the fourth quarter of 2007, PPG was notified that affiliates of Platinum had filed suit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, alleging that Platinum was not obligated to consummate the agreement. Platinum also terminated the agreement. PPG has sued Platinum and certain of its affiliates for damages, including the $25 million breakup fee stipulated by the terms of the agreement, based on various alleged actions of the Platinum parties. While the transaction with Platinum was terminated, PPG management remained committed to a sale of the automotive glass and services business and continued to classify its assets and liabilities as held for sale and report its results of operations and cash flows as discontinued operations through the first quarter of 2008. 18 2009 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis In July 2008, PPG entered into an agreement with affiliates of Kohlberg & Company, LLC, under which PPG would divest the automotive glass and services business to a new company formed by affiliates of Kohlberg. Under the agreement, PPG would receive a noncontrolling interest in the new company, and, as such, the accounting requirements for classifying the business as assets held for sale and reporting its results of operations and cash flows as discontinued operations had no longer been met. The assets and liabilities of the business were classified as held for use in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007, and the results of operations and cash flows of the business through September 30, 2008 have been classified as continuing operations in the Glass reportable segment in the consolidated statements of income and cash flows under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for the three years ended December 31, 2009. In the second quarter of 2008, as a result of the reclassification of the automotive glass and services business to continuing operations, PPG recorded a one time, non cash charge of $17 million ($11 million aftertax) to reflect a catch up of depreciation expense, which was suspended when the business was classified as a discontinued operation. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2008, PPG recorded a charge of $19 million ($12 million aftertax) for special termination benefits and a pension curtailment loss relating to the impact of benefit changes, including accelerated vesting, negotiated as part of the sale. The transaction with affiliates of Kohlberg was completed on September 30, 2008, with PPG receiving total proceeds of $315 million, including $225 million in cash and two 6 year notes totaling $90 million ($60 million at 8.5% interest and $30 million at 10% interest). Both notes, which may be prepaid at any time without penalty, are senior to the equity of the new company. In addition, PPG has received a noncontrolling interest of approximately 40 percent in the new company, Pittsburgh Glass Works LLC. This transaction resulted in a third quarter 2008 gain of $15 million pretax, net of transaction costs, and is included in Other income in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2008 under Item 8. The aftertax gain on the transaction was $3 million, reflective of tax expense of $12 million. Tax expense on the gain includes the tax cost of repatriating certain transaction proceeds from Canada to the U.S. and the impact of certain permanent book/tax differences which resulted in a larger taxable gain. PPG accounts for its interest in Pittsburgh Glass Works LLC under the equity method of accounting from October 1, 2008 onward. PPG has retained certain liabilities for pension and post employment benefits earned for service up to September 30, 2008. Divestiture of Fine Chemicals Business In the third quarter of 2007, PPG entered into an agreement to sell its fine chemicals business to ZaCh System S.p.A., a subsidiary of Zambon Company S.p.A., for approximately $65 million. The sale of this business was completed in November 2007. The results of operations and cash flows of this business, which had previously been included in the Optical and Specialty Materials reportable segment, have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and cash flows under Item 8 for the year ended December 31, 2007. PPG recorded a pretax loss on sale of the fine chemicals business of $25 million ($19 million aftertax) in 2007. Performance Overview Our sales increased 30% to $15.8 billion in 2008 compared to $12.2 billion in 2007. Sales increased 28% due to the impact of acquisitions, 4% due to increased selling prices and 2% due to the positive effects of foreign currency translation. These sales increases were offset by a 2% decline due to lower sales volumes and by a 2% decline related to the automotive glass and services business divestiture. Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased by $2,327 million in 2008 to $10,155 million compared to $7,828 million in 2007. This increase corresponds with the increase in sales. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 64.1% in both 2008 and 2007. Cost of sales in 2008 includes $94 million for the flow through cost of sales of the step up to fair value of acquired inventory related to the SigmaKalon acquisition. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $1,122 million in 2008 due principally to the impact of the acquisition of SigmaKalon. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 21.7% for 2008 compared to 18.9% for 2007. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was due largely to the addition of SigmaKalon and reflects the distribution nature of these businesses, which requires higher selling, distribution, advertising and regional management costs to serve their broad customer profile. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in the Architectural Coatings EMEA reportable segment are in line with PPGs other architectural coatings businesses. Other factors causing the increase in these expenses were higher levels of cost to support growth in our coatings and optical businesses, higher bad debt expense associated with the impact of the weakening economy on our customers, a second quarter charge of $19 million for special termination benefits and foreign currency translation. 2009 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 19 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis Depreciation expense increased by $83 million due primarily to the acquisition of SigmaKalon. Research and development costs increased by $103 million and amortization increased by $77 million compared to 2007. These increases were primarily due to the acquisition of SigmaKalon. Interest expense increased by $161 million in 2008 due to debt incurred to finance the acquisition of SigmaKalon. During the third quarter of 2008, the Company finalized a restructuring plan that is part of implementing PPGs global transformation strategy and the integration of its acquisition of SigmaKalon. The Company recorded a charge of $163 million for the cost of this restructuring. The effective tax rate on pretax earnings from continuing operations in 2008 was 31.3% compared to 29.1% in 2007. The 2008 rate includes a tax benefit of $14 million related to the settlement with the Internal Revenue Service of our U.S. tax returns for tax years 2004, 2005 and 2006. The 2008 rate also includes a total net tax benefit of 26.5% on costs related to the acquisition of SigmaKalon, the charges for the catch up of depreciation expense and the impact of benefit changes related to the divestiture of the automotive glass and services business, the business restructuring charge, the adjustment to increase the current value of the Companys obligation under the proposed asbestos settlement and the gain on divestiture of the automotive glass and services business. The tax rate was approximately 31% on the remaining pretax earnings in 2008. The rate in 2007 includes the benefit of $15 million for the reversal of a valuation allowance previously recorded against the benefit of a tax net operating loss carryforward, the benefit associated with an enacted reduction in the Canadian federal corporate income tax rate and a tax benefit of 39% on the adjustment to increase the current value of the Companys obligation under the proposed asbestos settlement. The tax rate was 30.5% on the remaining pretax earnings from continuing operations in 2007. The effective tax rate on pretax earnings from discontinued operations in 2007 was 25.2%. The rate in 2007 included a tax benefit of 24% on the loss on the sale of the fine chemicals business. The tax rate was 36.5% on the remaining pretax earnings from discontinued operations in 2007. Net income and earnings per share assuming dilution for 2008 and 2007 are summarized below: (Millions, except per share amounts) Year ended December 31, 2008 Net Income $ EPS Net income $ 538 $ 3.25 Net income includes: Charges related to: Business restructuring 110 0.67 Acquisition related costs(1) 89 0.54 Depreciation catch up(2) 11 0.07 Divestiture related benefit costs(3) 12 0.07 Asbestos settlement net(4) 2 0.01 Gain on divestiture of automotive glass and services business (3) (0.02) (Millions, except per share amounts) Year ended December 31, 2007 Net Income $ EPS Net income $ 834 $ 5.03 Net income includes: Charges related to: Asbestos settlement net(4) 15 0.09 Acquisition related costs(5) 4 0.03 Divestiture related benefit costs(6) 11 0.06 Loss on divestiture of fine chemicals business 19 0.11 (1) Costs related to SigmaKalon acquisition, including $66 million aftertax for the flow through cost of sales of the step up to fair value of acquired inventory and $23 million aftertax for the write off of in process research and development.

Results of Reportable Business Segments Net sales Segment income (Millions) 2008 2007 2008 2007 Performance Coatings $ 4,716 $ 3,811 $ 582 $ 563 Industrial Coatings 3,999 3,646 212 370 Architectural Coatings EMEA 2,249 141 Optical and Specialty Materials 1,134 1,029 244 235 Commodity Chemicals 1,837 1,539 340 243 Glass 1,914 2,195 70 138 20 2009 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis Performance Coatings sales increased $905 million or 24% in 2008. Sales increased 21% due to acquisitions, largely due to the impact of the SigmaKalon protective and marine coatings business. Sales also grew by 3% due to higher selling prices and 2% due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation. Sales volumes declined 2% as reduced volumes in architectural coatings Americas and Asia Pacific and automotive refinish were not fully offset by improved volumes in the aerospace and protective and marine businesses. Volume growth in the aerospace businesses occurred throughout the world, while the volume growth in protective and marine coatings occurred primarily in Asia. Segment income increased $19 million in 2008. Factors increasing segment income were the positive impact of acquisitions, lower overhead costs and the positive impact of foreign currency translation. The benefit of higher selling prices more than offset the negative impact of inflation, including higher raw materials and benefit costs. Segment income was reduced by the impact of the lower sales volumes in architectural coatings and automotive refinish, which more than offset the benefit of volume gains in the aerospace and protective and marine coatings businesses. Industrial Coatings sales increased $353 million or 10% in 2008. Sales increased 11% due to acquisitions, including the impact of the SigmaKalon industrial coatings business. Sales also grew 3% due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation, and 1% from higher selling prices. Sales volumes declined 5% as reduced volumes were experienced in all three businesses, reflecting the substantial declines in global demand. Volume declines in the automotive and industrial businesses were primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Additional volume declines in the European and Asian regions were experienced by the industrial coatings business. In packaging coatings, volume declines in Europe were only partially offset by gains in Asia and North America. Segment income declined $158 million in 2008 due to the lower volumes and inflation, including higher raw material and freight costs, the impact of which was only partially mitigated by the increased selling prices. Segment income also declined due to higher selling and distribution costs, including higher bad debt expense. Factors increasing segment income were the earnings of acquired businesses, the positive impact of foreign currency translation and lower manufacturing costs. Architectural Coatings EMEA sales for the year were $2,249 million. This business was acquired in the SigmaKalon acquisition. Segment income was $141 million, which included amortization expense of $63 million related to acquired intangible assets and depreciation expense of $58 million. Optical and Specialty Materials sales increased $105 million or 10% in 2008. Sales increased 5% due to higher volumes in our optical products business resulting from the launch of Transitions Opticals next generation lens product, 3% due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation and 2% due to increased selling prices. Segment income increased $9 million in 2008. The increase in segment income was the result of increased sales volumes and the favorable impact of currency partially offset by increased selling and marketing costs in the optical products business related to the Transitions Optical product launch mentioned above. Increased selling prices only partially offset higher raw material costs, primarily in our silicas business. Commodity Chemicals sales increased $298 million or 19% in 2008. Sales increased 18% due to higher selling prices and 1% due to improved sales volumes. Segment income increased $97 million in 2008. Segment income increased in large part due to higher selling prices, which more than offset the negative impact of inflation, primarily higher raw material and energy costs. Segment income also improved due to lower manufacturing costs, while lower margin mix and equity earnings reduced segment income. Glass sales decreased $281 million or 13% in 2008. Sales decreased 11% due to the divestiture of the automotive glass and services business in September 2008 and 4% due to lower sales volumes. Sales increased 2% due to higher selling prices. Segment income decreased $68 million in 2008. Segment income decreased due to the divestiture of the automotive glass and services business, lower volumes, the negative impact of inflation and lower equity earnings from our Asian fiber glass joint ventures. Factors increasing segment income were lower manufacturing costs, higher selling prices and stronger foreign currency. See Note 25, Reportable Business Segment Information, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further information related to the Companys operating segments and reportable business segments. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, including Environmental Matters PPG is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against others, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Note 16, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for a description of certain of these lawsuits, including a description of the proposed asbestos settlement and a description of the antitrust suits against PPG related to the flat glass and automotive refinish industries. As discussed in Item 3 and Note 16, although 2009 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 21 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable, management believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving PPG, including asbestos related claims in the event the proposed asbestos settlement described in Note 16 does not become effective, will not have a material effect on PPGs consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. It is PPGs policy to accrue expenses for environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted. Management anticipates that the resolution of the Companys environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, PPG had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling $287 million and $299 million, respectively, of which $59 million and $44 million, respectively, were classified as current liabilities. Pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2009, 2008 and 2007 totaled $11 million, $15 million and $12 million, respectively, and are included in Other charges in the consolidated statement of income. Cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated $24 million, $24 million and $19 million, in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As part of the allocation of the SigmaKalon purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the reserve for environmental contingencies was increased by $37 million in 2008. The impact of foreign currency translation increased the liability by $1 million in 2009 and decreased the liability by $5 million in 2008. In addition to the amounts currently reserved for environmental remediation, the Company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as $200 million to $300 million, which range is unchanged since December 31, 2008. Such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence. Our continuing efforts to analyze and assess the environmental issues associated with a former chromium manufacturing plant site located in Jersey City, N.J., and at the Calcasieu River Estuary located near our Lake Charles, La., chlor alkali plant resulted in a pre tax charge of $173 million in the third quarter of 2006 for the estimated costs of remediating these sites. These charges for estimated environmental remediation costs in 2006 were significantly higher than PPGs historical range. Excluding 2006, pretax charges against income have ranged between $10 million and $49 million per year for the past 15 years. We anticipate that charges against income in 2010 for environmental remediation costs will be within this historical range. Management expects cash outlays for environmental remediation costs to be approximately $70 million in 2010 and to range from $50 million to $70 million annually through 2014. It is possible that technological, regulatory and enforcement developments, the results of environmental studies and other factors could alter our expectations with respect to charges against income and future cash outlays. Specifically, the level of expected cash outlays is highly dependent upon activity related to the former chromium manufacturing plant site in New Jersey, as PPG awaits approval of workplans that have been submitted to the applicable regulatory agencies. Impact of Inflation In 2009, PPG experienced a reduction in our energy and raw material costs, following the significant increases in these costs experienced in 2008 and 2007, which was driven by lower global demand as a result of the recession and the delayed impact of lower oil prices. This impact was largely offset by reductions in our selling prices. The impact of inflation net of price was negative in our Commodity Chemicals and Glass reportable segments and was positive in our three Coatings and the Optical and Specialty Materials reportable segments. In 2008, PPG was able to more than offset the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation, including the impact of higher raw materials and energy costs, with increased selling prices. In our Commodity Chemicals reportable segment, the increase in our costs due to inflation was more than offset by higher selling prices. In our Performance Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials reportable segments, the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation was offset by higher selling prices. However, in our Industrial Coatings and Glass reportable segments, the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation was not offset by higher selling prices. In 2007, the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation, including the impact of higher raw material costs in our Industrial Coatings, Commodity Chemicals and Glass reportable segments, were not offset by higher selling prices. Higher selling prices did offset the negative impact of inflation in our Performance Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials reportable segments. In 2010, we expect the costs in all our businesses to increase due to the negative effects of inflation, including the cost of certain raw materials as a result of increases in global demand. We will continue our efforts to manage our energy efficiency and our material costs through product reformulation and qualification of additional suppliers, particularly those from lower cost regions of the world. We expect those efforts, combined with increases in our selling prices and manufacturing cost 22 2009 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis efficiencies, will offset the negative impact of inflation in 2010. Liquidity and Capital Resources During the past three years, we had sufficient financial resources to meet our operating requirements, to fund our capital spending, share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to our shareholders. Cash from operating activities was $1,345 million, $1,437 million and $1,063 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in cash from operations in 2009 compared to 2008 of $92 million was due in large part to lower earnings, higher pension contributions and higher cash spending on restructuring in 2009 offset by an increase in cash from a reduction in our working capital. We used the 2009 cash from operating activities to fund our capital spending, pay dividends and repay $646 million of debt during the year and still have over $1 billion of cash on hand at December 31, 2009. The change in working capital elements, excluding the impact of currency, included in cash from operating activities was a source of cash of $377 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. Accounts receivable as a percentage of fourth quarter sales, annualized, for 2009 was 21.1%, down from 22% for 2008. Days sales outstanding decreased to 65 days in 2009 from 71 days in 2008. Inventories as a percentage of fourth quarter sales, annualized, for 2009 was 12.4%, down from 13.3% for 2008. Inventory turnover was 4 times in 2009 and 2008. Total capital spending was $265 million, $2,056 million and $597 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Spending related to modernization and productivity improvements, expansion of existing businesses and environmental control projects was $239 million, $383 million and $364 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and is expected to be approximately $350 million during 2010. Capital spending related to business acquisitions amounted to $26 million, $1,673 million and $233 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Dividends paid to shareholders totaled $353 million, $343 million and $335 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. PPG has paid uninterrupted dividends since 1899, and 2009 marked the 38th consecutive year of increased annual dividend payments to shareholders. Over time, our goal is to sustain our dividends at approximately one third of our earnings per share. We did not have a mandatory contribution to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2009; however, due in large part to the negative investment return on pension plan assets in 2008, we made voluntary contributions to these plans in 2009 totaling $360 million. In 2008 and 2007, we made voluntary contributions to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans of $50 million and $100 million, respectively. Contributions were made to our non U.S. defined benefit pension plans of $90 million, $69 million and $49 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, some of which were required by local funding requirements. Of the total 2009 contributions of $450 million, approximately $120 million was made in the form of PPG stock. We expect to make voluntary contributions to our U.S. plans in 2010 of approximately $150 million, and we expect to make mandatory contributions to our non U.S. plans in 2010 of approximately $90 million. In December of 2008, the Company entered into an agreement with a counterparty to repurchase 1.5 million shares of the Companys stock. Under the terms of the agreement, the counterparty purchased the shares in the open market in January of 2009 and held the shares until December of 2009 when the Company paid the agreed upon price of $39.53 per share and took possession of these shares. The total cost of this share repurchase was approximately $59 million. In 2008, the Company purchased 0.1 million shares of PPG common stock at a cost of $7 million, and during 2007, the Company repurchased 3.7 million shares of PPG common stock at a cost of $274 million. On January 2, 2008, PPG completed the acquisition of SigmaKalon, a worldwide coatings producer based in Uithoorn, Netherlands, from global private investment firm Bain Capital (the seller). The acquired business produces architectural, protective and marine and industrial coatings and is a leading coatings supplier in Europe and other key markets across the globe, with an increasing presence in Africa and Asia. The total transaction value was approximately $3.2 billion, consisting of cash paid to the seller of $1,673 million and debt assumed of $1,517 million. In order to provide financing for the SigmaKalon acquisition, in December 2007, PPG and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a three year 650 million revolving credit facility with several banks and financial institutions and Societe Generale, as facility agent for the lenders. In addition, PPG and a subsidiary entered into two bridge loan agreements, one in the amount of 1 billion with multiple lenders and Credit Suisse as administrative agent for those lenders and the other in the amount of $500 million with Credit Suisse as the lender. In December 2007, PPG issued $617 million of commercial paper and borrowed $1,056 million (717 million) under the 1 billion bridge loan agreement. The proceeds from these borrowings were deposited into escrow in December 2007. Upon closing of the acquisition on January 2, 2008, these amounts were released from escrow and paid to the seller. Also, in January 2008, PPG borrowed $1,143 million, representing the remaining $417 million (283 million) available under the 1 billion bridge loan agreement and $726 million (493 million) under the 650 million revolving 2009 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 23 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis credit facility. The proceeds from these borrowings and cash on hand of $116 million were used to refinance $1,259 million of the $1,517 million of SigmaKalon debt outstanding on the date of acquisition. No amounts were borrowed under the $500 million bridge loan agreement and, due to the passage of time and the specific purpose of this agreement, PPG can no longer make borrowings under this agreement. On March 18, 2008, PPG completed a public offering of $600 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.75% Notes due 2013 (the 2013 Notes), $700 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.65% Notes due 2018 (the 2018 Notes) and $250 million in aggregate principal amount of its 7.70% Notes due 2038 (the 2038 Notes and, together with the 2013 Notes and the 2018 Notes, the Notes). The Notes were offered by the Company pursuant to its existing shelf registration statement. The proceeds of this offering of $1,538 million (net of discount and issuance costs) and additional borrowings of $195 million under the 650 million revolving credit facility were used to repay existing debt, including certain short term debt and the amounts outstanding under the 1 billion bridge loan. No further amounts can be borrowed under the 1 billion bridge loan. The discount and issuance costs related to the Notes, which totaled $12 million, will be amortized to interest expense over the respective lives of the Notes. In July 2008, the Company entered into an agreement to divest its automotive OEM glass and automotive replacement glass and services businesses (automotive glass and services business). Under the agreement, PPG received a noncontrolling ownership interest in the new company formed by the buyer. The transaction was completed on September 30, 2008. The Company received cash proceeds of $225 million at closing and two six year notes totaling $90 million from this transaction. In the fourth quarter 2008, the Company monetized certain cross currency foreign exchange swap contracts, which had been designated as hedges of our Euro denominated net investment in SigmaKalon, and replaced them with new swap contracts. As a result of these swap monetizations, the Company received $208 million in cash proceeds. See Item 7A of this Form 10 K for further information regarding these instruments. In June 2009, PPG entered into a $400 million three year unsecured term loan. We used $116 million of the proceeds from this term loan to retire our 7.05% Notes due 2009; the remainder of the loan proceeds of approximately $284 million were used to retire outstanding amounts under our 650 million revolving credit facility. The principal amount of this term loan is due in three years, and the interest rate is variable based on a spread over LIBOR. The ratio of total debt, including capital leases, to total debt and equity was 47% at December 31, 2009 and 54% at December 31, 2008. The decrease at year end 2009 is primarily due to the reduction of the Companys debt during 2009. We continue to believe that our cash on hand, cash from operations and the Companys available debt capacity will continue to be sufficient to fund operating activities, capital spending, including acquisitions, dividend payments, debt service, amounts due under the proposed asbestos settlement, share repurchases, contributions to pension plans, and PPGs significant contractual obligations. These significant contractual obligations, along with amounts due under the proposed asbestos settlement are presented in the following table. Obligations Due In: (Millions) Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Contractual Obligations Long term debt $ 3,046 $ 2 $ 484 $ 604 $ 1,956 Short term debt 268 268 Capital lease obligations 32 2 3 3 24 Operating leases 646 129 185 118 214 Interest payments(1) 1,619 177 338 265 839 Pension contributions(2) 240 240 Unconditional purchase obligations 971 314 303 94 260 Total $ 6,822 $ 1,132 $ 1,313 $ 1,084 $ 3,293 Asbestos Settlement(3) Aggregate cash payments $ 825 $ 437 $ 24 $ 23 $ 341 PPG stock and other 97 97 Total $ 922 $ 534 $ 24 $ 23 $ 341 (1) Includes interest on all outstanding debt. Interest for variable rate debt instruments is based on effective rates at December 31, 2009. Interest for fixed rate debt instruments have been adjusted for the impact of interest rate swaps using the effective rate at December 31, 2009. (2) Includes the estimated pension contribution for 2010 only, as PPG is unable to estimate the pension contributions beyond 2010. (3) We have recorded an obligation equal to the net present value of the aggregate cash payments, along with the PPG stock and other assets to be contributed to a trust under the proposed asbestos settlement. However, PPG has no obligation to pay any amounts under this settlement until the Funding Effective Date, as more fully discussed in Note 16, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The unconditional purchase commitments are principally take or pay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials, including industrial gases, natural gas, coal and electricity, consistent with customary industry practice. These amounts also include PPGs commitment to purchase electricity and steam from the RS Cogen joint venture discussed in Note 6, Investments, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 24 2009 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis See Note 9, Debt and Bank Credit Agreements and Leases, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit, letters of credit, guarantees and debt covenants. In addition to the amounts available under the lines of credit, the Company has an automatic shelf registration on file with the SEC pursuant to which it may issue, offer and sell from time to time on a continuous or delayed basis any combination of securities in one or more offerings. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Companys off balance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations disclosed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in Note 9, Debt and Bank Credit Agreements and Leases, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Estimates Management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under Item 8 of this Form 10 K and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate. We believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies, under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated, and to accounting for pensions, other postretirement benefits, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies. Contingencies, by their nature, relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss. The most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable, to environmental remediation, to pending, impending or overtly threatened litigation against the Company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years. For more information on these matters, see Note 4, Working Capital Detail, Note 14, Income Taxes and Note 16, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works. To accomplish this, extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, turnover, medical costs and discount rates. These assumptions are reviewed annually. See Note 15, Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, under Item 8 for information on these plans and the assumptions used. The discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined by reference to a current yield curve and by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments. The discount rate assumption for 2010 is 5.90% for our U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. A change in the discount rate of 75 basis points, with all other assumptions held constant, would impact 2010 net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately $12 million and $9 million, respectively. The expected return on plan assets assumption used in accounting for our pension plans is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future long term investment returns. For 2009, the return on plan assets assumption for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans was 8.5%. We will use the same assumption for 2010. A change in the rate of return of 75 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would impact 2010 net periodic pension expense by approximately $18 million. As discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K, the Company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying values. Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows. Based on this testing, none of our goodwill or identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives was impaired as of December 31, 2009. As part of our ongoing financial reporting process, a collaborative effort is undertaken involving PPG managers with functional responsibility for financial, credit, environmental, legal, tax and benefit matters. The results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments on these contingencies and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements. We believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K related to these contingencies, pensions, other postretirement benefits, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate PPG management, although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates. 2009 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 25 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis Currency From December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009, the U.S. dollar weakened against the currencies of most of the countries in which PPG operates, most notably against the euro, the Canadian dollar, the British pound sterling, the Polish zloty, the Brazilian real, the South Korean won and the Australian dollar. As a result, the effects of translating the net assets of PPGs operations denominated in non U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar increased consolidated net assets at December 31, 2009 by $173 million compared to December 31, 2008. During much of the year, the U.S. dollar was stronger against the currencies of many countries in which PPG operates than it was in 2008, which had an unfavorable impact on 2009 pretax earnings of $29 million from the translation of these foreign earnings into U.S. dollars. From December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008, the U.S. dollar strengthened against the currencies of most of the countries in which PPG operates, most notably against the euro, the British pound sterling, the Polish zloty, the Brazilian real, the South Korean won and the Australian dollar. As a result, the effects of translating the net assets of PPGs operations denominated in non U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar decreased consolidated net assets at December 31, 2008 by $499 million compared to December 31, 2007. During much of the year, the U.S. dollar was weaker against the currencies of many countries in which PPG operates than it was in 2007, which had a favorable impact on 2008 pretax earnings of $45 million from the translation of these foreign earnings into U.S. dollars. During 2007, the U.S. dollar weakened against certain of the currencies in the countries in which PPG operates, most notably against the euro, the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real. The effects of translating the net assets of PPGs operations denominated in non U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar increased consolidated net assets at December 31, 2007 by $260 million compared to December 31, 2006. In addition, the weaker U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on 2007 pretax earnings of $47 million. Forward Looking Statements The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. Managements Discussion and Analysis and other sections of this Annual Report contain forward looking statements that reflect the Companys current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward looking statements are identified by the use of the words aim, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate and other expressions that indicate future events and trends. Any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also, note the following cautionary statements. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the Companys forward looking statements. Such factors include global economic conditions, increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors, fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials, the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, the realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring initiatives, difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom, economic and political conditions in international markets, the ability to penetrate existing, developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets, which also depends on economic and political conditions, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates, the impact of environmental regulations, unexpected business disruptions and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation, including litigation that could result if the proposed asbestos settlement does not become effective. However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, while the list of factors presented here and under Item 1A is considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward looking statements. Consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forward looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties, other factors set forth in Item 1A of this Form 10 K and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk PPG is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and natural gas prices and to changes in PPGs stock price. The Company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks. A detailed description of these exposures and the 26 2009 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis Companys risk management policies are provided in Note 12, Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Activities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The following disclosures summarize PPGs exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks. Quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible, unfavorable changes in market rates can impact PPGs consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2009 and 2008 were used to hedge PPGs exposure to foreign currency transaction risk. The fair value of these contracts as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 were liabilities of $3 million and $17 million, respectively. The potential reduction in PPGs earnings resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for European currencies and 20% for Asian and South American currencies for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 would have been $17 million and $27 million, respectively. Concurrent with the March 18, 2008 completion of the $1.55 billion public debt offering, PPG entered into ten U.S. dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of $1.3 billion, of which $600 million were to settle on March 15, 2013 and $700 million were to settle on March 15, 2018. On March 18, 2008, PPG paid the counterparties to the contracts a total of $1.3 billion and received euros, which were used to repay most of the 1 billion bridge loan, which the Company employed to finance the acquisition of SigmaKalon. During the fourth quarter of 2008, PPG converted $1.16 billion of these contracts to $208 million of cash and replaced them with new cross currency swap contracts. On settlement of the contracts, PPG will receive $1.3 billion and pay euros to the counterparties to the contracts. The Company has designated these swaps as hedges of its net investment in the acquired SigmaKalon businesses and, as a result, mark to fair value adjustments of the swaps have been and will be recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the aggregate fair value of these swaps was a liability of $308 million and $130 million, respectively. A 10% increase in the value of the euro to the U.S. dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts and increase the liability by $182 million and $181 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. PPG had non U.S. dollar denominated debt outstanding of $723 million as of December 31, 2009 and $1,373 million as of December 31, 2008. A weakening of the U.S. dollar by 10% against European currencies and by 20% against Asian and South American currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately $81 million and $118 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of PPGs interest rate risk. The fair value of the interest rate swaps was an asset of $10 million and $3 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The fair value of these swaps would have changed unfavorably by $3 million and $0.5 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, if variable interest rates increased by 10%. A 10% increase in interest rates in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in Asia and South America would have affected PPGs variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense approximately $1 million as of December 31, 2009 and $3 million as of December 31, 2008. Further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the Companys fixed rate debt by approximately $91 million and $118 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively; however, such changes would not have had an effect on PPGs annual earnings or cash flows. The Company entered into forward starting swaps in the third quarter of 2009 to effectively lock in a fixed interest rate based on the 10 year swap rate, to which will be added a corporate spread, related to future debt refinancings. The notional amount of these swaps totaled $250 million. As of December 31, 2009, the fair value of these swaps was an asset of $3 million. A 10% decline in interest rates would unfavorably affect the fair value of these swaps by $10 million. The fair value of natural gas swap contracts in place as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 was a liability of $50 million and $85 million, respectively. These contracts were entered into to reduce PPGs exposure to higher prices of natural gas. A 10% reduction in the price of natural gas would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these contracts and increased the liability by $14 million and $27 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
