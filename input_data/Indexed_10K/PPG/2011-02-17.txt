Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Performance in 2010 compared with 2009 Performance Overview Our sales in 2010 totaled $13.4 billion compared to $12.2 billion in 2009. The sales increase totaled 10%. Sales increased 8% due to higher sales volumes in all reportable segments, except Architectural Coatings EMEA, reflecting the partial recovery from the impact of the global recession on demand, 1% due to higher selling prices and the remainder due to foreign currency and acquisitions. Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased by $675 million in 2010 to $8,214 million compared to $7,539 million in 2009. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 61.2% in 2010 compared to 61.6% in 2009. The negative impact of inflation on cost of sales in 2010 was offset by increases in selling prices and lower manufacturing costs. The incremental sales volume in 2010 delivered an above average gross margin. These factors combined to produce the reduction in cost of sales as a percentage of sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $43 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to higher sales volumes, inflation and currency, offset partially by specific overhead cost reduction actions. Selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales were 22.2% in 2010, down from 24.0% in 2009. During the first quarter of 2009, the Company finalized a restructuring plan that was focused on further reducing PPGs global cost structure. The Company recorded a charge of $186 million for the cost of these restructuring actions. Other charges increased by $19 million due principally to higher environmental remediation expense compared with the prior year. Other earnings increased by $36 million in 2010 due primarily to higher equity earnings and royalties, offset partially by the absence of gains on non operating asset sales that occured in 2009. The effective tax rate on pretax earnings in 2010 was 32.0% compared to 31.0% in 2009. The 2010 rate includes expense of $85 million resulting from the reduction of our previously provided deferred tax asset related to our liability for retiree medical costs. The deferred tax asset needed to be reduced because the healthcare legislation enacted in March 2010 included a provision that reduces the amount of retiree medical costs that will be deductible after December 31, 2012. The 2010 rate also includes a $5 million benefit as a result of enacted changes in statutory tax rates outside the U.S. and a tax benefit of 38% on the adjustment to increase the current value of the Companys obligation relating to asbestos claims under the proposed settlement, as discussed in Note 16, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The rate was approximately 26% on the remaining pretax earnings in 2010. The 2009 rate includes a tax benefit of $2 million related to audit settlements and a tax benefit of 24.5% related to the business restructuring charge. The rate for 2009 also includes a tax benefit of 38% on the adjustment to increase the current value of the Companys obligation relating to asbestos claims. The rate was approximately 30% on the remaining pretax earnings in 2009. The decrease in the tax rate on the remaining pretax earnings in 2010 is mainly the result of shifts in the geographic mix of pretax earnings to lower taxed regions of the world. Net income (attributable to PPG) and earnings per share assuming dilution (attributable to PPG) for 2010 and 2009 are summarized below: (Millions, except per share amounts) Year ended December 31, 2010 Net Income $ EPS Net income (attributable to PPG) $ 769 $ 4.63 Net income (attributable to PPG) includes: Charges related to: Change in U.

Results of Reportable Business Segments Net sales Segment income (loss) (Millions) 2010 2009 2010 2009 Performance Coatings $ 4,281 $ 4,095 $ 661 $ 551 Industrial Coatings 3,708 3,068 378 159 Architectural Coatings EMEA 1,874 1,952 113 128 Optical and Specialty Materials 1,141 1,002 307 235 Commodity Chemicals 1,434 1,273 189 152 Glass 985 849 74 (39 ) Performance Coatings sales increased $186 million or 5% in 2010. Sales improved 3% due to improved pricing and 2% due to the effects of currency, along with slight volume increases. Volume increases in the refinish, aerospace and protective and marine coatings businesses were offset by a mid single digit percentage volume decline in the architectural Americas and Asia Pacific coatings business. Segment income in 2010 increased $110 million lead by the automotive refinish, protective 16 2010 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents and marine coatings and aerospace businesses. The negative earnings impact of inflation was offset by favorable pricing and lower manufacturing costs. Lower overhead costs and the improved margin mix from volume growth in the refinish, aerospace and protective and marine coatings businesses drove the increased segment earnings. Industrial Coatings sales increased $640 million or 21% in 2010. Sales increased 19% due to higher sales volumes, most notably in the automotive OEM business and the industrial businesss emerging regions, reflecting the gradual recovery from the global recession. Sales also increased due to favorable pricing and the impact of foreign currency translation. Segment income improved $219 million in 2010, including about $260 million due to increased volumes, partially offset by the negative impact of inflation net of increases in selling prices and lower manufacturing and overhead costs. Architectural Coatings EMEA sales decreased $78 million or 4% in 2010. Sales decreased 4% due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation. A mid single digit percentage decline in sales volume was offset by increases in selling prices and the impact of acquisitions. Segment income decreased $15 million in 2010. The earnings impact of lower sales volumes and mix combined with inflation were not fully offset by lower overhead costs and higher selling prices. Optical and Specialty Materials sales increased $139 million or 14% in 2010 due primarily to increased volumes in both the optical and silicas businesses. Segment income increased $72 million in 2010. The increase in segment income was primarily the result of higher sales volumes, which was partially offset by higher selling and advertising costs to support the increased optical volumes. Commodity Chemicals sales increased $161 million or 13% in 2010. Sales improved 15% due to higher volumes, partially offset by a 3% decline in pricing for the year. The impact of foreign currency translation was slightly positive. Segment income increased $37 million in 2010 due to higher volumes as well as favorable manufacturing and overhead costs. Factors that contributed to offsetting some of the earnings improvement were lower pricing and cost inflation. Glass sales increased $136 million or 16% in 2010. The increase in sales was due to higher sales volumes in the fiber glass business partially offset by lower flat glass pricing. Segment income increased $113 million in 2010 due to the higher fiber glass sales volumes, lower manufacturing costs and higher equity earnings, partially offset by lower flat glass pricing. Outlook In 2010, the global economy continued to mend from the severe recession that began during 2008 and continued through most of 2009. The pace of recovery was uneven, with emerging economies rapidly returning to prior activity levels, while volume recovery in many developed economies has been gradual and has not yet returned to 2008 levels. There was also a contrast in the pace of recovery by end market. Global industrial end markets, which were some of the most significantly impacted end markets during the recession, demonstrated a more rapid and consistent recovery throughout the year in nearly all regions. Activity levels in construction markets in the developed regions remained challenging, but rose in many emerging regions. Despite the recovery, activity levels in most developed regions still remain well below pre recession levels, while emerging regions are at or above pre recession levels. After falling in 2009 due to the recession, global prices of energy and many related commodities rose in 2010 in recognition of the stronger demand from the gradual economic recovery while supplies of many materials were tight. The North American economy generally followed the global trends with improving industrial activity, including nearly 40 percent growth in automotive OEM production, versus a recession impacted 2009. Automotive production and sales levels were very consistent throughout the year. Construction markets in North America showed initial signs of a potential recovery early in the year, but demand faded, and annual activity levels were negative once again in both the residential and commercial construction segments. Recovery was evident in other end markets, such as aerospace, transportation and consumer products. Despite the improved economic pace, several factors limited further recovery, including the U.S. unemployment rate, which remained at a high historical level, and a focus on limiting governmental spending and debt loads, including the removal of economic stimulus actions instituted during the recession. The rate of recovery in the European economy in 2010 underperformed in comparison with most other major economies, led by recurring concerns over governmental spending and the ability to sustain or refinance government debt loads. Several major European countries initiated significant austerity measures to reign in spending and maintain access to the debt markets. Eastern European activity levels were mixed, with several countries returning to a growth bias, while others remained mired in the recession. Unemployment levels in most countries in the region remained high, and the effects of the austerity measures were not fully reflected given that most of them were only beginning to be implemented in the latter stages of 2010. One area where improvement was realized was in higher industrial exports from the region. Many of the major emerging economies in which we participate, such as Asia and Latin America, maintained late 2009 economic momentum and grew throughout 2010, in many cases surpassing pre recession economic activity levels. Industrial growth rates remained high, including mid teen percentage growth in China, as 2010 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 17 Table of Contents exports were coupled with higher local consumption. Other regions, such as Latin America and India, also delivered rapid growth throughout the year. These strong growth rates have resulted in some governmental actions to remove previous economic stimulus programs or to dampen the rate of rapid growth. Some initiatives were also a reflection of concerns over inflation driven by the rapid growth. Entering 2011, the expectation is for economic recovery to strengthen and broaden in most end markets and most regions. The growth rate in emerging regions is expected to moderate somewhat, but still easily outpace the developed regions. It is anticipated that the North American recovery will continue with higher industrial activity and construction markets no longer acting as a headwind. The recovery rate in Europe in 2011 is expected to once again lag that of Asia, Latin America and North America, as export growth moderates and further impacts are realized from the 2010 austerity measures. In the middle of 2010, commodity and oil prices began to inflate, and it is anticipated that these prices will remain at elevated levels during 2011. PPG typically experiences fluctuating prices for energy and raw materials used in many of our businesses. Factors which impact our input prices are supply/demand imbalances, global industrial activity levels and changes in supplier feedstock costs. Lower activity levels in 2009 resulted in a decline of $150 million in our coatings raw material costs, and the economic recovery in 2010 resulted in an approximate $210 million increase in these costs, primarily in the second half of the year. We also had inflation in 2008 and 2007 of $150 million and $40 million, respectively. Our current forecast for the early portion of 2011 is for persistent raw material inflation to continue. Given the volatile supply/demand, energy cost and currency environment, it is not feasible to project full year raw material pricing. Changes in natural gas pricing have a significant impact on the financial performance of our Commodity Chemicals and Glass businesses. Each one dollar change in our unit price of natural gas per million British thermal units (mmbtu) has a direct impact of $60 million to $70 million on our annual operating costs. Our 2010 natural gas costs averaged nearly $5.50 per mmbtu for the year, while our 2009 costs averaged about $6.15 per unit. We currently estimate our cost for natural gas in the first quarter of 2011 will be between $5.00 and $5.25 per mmbtu. We currently have about 12% of full year 2011 U.S. natural gas needs hedged at a price of about $7.50 per unit from hedges placed prior to 2010, including about 18% of our first quarter needs at a price of about $8.00 per unit. We have additional hedges for the first quarter, equating to an additional 10 percent of needs and additional hedges for the hurricane months of August through October representing roughly 12% of our needs, which were contracted more recently at closer to current spot pricing, which is about $4.50 per unit. While it remains difficult to predict future natural gas prices, in order to reduce the risks associated with volatile prices, we will continue to use a variety of techniques, which include reducing consumption through improved manufacturing processes, switching to alternative fuels and hedging. In an effort to offset the impacts of energy and raw materials cost inflation on earnings, during 2010, PPG initiated higher selling prices in all operating segments. The Company has historically raised selling prices to counteract the negative earnings impact from this inflation. The higher pricing did not fully counter inflation in our coatings segments in the second half of 2010, which resulted in margin compression in these segments. However, reflecting strong demand, Commodity Chemicals pricing improved throughout the year and served as an offset to the higher overall inflation for PPG late in the year. Additional pricing efforts are underway for 2011 in all of our reporting segments to address the inflation we experienced in the second half of 2010. We intend to supplement these sales gains with continued cost actions as necessary to fully offset the earnings impact of raw material cost inflation. Our pension and postretirement benefit costs were $258 million in 2010, a decrease of about $69 million from 2009. These costs are expected to decline in 2011 by about $20 million to $30 million, including the benefit of our January 2011 plan design change. During 2010 and 2009, PPGs contributions to our pension plans totaled about $340 million and $450 million, respectively, and we anticipate 2011 contributions will be in the range of $100 million to $125 million. The Company announced significant restructuring actions in both the third quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, in recognition of recession driven lower demand levels, that focused on reducing our cost structure, including actions associated with achieving the synergies from the integration of the acquired SigmaKalon business. The total annual savings from these fully completed actions is about $250 million, including incremental realized savings in 2010 of about $100 million. These actions are complete, and all of the savings were realized by the end of 2010. We expect our ongoing tax rate in 2011 to be in the range of 26% to 27%, consistent with the 2010 rate. The reduction we have achieved in 2010 in our ongoing tax rate reflects our sales and earnings growth outside the U.S. where corporate income tax rates are lower, particularly in Asia/Pacific and Europe. The current global economic outlook for 2011 reflects a broadening of the current recovery. As such, PPG expects to see higher demand in 2011 compared with 2010 but intends to remain focused on continued cost management. The Company also entered 2011 with about $2 billion in cash and short term investments, which is a historically high level 18 2010 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents for the Company and includes proceeds from a $1 billion debt offering in November of 2010. Despite the recession, the Companys cash generation has been consistent and at or near record levels the past three years. A stronger operating focus has resulted in lower operating working capital over that same time period. The strengthening economic recovery, our broad geographic footprint, the reductions we have made in our cost structure and our substantial financial flexibility give us optimism regarding the Companys prospects for 2011. Accounting Standards Adopted in 2010 Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under Item 8 describes the Companys recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Accounting Standards to be Adopted in Future Years There are no new accounting standards that have been promulgated prior to December 31, 2010 but not effective until a future date. Performance in 2009 compared with 2008 Performance Overview Our sales in 2009 totaled $12.2 billion compared to $15.8 billion in 2008. The sales decrease totaled 23%. Sales decreased 13% due to lower sales volumes in all reportable segments reflecting the adverse impact of the global recession on demand, 4% due to weaker foreign currency, 5% due to the absence of sales from the divested automotive glass and services business and 1% due to lower selling prices. Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, decreased by $2,616 million in 2009 to $7,539 million compared to $10,155 million in 2008. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 61.6% in 2009 compared to 64.1% in 2008. Cost of sales in 2008 includes $94 million for the flow through cost of sales of the step up to fair value of acquired inventory. The reduction in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was due to our higher margin coatings businesses being a larger portion of our total 2009 results, favorable manufacturing cost efficiency and favorable price net of inflation. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $496 million in 2009 compared to 2008 due to lower sales volumes, specific overhead cost reduction actions taken in response to the decline in the global economy, the impact of foreign currency translation and the absence of the 2008 charge of $19 million for special termination benefits and a pension curtailment loss relating to the sale of the automotive glass and services business. Depreciation expense decreased by $74 million in 2009 due to the impact of foreign currency translation, our restructuring actions and the divestiture of the automotive glass and services business. Research and development costs decreased by $63 million in 2009 largely due to cost reduction efforts and the impact of foreign currency translation. Interest expense decreased by $61 million in 2009, reflective of the lower debt balances and lower interest rates in 2009. During the first quarter of 2009, the Company finalized a restructuring plan that is focused on further reducing PPGs global cost structure. The Company recorded a charge of $186 million for the cost of this restructuring. During the third quarter of 2008, the Company finalized a restructuring plan that is part of implementing PPGs global transformation strategy and the integration of its acquisition of SigmaKalon. The Company recorded a charge of $163 million for the cost of this restructuring. Other earnings increased by $13 million in 2009 due primarily to the impact of gains on non operating asset sales. The effective tax rate on pretax earnings in 2009 was 31.0% compared to 31.3% in 2008. The 2009 rate includes a tax benefit of $2 million related to audit settlements. The 2009 rate also includes a tax benefit of 24.5% related to the business restructuring charge and a tax benefit of 38% related to the adjustment to increase the current value of the Companys obligation relating to asbestos claims under the proposed asbestos settlement, as discussed in Note 16, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The tax rate was approximately 30% on the remaining pretax earnings in 2009. The 2008 rate includes a tax benefit of $14 million related to the settlement with the Internal Revenue Service of our U.S. tax returns for tax years 2004, 2005 and 2006. The 2008 rate also includes a total net tax benefit of 26.5% on costs related to the acquisition of SigmaKalon, the charges for the catch up of depreciation expense and the impact of benefit changes related to the divestiture of the automotive glass and services business, the business restructuring charge, the adjustment to increase the current value of the Companys obligation under the proposed asbestos settlement and the gain on divestiture of the automotive glass and services business. The tax rate was approximately 31% on the remaining pretax earnings in 2008. 2010 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 19 Table of Contents Net income (attributable to PPG) and earnings per share assuming dilution (attributable to PPG) for 2009 and 2008 are summarized below: (Millions, except per share amounts) Year ended December 31, 2009 Net Income $ EPS Net income (attributable to PPG) $ 336 $ 2.03 Net income (attributable to PPG) includes: Charges related to: Business restructuring 141 0.86 Asbestos settlement net(1) 8 0.05 (Millions, except per share amounts) Year ended December 31, 2008 Net Income $ EPS Net income (attributable to PPG) $ 538 $ 3.25 Net income (attributable to PPG) includes: Charges related to: Business restructuring 110 0.67 Asbestos settlement net(1) 2 0.01 Acquisition related costs(2) 89 0.54 Depreciation catch up(3) 11 0.07 Divestiture related benefit costs(4) 12 0.07 Gain on divestiture of automotive glass and services business (3 ) (0.02 ) (1) Net increase in the current value of the Companys obligation relating to asbestos claims under the proposed asbestos settlement.

Results of Reportable Business Segments Net sales Segment income (loss) (Millions) 2009 2008 2009 2008 Performance Coatings $ 4,095 $ 4,716 $ 551 $ 582 Industrial Coatings 3,068 3,999 159 212 Architectural Coatings EMEA 1,952 2,249 128 141 Optical and Specialty Materials 1,002 1,134 235 244 Commodity Chemicals 1,273 1,837 152 340 Glass 849 1,914 (39 ) 70 Performance Coatings sales decreased $621 million or 13% in 2009. Sales declined 13% as a result of lower sales volumes, particularly in the automotive refinish business and architectural coatings Americas and Asia/Pacific businesses. The volume decline in automotive refinish was most pronounced in the U.S. and Europe, while the decline in architectural coatings was mainly in the U.S. and Latin America. Weaker foreign currency also reduced sales by 3%. Sales increased 3% due to improved pricing. Segment income in 2009 decreased $31 million, including a decline of $24 million due to currency. The earnings impact of lower sales volume was largely offset by favorable pricing and lower overhead, manufacturing and input costs. Industrial Coatings sales decreased $931 million or 23% in 2009. Sales decreased 21% due to lower sales volumes, most notably in the automotive OEM and industrial businesses, reflecting the severe decline in demand resulting from the global recession. Volume declines in the segment occurred in all major regions. Sales also declined 3% due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Sales increased 1% due to increased selling prices. Segment income declined $53 million in 2009. The decline in earnings due to lower volumes was about $320 million. Factors increasing segment income were lower overhead, manufacturing and input costs and improved selling prices. Architectural Coatings EMEA sales decreased $297 million or 13% in 2009. Sales decreased 9% due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation and 7% from lower sales volumes. Sales increased 3% due to increased selling prices. Segment income decreased $13 million in 2009, including $19 million due to currency. The earnings impact of lower sales volumes and inflation were more than offset by lower overhead costs and higher selling prices and other income. Optical and Specialty Materials sales decreased $132 million or 12% in 2009. Sales decreased 10% due to volume, in part reflecting strong 2008 volumes associated with the launch of Transitions Opticals next generation lens product in North America. Volumes were also lower in the silicas business as a result of the slowdown in the automotive OEM market. Sales declined 2% due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Segment income decreased $9 million in 2009. The decrease in segment income was primarily the result of lower sales volumes, which was partially offset by lower manufacturing and overhead costs. Commodity Chemicals sales decreased $564 million or 31% in 2009. Sales declined 21% due to lower selling prices, 9% due to lower sales volumes and 1% due to currency. Segment income decreased $188 million in 2009 due to the negative impact of lower selling prices and volumes. Factors that contributed to offsetting some of the earnings decline were lower input costs, particularly energy, lower overhead costs and higher other income. Glass sales decreased $1,065 million or 56% in 2009. About $725 million of the sales decrease was due to the divestiture of a majority interest in the automotive glass and services business, which was completed in September 2008. The remaining decrease in sales was due mainly to lower sales volumes in the flat glass and fiber glass businesses, reflecting reduced construction and general industrial demand and, to a lesser extent, weaker foreign currency and lower selling prices. Segment income decreased $109 million 20 2010 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents in 2009, with $16 million due to the absence of earnings from the divested automotive glass and services business. The remaining decline in segment earnings was due to the negative impact of lower sales volumes and lower selling prices. Lower overhead, manufacturing and input costs positively impacted segment income. See Note 25, Reportable Business Segment Information, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further information related to the Companys operating segments and reportable business segments. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, including Environmental Matters PPG is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against others, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Note 16, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for a description of certain of these lawsuits, including a description of the proposed asbestos settlement and a description of the antitrust suits against PPG related to the flat glass industry. As discussed in Item 3 and Note 16, although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable, management believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving PPG, including asbestos related claims in the event the proposed asbestos settlement described in Note 16 does not become effective, will not have a material effect on PPGs consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. It is PPGs policy to accrue expenses for environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted. In managements opinion, the Company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the Companys environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on PPGs financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. Management anticipates that the resolution of the Companys environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, PPG had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling $272 million and $287 million, respectively, of which $83 million and $59 million, respectively, were classified as current liabilities. Pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2010, 2009 and 2008 totaled $21 million, $11 million and $15 million, respectively, and are included in Other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of income. Cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated $34 million, $24 million and $24 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The impact of foreign currency decreased the liability by $2 million in 2010 and increased the liability by $1 million in 2009. In addition to the amounts currently reserved for environmental remediation, the Company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as $200 million to $400 million, which is a change from the previously reported range of $200 million to $300 million. This change in estimate relates principally to the cost of New Jersey Chrome and legacy glass manufacturing site remediation. Such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence. Our continuing efforts to analyze and assess the environmental issues associated with a former chromium manufacturing plant site located in Jersey City, N.J., and at the Calcasieu River Estuary located near our Lake Charles, La., chlor alkali plant resulted in a pre tax charge of $173 million in the third quarter of 2006 for the estimated costs of remediating these sites. These charges for estimated environmental remediation costs in 2006 were significantly higher than PPGs historical range. Excluding 2006, pretax charges against income have ranged between $10 million and $35 million per year for the past 15 years. We anticipate that charges against income in 2011 for environmental remediation costs will be within this historical range. Management expects cash outlays for environmental remediation costs to be approximately $80 million in 2011 and to range from $50 million to $70 million annually through 2014. It is possible that technological, regulatory and enforcement developments, the results of environmental studies and other factors could alter our expectations with respect to charges against income and future cash outlays. Specifically, the level of expected cash outlays and charges for environmental remediation costs are highly dependent upon activity related to the former chromium manufacturing plant site in New Jersey, as PPG awaits approval of work plans that have been submitted to the applicable regulatory agencies. Impact of Inflation In 2010, PPG experienced a reduction in its primary energy costs but a steady increase in its coatings raw material costs, most notably in the second half of the year. This was driven by higher global demand as a result of the gradual recovery in the global economy and tightness of supply as suppliers have not increased their capacities. This impact was offset by higher selling prices in our Performance Coatings and Architectural Coatings EMEA reportable segments and partially offset in our Industrial Coatings reportable segment. Industrial Coatings partially addressed the remaining impact of raw material inflation 2010 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 21 Table of Contents with further cost reductions in 2010. The impact of inflation net of price was positive in the Optical and Specialty Materials reportable segment and negative in the Commodity Chemicals and Glass reportable segments. In 2009, PPG experienced a reduction in our energy and raw material costs, following the significant increases in these costs experienced in 2008 and 2007, which was driven by lower global demand as a result of the recession and the delayed impact of lower oil prices. This impact was largely offset by reductions in our selling prices. The impact of inflation net of price was negative in our Commodity Chemicals and Glass reportable segments and was positive in our three Coatings and the Optical and Specialty Materials reportable segments. In 2008, through increased selling prices, PPG was able to more than offset the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation, including the impact of higher raw materials and energy costs. In our Commodity Chemicals reportable segment, the increase in our costs due to inflation was more than offset by higher selling prices. In our Performance Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials reportable segments, the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation was offset by higher selling prices. However, in our Industrial Coatings and Glass reportable segments, the increase in our costs due to the negative effects of inflation was not offset by higher selling prices. In 2011, we expect the costs in all our reportable segments to increase due to the negative effects of inflation, most notably the cost of certain raw materials in our coatings segments as a result of increases in global demand for these materials without an associated increase in supply. We will continue our efforts to manage our energy costs. We will also continue our efforts to manage our material costs through product reformulation and qualification of additional suppliers, particularly those from lower cost regions of the world. We expect those efforts, combined with increases in our selling prices, will offset the negative impact of inflation in 2011. Liquidity and Capital Resources During the past three years, we had sufficient financial resources to meet our operating requirements, to fund our capital spending, share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to our shareholders. Cash from operating activities was $1,310 million, $1,345 million and $1,437 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Higher earnings increased cash from operations in 2010 compared to 2009. Cash provided by working capital was greater in 2009 than 2010 and that decline more than offset the cash from higher 2010 earnings. Operating Working Capital is a subset of total working capital and represents (1) trade receivables net of the allowance for doubtful accounts plus (2) inventories on a first in, first out (FIFO) basis less (3) trade creditors liability. See Note 4, Working Capital Detail under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further information related to the components of the Companys Operating Working Capital. We believe Operating Working Capital represents the key components of working capital under the operating control of our businesses. Operating Working Capital at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. A key metric we are using to measure improvement in our working capital management is Operating Working Capital as a percentage of sales (fourth quarter sales annualized). (Millions) 2010 2009 Operating Working Capital $ 2,595 $ 2,671 Operating Working Capital as % of Sales 19.2 % 21.4 % The change in operating working capital elements, excluding the impact of currency, was a reduction of $55 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. This reduction was the net result of an increase in receivables from customers associated with the 2010 increase in sales being more than offset by a larger increase in the trade creditors liability. Receivables, from customers, net, as a percentage of fourth quarter sales, annualized, for 2010 was 18.1%, down slightly from 18.3% for 2009. Days sales outstanding decreased to 66 days in 2010 from 67 days in 2009. Inventories on a FIFO basis as a percentage of fourth quarter sales, annualized, for 2010 was 13.1% down from 14.2% for 2009. Inventory turnover was 5 times in 2010 and 4 times in 2009. Total capital spending was $341 million, $265 million and $2,056 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Spending related to modernization and productivity improvements, expansion of existing businesses and environmental control projects was $307 million, $239 million and $383 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and is expected to be in the range of $375 $425 million during 2011. Capital spending related to business acquisitions amounted to $34 million, $26 million and $1,673 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and expect to use cash in 2011 to fund bolt on acquisitions, as part of a balanced deployment of our cash to support growth in earnings. Dividends paid to shareholders totaled $360 million, $353 million and $343 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. PPG has paid uninterrupted dividends since 1899, and 2010 marked the 39th consecutive year of increased annual dividend payments to shareholders. We did not have a mandatory contribution to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2010; however, due in large part to the negative investment return on pension plan assets in 2009, we made voluntary contributions to 22 2010 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents these plans in 2010 totaling $250 million. In 2009 and 2008, we made voluntary contributions to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans of $360 million (of which $100 million was made in PPG stock) and $50 million, respectively. Contributions were made to our non U.S. defined benefit pension plans of $87 million, $90 million (of which approximately $20 million was made in PPG stock) and $69 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, some of which were required by local funding requirements. In January of 2011, we made an additional voluntary contribution to our U.S. plans of $50 million, and we expect to make mandatory contributions to our non U.S. plans in 2011 of approximately $75 million. The Companys share repurchase activity in 2010, 2009 and 2008 totaled 8.1 million shares at a cost of $586 million, 1.5 million shares at a cost of $59 million and 0.1 million shares at a cost of $7 million, respectively. In October of 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with a counterparty to repurchase up to 1.2 million shares of the Companys stock of which 1.1 million shares were purchased in the open market. The counterparty held the shares until September of 2010 when the Company paid $65 million and took possession of these shares. In December of 2008, the Company entered into an agreement with a counterparty to repurchase 1.5 million shares of the Companys stock. Under the terms of the agreement, the counterparty purchased the shares in the open market in January of 2009 and held the shares until December of 2009 when the Company paid the agreed upon price of $39.53 per share and took possession of these shares. The total cost of this share repurchase was approximately $59 million. On January 2, 2008, PPG completed the acquisition of SigmaKalon, a worldwide coatings producer based in Uithoorn, Netherlands, from global private investment firm Bain Capital (the seller). The acquired business produces architectural, protective and marine and industrial coatings and is a leading coatings supplier in Europe and other key markets across the globe, with an increasing presence in Africa and Asia. The total transaction value was approximately $3.2 billion, consisting of cash paid to the seller of $1,673 million and debt assumed of $1,517 million. On March 18, 2008, PPG completed a public offering of $600 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.75% Notes due 2013 (the 2013 Notes), $700 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.65% Notes due 2018 (the 2018 Notes) and $250 million in aggregate principal amount of its 7.70% Notes due 2038 (the 2038 Notes and, together with the 2013 Notes and the 2018 Notes, the Notes). The Notes were offered by the Company pursuant to its existing shelf registration statement. The proceeds of this offering of $1,538 million (net of discount and issuance costs) and additional borrowings of $195 million under a 650 million revolving credit facility were used to repay existing debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of SigmaKalon. The discount and issuance costs related to the Notes, which totaled $12 million, will be amortized to interest expense over the respective lives of the Notes. In July 2008, the Company entered into an agreement to divest its automotive OEM glass and automotive replacement glass and services businesses (automotive glass and services business). Under the agreement, PPG received a noncontrolling ownership interest in the new company formed by the buyer. The transaction was completed on September 30, 2008. The Company received cash proceeds of $225 million at closing and two six year notes totaling $90 million from this transaction. In the fourth quarter 2008, the Company monetized certain cross currency foreign exchange swap contracts, which had been designated as hedges of our Euro denominated net investment in SigmaKalon, and replaced them with new swap contracts. As a result of these swap monetizations, the Company received $208 million in cash proceeds. See Item 7A of this Form 10 K for further information regarding these instruments. In June 2009, PPG entered into a $400 million three year unsecured term loan. We used $116 million of the proceeds from this term loan to retire our 7.05% Notes due 2009; the remainder of the loan proceeds of approximately $284 million were used to retire outstanding amounts under our former 650 million revolving credit facility. The principal amount of this term loan is due in three years, and the interest rate is variable based on a spread over LIBOR. In August 2010, PPG entered into a three year credit agreement with several banks and financial institutions (the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement provides for a $1.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. In connection with entering into this Credit Agreement, the Company terminated its 650 million and its $1 billion revolving credit facilities that were each set to expire in 2011. There were no outstanding amounts due under either revolving facility at the time of their termination. The Company has the ability to increase the size of the Credit Agreement by up to an additional $300 million, subject to the receipt of lender commitments and other conditions. The Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts outstanding will be due and payable on August 5, 2013. On November 12, 2010, PPG completed a public offering of $250 million in aggregate principal amount of its 1.900% Notes due 2016 (the 2016 Notes), $500 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.600% Notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes) and $250 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.500% Notes due 2040 (the 2040 Notes). These notes were offered by the Company pursuant to its existing shelf registration statement. The proceeds of this 2010 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 23 Table of Contents offering were $983 million (net of discount and issuance costs). We intend to use the proceeds to repay our $400 million three year unsecured term loan due in 2012, contribute to employee pension plans, fund certain asbestos claims and for other general corporate purposes of the Company. The ratio of total debt, including capital leases, to total debt and equity was 53% at December 31, 2010 and 47% at December 31, 2009. The increase at year end 2010 is primarily due to the issuance of additional debt during 2010. We continue to believe that our cash on hand, cash from operations and the Companys available debt capacity will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital spending, including acquisitions, dividend payments, debt service, amounts due under the proposed asbestos settlement, share repurchases, contributions to pension plans, and PPGs significant contractual obligations. These significant contractual obligations, along with amounts due under the proposed asbestos settlement are presented in the following table. Obligations Due In: (Millions) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Contractual Obligations Long term debt $ 4,013 $ 2 $ 1,088 $ 402 $ 2,521 Short term debt 24 24 Capital lease obligations 34 2 4 4 24 Operating leases 665 160 225 135 145 Interest payments(1) 2,007 206 369 322 1,110 Pension contributions(2) 125 125 Unconditional purchase commitments 812 242 238 91 241 Total $ 7,680 $ 761 $ 1,924 $ 954 $ 4,041 Asbestos Settlement(3) Aggregate cash payments $ 825 $ 446 $ 33 $ 5 $ 341 PPG stock and other 132 132 Total $ 957 $ 578 $ 33 $ 5 $ 341 (1) Includes interest on all outstanding debt. Interest for variable rate debt instruments is based on effective rates at December 31, 2010. Interest for fixed rate debt instruments have been adjusted for the impact of interest rate swaps using the effective rate at December 31, 2010. (2) Includes the estimated pension contribution for 2011 only, as PPG is unable to estimate the pension contributions beyond 2011. (3) We have recorded an obligation equal to the net present value of the aggregate cash payments, along with the PPG stock and other assets to be contributed to a trust under the proposed asbestos settlement. However, PPG has no obligation to pay any amounts under this settlement until the Funding Effective Date, as more fully discussed in Note 16, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The unconditional purchase commitments are principally take or pay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials, including industrial gases, natural gas, coal and electricity, consistent with customary industry practice. These amounts also include PPGs commitment to purchase electricity and steam from the RS Cogen joint venture discussed in Note 6, Investments, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. See Note 9, Debt and Bank Credit Agreements and Leases, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit, letters of credit, guarantees and debt covenants. In addition to the amounts available under the lines of credit, the Company has an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC pursuant to which it may issue, offer and sell from time to time on a continuous or delayed basis any combination of securities in one or more offerings. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Companys off balance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase commitments disclosed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in Note 9, Debt and Bank Credit Agreements and Leases, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Estimates Management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under Item 8 of this Form 10 K and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate. We believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies, under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated, and to accounting for pensions, other postretirement benefits, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies. Contingencies, by their nature, relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss. The most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable, to environmental remediation, to pending, impending or overtly threatened litigation against the Company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years. For more information on these matters, see Note 4, Working Capital Detail, Note 14, Income Taxes and Note 16, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works. To accomplish this, extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, turnover, medical costs and discount rates. These assumptions are reviewed annually. See Note 15, Pensions and Other Postretirement 24 2010 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Benefits, under Item 8 for information on these plans and the assumptions used. The discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined by reference to a current yield curve and by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments. The discount rate assumption at December 31, 2010 and for 2011 is 5.35% for our U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. A change in the discount rate of 75 basis points, with all other assumptions held constant, would impact 2011 net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately $12 million and $6 million, respectively. The expected return on plan assets assumption used in accounting for our pension plans is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future long term investment returns. For 2010, the return on plan assets assumption for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans was 8.5%. This assumption will be lowered to 8.0% for 2011. A change in the rate of return of 75 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would impact 2011 net periodic pension expense by approximately $21 million. As discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K, the Company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying values. Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows. Based on this testing, none of our goodwill or identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives was impaired as of December 31, 2010. As part of our ongoing financial reporting process, a collaborative effort is undertaken involving PPG managers with functional responsibility for financial, credit, environmental, legal, tax and benefit matters. The results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments on these contingencies and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements. We believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K related to these contingencies, pensions, other postretirement benefits, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate PPG management, although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates. Currency From December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010, the U.S. dollar strengthened against the euro, the Polish zloty, and the British pound sterling while at the same time it weakened against the Canadian and Australian dollar, the Chinese yuan, the South Korean won, and the Brazilian real, which had a nearly offsetting effect on the translation of the net assets of PPGs operations denominated in non U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar. A $13 million decrease resulted from translating PPGs foreign denominated net assets at December 31, 2010, compared to December 31, 2009. The impact of translating foreign pretax earnings into U.S. dollars was insignificant. From December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009, the U.S. dollar weakened against the currencies of most of the countries in which PPG operates, most notably against the euro, the Canadian dollar, the British pound sterling, the Polish zloty, the Brazilian real, the South Korean won and the Australian dollar. As a result, the effects of translating the net assets of PPGs operations denominated in non U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar increased consolidated net assets at December 31, 2009 by $173 million compared to December 31, 2008. During much of the year, the U.S. dollar was stronger against the currencies of many countries in which PPG operates than it was in 2008, which had an unfavorable impact on 2009 pretax earnings of $29 million from the translation of these foreign earnings into U.S. dollars. From December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008, the U.S. dollar strengthened against the currencies of most of the countries in which PPG operates, most notably against the euro, the British pound sterling, the Polish zloty, the Brazilian real, the South Korean won and the Australian dollar. As a result, the effects of translating the net assets of PPGs operations denominated in non U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar decreased consolidated net assets at December 31, 2008 by $499 million compared to December 31, 2007. During much of the year, the U.S. dollar was weaker against the currencies of many countries in which PPG operates than it was in 2007, which had a favorable impact on 2008 pretax earnings of $45 million from the translation of these foreign earnings into U.S. dollars. Forward Looking Statements The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. Managements Discussion and Analysis and other sections of this Annual Report contain forward looking statements that reflect the Companys current views with respect to future events and financial performance. You can identify forward looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to current or historic facts. Forward looking statements are identified by the use of the words aim, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, project, outlook, forecast and other expressions that indicate future events and trends. Any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the Company 2010 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 25 Table of Contents undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also, note the following cautionary statements. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the Companys forward looking statements. Such factors include global economic conditions, increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors, fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials, the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, the realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring initiatives, difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom, economic and political conditions in international markets, the ability to penetrate existing, developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates, fluctuations in tax rates, the impact of future legislation, the impact of environmental regulations, unexpected business disruptions and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation, including litigation that could result if the proposed asbestos settlement does not become effective. However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, while the list of factors presented here and under Item 1A is considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward looking statements. Consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forward looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties, other factors set forth in Item 1A of this Form 10 K and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk PPG is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and natural gas prices and to changes in PPGs stock price. The Company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks. A detailed description of these exposures and the Companys risk management policies are provided in Note 12, Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Activities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The following disclosures summarize PPGs exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks. Quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible, unfavorable changes in market rates can impact PPGs consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2010 and 2009 were used to hedge PPGs exposure to foreign currency transaction risk. The fair value of these contracts as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 were assets of $2 million and liabilities of $3 million, respectively. The potential reduction in PPGs earnings resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for European currencies and 20% for Asian and South American currencies for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 would have been $22 million and $17 million, respectively. Concurrent with the March 18, 2008 completion of the $1.55 billion public debt offering, PPG entered into ten U.S. dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of $1.3 billion, of which $600 million were to settle on March 15, 2013 and $700 million were to settle on March 15, 2018. On March 18, 2008, PPG paid the counterparties to the contracts a total of $1.3 billion and received euros, which were used to repay most of a 1 billion bridge loan, which the Company employed to finance the acquisition of SigmaKalon. During the fourth quarter of 2008, PPG converted $1.16 billion of these contracts to $208 million of cash and replaced them with new cross currency swap contracts. One contract, with a notional amount of $140 million and a settlement date of March 15, 2018 was converted to cash during the first quarter of 2010. Accordingly, on settlement of the contracts, PPG will receive $1.2 billion and pay euros to the counterparties to the contracts. The Company has designated these swaps as hedges of its net investment in the acquired SigmaKalon businesses and, as a result, mark to fair value adjustments of the swaps have been and will be recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the aggregate fair value of these swaps was a liability of $163 million and $308 million, respectively. A 10% increase in the value of the euro to the U.S. dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts and increased the liability by $158 million and $182 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. PPG had non U.S. dollar denominated debt outstanding of $447 million as of December 31, 2010 and $723 million as of December 31, 2009. A weakening of the U.S. dollar by 10% against European currencies and by 20% against Asian and South American currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately $52 million and $81 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of PPGs interest rate risk. The fair value of the interest rate swaps was an asset of $20 million and $10 million as of 26 2010 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The fair value of these swaps would have changed unfavorably by $1 million and $3 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, if variable interest rates increased by 10%. A 10% increase in interest rates in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in Asia and South America would have affected PPGs variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense approximately $1 million as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. Further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the Companys fixed rate debt by approximately $115 million and $91 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively; however, such changes would not have had an effect on PPGs annual earnings or cash flows. The Company entered into forward starting swaps in the third quarter of 2009 to effectively lock in a fixed interest rate based on the 10 year swap rate, to which will be added a corporate spread, related to future debt refinancings. The notional amount of these swaps totaled $250 million. In the second quarter of 2010, the Company entered into additional forward starting swaps arrangements with a notional amount of $150 million. As of December 31, 2010, the fair value of these swaps was a liability of $21 million. As of December 31, 2009, the fair value of these swaps was an asset of $3 million. A 10% decline in interest rates would unfavorably affect the fair value of these swaps by $14 million and $10 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The fair value of natural gas swap contracts in place as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a liability of $31 million and $50 million, respectively. These contracts were entered into to reduce PPGs exposure to higher prices of natural gas. A 10% reduction in the price of natural gas would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these contracts and increased the liability by $5 million and $14 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. An equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the Companys exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute PPG stock into an asbestos settlement trust (see Note 12 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Activities and Note 16, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K). The fair value of this instrument as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 was an asset of $55 million and $18 million, respectively. A 10% decrease in PPGs stock price would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of this instrument of $12 million and $8 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 2010 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 27 Table of Contents
