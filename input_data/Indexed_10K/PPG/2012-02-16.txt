Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Performance in 2011 compared with 2010 Performance Overview Net sales in 2011 totaled $14,885 million compared to $13,423 million in 2010, an increase of 11 percent. Higher volumes contributed just over 2 percent and higher selling prices increased sales by 5 percent. The remainder of the sales increase was due to the impact of foreign currency translation and acquisitions. The higher sales volumes were achieved in all major geographic regions, while four reportable segments had increased volume levels and the other two had level year over year volumes. Increased demand was driven by stronger global industrial production activity, which aided many of our businesses. The global industrial recovery continued in 2011 with solid growth in emerging regions and North America and with modest improvement in Europe despite a slight decline in volume in the second half of 2011 due to reduced end use market demand for fiber glass and automotive refinish based on softness in the region. Growth rates in Asia in 2011 were reduced by the shrinking level of marine original equipment new ship builds. Growth was impacted early in the year due to the effects of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami and was also tempered late in the year by the negative sales impact stemming from the Thailand floods, particularly in optical products. North American growth was impacted by unscheduled production outages in the Commodity Chemicals segment earlier in 2011 as well as decreased chlorine industry demand in the fourth quarter. Activity in construction markets in the developed regions of the world remained at low levels and has not demonstrated any consistent improvement. Our volume growth for 2011 versus the prior year growth which benefitted from increasing demand as the global industrial economy began to recover from the recession. Also, volumes were flat in the fourth quarter of 2011 as customers curtailed their inventory and were cautious with their order patterns, reflecting economic uncertainty. The improved selling prices in 2011 were achieved in every reporting segment, led by Commodity Chemicals and each of the three coatings segments. The Commodity Chemicals segment achieved pricing gains due to continued strong demand and tightening supply of caustic soda. In our coatings segments, prices were raised in response to persistent raw material cost inflation. The higher coatings selling prices significantly, but did not fully, offset the impact of raw material inflation rates that began to flatten in the fourth quarter. The favorable currency impact was primarily driven by strengthening European, Asian and Latin American currencies against the U.S. dollar compared to 2010, despite a decline in the value of the Euro in the second half of 2011. Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased by $867 million in 2011 to $9,081 million compared to $8,214 million in 2010. About fifty five percent of the increase was driven by inflation, particularly increases in raw material costs, primarily in our coatings businesses. Manufacturing costs were again positive in 2011. Additionally, about 20 percent of the increase in cost of sales was due to sales growth from volume and acquisitions. The effect of foreign currency accounts for about 25 percent of the increase in cost of sales for the year. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 61.0 percent in 2011 compared to 61.2 percent in 2010. This improvement reflects a combination of slightly higher margins on the sales volume growth in 2011 due to improved product mix and the benefit of selling price increases, particularly in Commodity Chemicals, net of the impact of inflation on cost of sales. For the coatings businesses, higher pricing significantly offset inflation, as raw material costs escalated throughout 2011. However, the coatings businesses did not fully offset raw material cost inflation with higher pricing in 2011, and additional pricing actions are underway in 2012 in several businesses to further counter inflation absorbed in 2011. For the Company in total, inflation was more than offset by higher pricing aided by Commodity Chemicals. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $255 million to $3,234 million in 2011 compared to $2,979 million in 2010. The effects of foreign currency, inflation, and growth in costs to support the increased sales volumes and acquisitions were approximately equal. Selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales were 21.7 percent in 2011, down from 22.2 percent in 2010 reflecting the benefit of our continuing effort to aggressively manage our cost growth as our sales volume increases. Interest expense increased $21 million to $210 million in 2011 from $189 million in 2010. This increase was driven by the Companys $1 billion debt issuance in November of 2010 partially offset by an early repayment of $400 million in term loans in June 2011. Interest income increased $8 million to $42 million in 2011 from $34 million in 2010 due to higher average short term investment balances in 2011 compared to 2010. Other charges decreased $11 million to $73 million in 2011 from $84 million in 2010 due principally to the absence of a $6 million antitrust litigation settlement charge which occurred in 2010 and lower environmental remediation expense in 2011 of $5 million. The effective tax rate on pretax earnings in 2011 was approximately 24 percent compared to approximately 32 percent in 2010. The 2011 rate includes a benefit of $12 million resulting from a favorable tax audit settlement. The 2011 rate also includes the impact of the non taxable bargain purchase gain resulting from the Equa Chlor acquisition. The effective rate was 25 percent on the remaining pretax earnings in 2011. 2011 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 17 Table of Contents The 2010 tax rate includes expense of $85 million resulting from the reduction of our previously provided deferred tax asset related to our liability for retiree medical costs. The deferred tax asset needed to be reduced because the healthcare legislation enacted in March 2010 included a provision that reduced the amount of retiree medical costs that will be deductible after December 31, 2012. The 2010 rate also included a $5 million benefit as a result of enacted changes in statutory tax rates outside the U.S. The effective rate was 26 percent on the remaining pretax earnings in 2010. The decrease in the tax rate on the remaining pretax earnings in 2011 is mainly the result of tax planning initiatives in the fourth quarter, the benefit of which are expected to continue in 2012. Net income (attributable to PPG) and earnings per share assuming dilution (attributable to PPG) for 2011 and 2010 are summarized below: (Millions, except per share amounts) Year ended December 31, 2011 Net Income $ EPS Net income (attributable to PPG) $ 1,095 $ 6.87 (Millions, except per share amounts) Year ended December 31, 2010 Net Income $ EPS Net income (attributable to PPG) $ 769 $ 4.63 Net income (attributable to PPG) includes: Charges related to: Charge related to change in U.S. tax law $ 85 $ 0.51 Average shares used to calculate earnings per share assuming dilution were 157.3 million in 2011 and 164.5 million in 2010. The reduction is the result of share buyback activity in 2011. Results of Reportable Business Segments Net sales Segment income (Millions) 2011 2010 2011 2010 Performance Coatings $ 4,626 $ 4,281 $ 673 $ 661 Industrial Coatings 4,158 3,708 438 378 Architectural Coatings EMEA 2,104 1,874 123 113 Optical and Specialty Materials 1,204 1,141 326 307 Commodity Chemicals 1,732 1,434 370 189 Glass 1,061 985 97 74 Performance Coatings sales increased $345 million, or 8 percent, to $4,626 million in 2011. The sales increase was comprised of 5 percent due to price and 3 percent due to currency. Volumes for the segment were slightly favorable as volume increases in automotive refinish and aerospace were offset by low single digit percentage volume declines in the protective and marine coatings and the architectural Americas and Asia Pacific coatings businesses. Aerospace volumes continued to grow reflecting robust industry demand and PPG share gains. Automotive refinish volume increased, but growth was impacted by customer inventory management at year end and weaker European activity levels in the second half of the year. Marine coatings volumes were down reflecting the decline in ship build activity and reduced global shipping during the last quarter of 2011. Improved protective coatings volumes in most regions, reflecting higher energy and infrastructure demand, partly offset the sales decline in marine. U.S. architectural coatings volumes were relatively flat. This included the severely negative volume trends in the U.S. early in 2011 due to weather conditions. Architectural volumes in the emerging regions declined low single digit percentages, including the negative impacts from lower demand near the end of 2011. Segment income in 2011 increased $12 million to $673 million. The impacts of improved volumes in automotive refinish and aerospace, manufacturing cost reductions and favorable currency impacts more than offset the negative impact of inflation net of price to result in the earnings improvement in 2011 compared to 2010. Pricing improved in all businesses reflecting our continuing efforts to address persistent input cost inflation. Looking ahead to the first quarter 2012, lower marine activity levels are expected to continue. Strong aerospace demand is also expected to carry forward. U.S. architectural volumes are anticipated to be flat to modestly improved, while emerging region architectural coatings markets are expected to remain challenging. In addition, we intend to implement higher U.S. architectural pricing based on previously announced price increases. Also, we anticipate less customer inventory management impacts in the segment. Currency impacts for the segment are expected to be negative based on current exchange rates in comparison with the first quarter 2011 exchange rates. Industrial Coatings sales increased $450 million, or 12 percent compared to 2010, to $4,158 million. The sales increase was comprised of 5 percent due to volume, 4 percent due to price and 3 percent due to currency. Segment income improved 16 percent versus 2010 to $438 million in 2011. This increase was primarily due to increased volumes, lower manufacturing costs and currency, partially offset by the negative impact of inflation net of increases in selling prices and growth driven increases in overhead costs. Segment volume grew by 5 percent on solid global industrial demand, with positive results in all three business units. Growth rates were robust in Asia as a result of continued growth in the region for all three businesses. The automotive OEM business delivered strong single digit percentage growth reflecting high growth rates due to the automotive industry recovery with continued growth in North America, Asia Pacific and Latin America, and low growth in Europe where volumes were positive for the full year but weakened in the second half of the year. Global volumes in the industrial and packaging businesses were also favorable with Asia Pacific the strongest region delivering the majority of the growth, with somewhat lower or even declining volumes in Europe and North America due, in part, to late year customer destocking. 18 2011 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Looking ahead, we anticipate continued volume growth, including higher global auto production and strong general industrial activity. We also anticipate further price increases to restore margin lost to raw material inflation in 2011. Currency is expected to be negative to sales and earnings in the first quarter. Architectural Coatings EMEA sales increased $230 million, or 12 percent, to $2,104 million in 2011. The sales increase was comprised of 5 percent due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation, a 1 percent increase from acquired business and the remainder from an increase in selling prices and volume gains. Segment earnings were up $10 million compared to the prior year. Positive year over year earnings resulted from the earnings impact of volume growth and currency translation. Earnings in 2011 were reduced by a $9 million charge related to a U.K. based retail do it yourself customer who filed for bankruptcy during the second quarter of 2011 and the adverse impact of inflation net of price increases. Looking ahead, we anticipate soft demand to continue in Europe as we begin 2012. First quarter 2012 results will also include the results of the Dyrup acquisition, which closed in January 2012. We anticipate negative currency translation impacts given the segments large Euro base of sales and earnings and the decline in the value of the Euro compared with the first quarter of 2011. Optical and Specialty Materials sales for 2011 increased $63 million, or 6 percent, compared to 2010, to $1,204 million due to a 2 percent increase in volumes, pricing and the favorable impact of currency. Earnings grew by 6 percent to $326 million. Both optical products and silicas achieved sales growth coming from higher volumes, pricing and the impact of currency. The silicas business volumes benefitted from the higher automotive OEM production resulting in increased demand for our products sold into the tire and battery markets. Segment results were tempered by the negative impact from the serious flooding in Thailand that disrupted optical customers and supply chains. The flooding also impacted production of PPGs optical materials, resulting in a declaration of force majeure during the fourth quarter. Segment earnings increased due to the factors increasing sales, which exceeded the impact of inflation, higher manufacturing costs and volume driven growth in overhead cost. Looking ahead, we do not anticipate any notable 2012 residual impact from the Thailand flooding, as we approached normal operations at the end of December. We expect a normal seasonal uptick for optical in the first quarter and Transitions&reg; growth to resume driven by market growth and share gain versus clear lenses in emerging regions. In addition, we are commercializing Vantage&reg; our new Transitions&reg; clear to polarized product in the first half of 2012, and we expect increased marketing costs associated with the launch of this new product. We also anticipate recent silica market trends to continue, aided by higher auto production and the tire industry focus on improving fuel efficiency through higher silica content in tires. Similar to other global PPG businesses, currency is expected to have a negative year over year impact in the first quarter. Commodity Chemicals sales in 2011 versus the prior year increased $298 million, or 21 percent, to $1,732 million. Higher pricing and the impact of the EquaChlor acquisition were the key factors producing the improved sales and earnings. Segment earnings increased $181 million to $370 million in 2011. Capacity utilization was lower in the second, third and fourth quarters due to planned and unplanned production outages, as well as lower chlorine industry demand in the fourth quarter due to customer inventory management and lower chlorine derivative exports, resulting in higher manufacturing and maintenance expenses. Natural gas unit costs were lower year over year, but ethylene costs were higher. An increase in overhead costs was substantially offset by gains from asset sales, primarily related to the lease of Marcellus Shale natural gas drilling rights on PPG owned property, and lower environmental expense. Looking forward, we anticipate higher chlorine demand in the first quarter of 2012 sequentially versus the fourth quarter of 2011 due to both seasonal factors and modest customer inventory restocking. This would result in improved capacity utilization compared to the fourth quarter, but still lower versus an exceptionally strong operating rate in the first quarter 2011. Caustic inventory is extremely low, and we intend to implement announced caustic price increases in the first quarter. Also, the current natural gas market price has declined below $3.00 per unit. Glass sales increased $76 million, or 8 percent, compared to 2010 to $1,061 million in 2011. Sales increased 4 percent due to pricing, 2 percent due to volume growth with the remainder attributable to favorable foreign currency impacts. Solid fiber glass pricing gains drove the sales growth, together with improved flat glass volumes. Fiber glass volumes were also up over 2010, but were lower in the fourth quarter of 2011 due to lower European demand. Segment earnings grew to $97 million, compared to $74 million a year ago. Higher sales prices and volumes were the primary drivers of the earnings improvement. The earnings results were tempered somewhat by raw material cost inflation, higher fiber glass maintenance costs and higher overhead costs. 2011 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 19 Table of Contents Looking forward, we anticipate fiber glass volume trends to be sequentially comparable with the second half of 2011 which was down versus the first half, which may adversely impact pricing. Flat glass activity is also expected to be comparable with the second half of 2011. We also expect the electronics market to remain weak especially against strong first quarter 2011 comparables adversely impacting our fiber glass equity earnings. Cost control is a perennial focus for this segment. Outlook At the beginning of 2011, overall activity levels in most major global economies and for most end use markets were experiencing year over year growth, although levels in the developed regions were still below the pre recession rates of 2008. In many emerging regions, economic activity surpassed the pre recession pace due, in part, to continued, solid industrial and infrastructure growth in those regions. One notable exception to the 2011 recovery was the construction markets in the developed regions, which remained static at extremely low activity levels in comparison with the past decade. During the middle of 2011, growth rates slowed in most economic sectors and regions, as concerns emerged over government debt levels, fiscal policy and associated austerity measures. Late in the year, the pace of all major economies slowed, reflecting heightened concerns over the potential financial crisis stemming from government indebtedness and related actions, particularly in the Euro zone. The North American economy generally followed the global trends with improving overall industrial and chemical activity aided by lower regional energy costs due to increased availability of natural gas stemming from the success of shale gas drilling. This lower feedstock cost resulted in higher export activity due to the favorable regional energy cost input advantages. Also aiding the industrial recovery was continued, solid improvement in automotive OEM production. Although production levels grew throughout the year, they were still considerably lower than pre recession levels. Similar to 2010, construction markets showed initial signs of a potential recovery early in the year, but optimism faded, and activity levels were flat until very modest improvements were evidenced late in the year. Unemployment rates, impasses on government policy and concerns over the global economy served as additional factors which limited the rate of economic growth in the region. Despite these limitations, the region ended the year with more growth promise than many other major developed regional economies. At the outset of 2011, growth in the European economy continued to underperform most other major economies as concerns heightened over government budget deficits and their ability to sustain or refinance government debt loads. Anxiety rose throughout the year as global financial markets grew more concerned with European sovereign debt loads. Government action was subdued, due in part to disagreement within the European Union over a course of action, and also due to the already high level of government economic support within the region. Economic activity, which began the year slowly, faded and demand in many end use markets served by PPG turned negative late in the year. The region ended the year weaker and with no clear catalyst to initiate a recovery. Many of the major emerging economies, such as those in Asia Pacific and Latin America, were expanding entering 2011, aided by continued growth in exports, expansion of their domestic markets and improved energy or rare earth mineral availability. Inflation concerns in these emerging regions served to either dampen demand or caused governments to take action with the same objective. Growth rates, however, remained above those in developed regions, with a slowly shifting emphasis toward internal consumption partly offsetting slower or no growth in exports from the regions. Entering 2012, the expectation is for the pace of economic activity to continue to vary by region. In North America, most major sectors of the economy are expected to strengthen as the recovery continues to gradually move the economy back toward pre recession levels. This increased activity level is expected to be led by higher industrial and chemical production, while improvement in construction is likely to be modest and inconsistent. The 2012 growth rate in emerging regions is expected to continue to moderate and be more erratic, but still outpace that of the developed regions. The European economy is expected to mildly contract in early 2012, despite some growth in exports, but there is downside risk the economic conditions in Europe could be even weaker in 2012. Since the middle of 2010, commodity and oil prices have experienced inflation due to tight supply stemming from manufacturing capacity remaining idled or removed from service during the recession and improving demand for commodities. It is anticipated that prices will remain at elevated levels during the first half of 2012. PPG typically experiences fluctuating prices for energy and raw materials used in many of our businesses. Factors which impact our input prices are supply/demand imbalances, global industrial activity levels and changes in supplier feedstock costs. Over the past two years combined, PPGs coatings raw material costs have inflated by about $650 million. Our current forecast for the early portion of 2012 is for overall coatings raw material prices to be flat with year end 2011 levels but up in comparison to full year 2011 reflecting the fact that costs rose during 2011. Given the volatility in supply/demand, energy cost and the currency environment, it is not feasible to project full year 2012 raw material pricing. 20 2011 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Changes in natural gas pricing have a significant impact on the financial performance of our Commodity Chemicals and Glass segments. Each one dollar change in our unit cost of natural gas per million British Thermal Units has a direct impact of approximately $60 million to $70 million on our annual operating costs. Our 2011 natural gas costs averaged approximately $4.65 per mmbtu for the year, while our 2010 costs averaged about $5.50 per unit. We currently estimate the market cost for natural gas in the first quarter of 2012 will be between $2.50 and $3.00 per mmbtu. We currently have about 10 percent of full year 2012 U.S. natural gas needs hedged at an average price of about $4.50 per unit from hedges placed prior to 2012. While it remains difficult to predict future natural gas prices, in order to reduce the risks associated with volatile prices, we will continue to use a variety of techniques, which include reducing consumption through improved manufacturing processes, switching to alternative fuels and hedging. In an effort to offset the adverse impact of raw material cost inflation on earnings during 2011, PPG initiated higher selling prices in all operating segments. The Company has historically raised selling prices to counteract the negative earnings impact from inflation. Higher pricing in 2011 did not fully counter inflation in our coatings segments for the full year, but the offset grew higher each quarter of the year. We intend to implement additional pricing for 2012 to further offset the inflation absorbed in 2011. Commodity Chemicals pricing improved during the year, but fell modestly in the fourth quarter due to lower chlorine demand. Our pension and postretirement benefit costs were about $230 million in 2011, a decrease of approximately $30 million from 2010, which included the benefit of a plan change in January 2011. These costs are expected to increase in 2012 by about $35 million to $45 million primarily due to the reduction in the discount rate consistent with the decline of interest rates. During 2011, PPGs cash contributions to our pension plans totaled $121 million following cash contributions of $340 and $330 million, in 2010 and 2009, respectively, and we anticipate 2012 contributions will be in the range of $130 million to $150 million. We expect our ongoing tax rate in 2012 to be in the range of 25 percent to 26 percent, consistent with the 2011 rate. The reduction we have achieved in 2011 in our ongoing tax rate reflects the impact from tax planning strategies and our sales and earnings growth outside the U.S. where corporate income tax rates are lower, particularly in Asia Pacific and Europe. A similar benefit from these tax planning strategies is expected to impact the 2012 effective tax rate. Because of the differences in regional tax rates, a shift in the geographic mix of our earnings will impact our ongoing tax rate. The Companys cash generation has been consistent and at or near record levels over the past four years, despite the recession and a significant increase in the level of voluntary pension contributions. Over the past two years, the Company has repurchased over 17.9 million shares of stock at a cost of $1.4 billion, and the Company ended the year with approximately 9 million shares left under the current authorization from the Board of Directors. The Company entered 2012 with about $1.5 billion in cash and short term investments, which remains at a historically high level for the Company. We completed the previously announced acquisitions of Dyrup and Colpisa in January 2012 to strengthen our coatings businesses by broadening their product offerings and extending their operations into new geographic areas. The sales of these businesses in 2011 were approximately $300 million. We anticipate making additional acquisitions in 2012 as part of our strategy for accelerating growth. We will remain disciplined and deploy our cash in ways that will support future earnings growth, and we are targeting to end 2012 with less than $1 billion in cash and short term investments. Our current economic outlook for 2012 is for global growth to continue, but we expect it to be uneven by region. Growth in Asia Pacific will be higher than the other regions of the world. In contrast, we expect to see economic contraction in Europe in the first half of 2012, and the level of uncertainty concerning the credit crisis in that region increases the risk that the economy there will weaken further. Considering the expected ongoing global growth coupled with our broad geographic footprint and extensive end use market exposure, we expect to see overall higher demand in 2012 versus 2011. PPG intends to remain proactive in managing our businesses to address these varied market conditions and level of economic uncertainty. PPG has in the past initiated cost reduction actions in response to lower end market demand and downward pressure on our margins. These actions have included strict management of discretionary costs and, in some cases, restructuring actions focused on lowering our fixed cost structure. Accounting Standards Adopted in 2011 Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under Item 8 describes the Companys recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Accounting Standards to be Adopted in Future Years Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under Item 8 describes accounting pronouncements that have been promulgated prior to December 31, 2011 but are not effective until a future date. 2011 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 21 Table of Contents Performance in 2010 compared with 2009 Performance Overview Net sales in 2010 totaled $13,423 million compared to $12,239 million in 2009, an increase of 10 percent. Higher volumes contributed 8 percent and higher selling prices increased sales by 1 percent. The remainder of the sales increase was due to foreign currency and acquisitions. The higher sales volumes were achieved in all major geographic regions and in all reportable segments, with the exception of Architectural Coatings EMEA, reflecting the partial recovery in demand from the impact of the global recession. Our overall volume growth was driven by automotive OEM coatings growth of almost 30 percent, while continuing weakness in construction and maintenance markets reduced architectural coatings volumes in Europe, as demand declines remained at about 5 percent throughout the year. Growth in North America was driven by improving industrial activity, especially in new automotive builds, aerospace, transportation and consumer products. Sales in Europe did increase slightly for the year although the rate of recovery in the European economy underperformed in comparison with most other major economies. This was driven by recurring concerns over governmental spending and the ability to sustain or refinance government debt loads which caused many major European countries to initiate significant austerity measures. The major emerging economies in which we operate, such as Asia and Latin America, maintained late 2009 economic momentum and grew throughout 2010, in many cases surpassing pre recession economic activity levels. Industrial growth rates remained high, including mid teen percentage growth in China. The companys record sales in emerging regions reflects the measurable benefits from PPGs strategic initiatives to broaden end use markets served and improve our penetration in the rapid growth regions. Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased by $675 million in 2010 to $8,214 million compared to $7,539 million in 2009. About 80 percent of the increase was due to volume growth. Additionally, about 40 percent of the increase was driven by inflation, offset by a decrease of nearly 25 percent in manufacturing costs which was a result of the restructuring and cost savings initiatives taken by the Company. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 61.2 percent in 2010 compared to 61.6 percent in 2009. The impact of inflation on cost of sales in 2010 was offset by increases in selling prices and lower manufacturing costs. The incremental sales volume in 2010 delivered an above average gross margin. These factors combined to produce the reduction in cost of sales as a percentage of sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $43 million to $2,979 million in 2010 compared to $2,936 million in 2009. Nearly half of the increase was due to the effects of inflation, more than 35 percent due to increased sales volumes and approximately 15 percent due to the effects of foreign currency. The increase was offset partially by specific overhead cost reduction actions. Selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales were 22.2 percent in 2010, down from 24.0 percent in 2009 as incremental volume growth was achieved without significant increases in selling costs. During the first quarter of 2009, the Company finalized a restructuring plan that was focused on further reducing PPGs global cost structure. The Company recorded a charge of $186 million for the cost of these restructuring actions. Other charges increased $19 million to $84 million in 2010 from $65 million in 2009 due principally to $10 million higher environmental remediation expense compared to 2009 and a $6 million antitrust litigation settlement charge. Other earnings increased $30 million to $180 million in 2010 from $150 million in 2009 due primarily to higher equity earnings and royalties, offset partially by the absence of gains on non operating asset sales that occurred in 2009. The effective tax rate on pretax earnings in 2010 was 32.0 percent compared to 31.0 percent in 2009. The 2010 rate includes expense of $85 million resulting from the reduction of our previously provided deferred tax asset related to our liability for retiree medical costs. The deferred tax asset needed to be reduced because the U.S. healthcare legislation enacted in March 2010 included a provision that reduced the amount of retiree medical costs that will be deductible after December 31, 2012. The 2010 rate also included a $5 million benefit as a result of enacted changes in statutory tax rates outside the U.S. The rate was approximately 26 percent on the remaining pretax earnings in 2010. The 2009 rate includes a tax benefit of $2 million related to audit settlements and a tax benefit of 24.5 percent related to the business restructuring charge. The rate was approximately 30 percent on the remaining pretax earnings in 2009. The decrease in the tax rate on the remaining pretax earnings in 2010 is mainly the result of shifts in the geographic mix of pretax earnings to lower taxed regions of the world. 22 2011 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Net income (attributable to PPG) and earnings per share assuming dilution (attributable to PPG) for 2010 and 2009 are summarized below: (Millions, except per share amounts) Year ended December 31, 2010 Net Income $ EPS Net income (attributable to PPG) $ 769 $ 4.63 Net income (attributable to PPG) includes: Charges related to: Change in U.

The sales increase was comprised of 3 percent due to price and 2 percent due to currency. Volumes for the segment were slightly positive as volume increases in automotive refinish, aerospace and protective and marine coatings were offset by a mid single digit percentage volume decline in the architectural Americas and Asia Pacific coatings business. The growth in the automotive refinish business was a result of market share gains and recovery from the customer destocking in 2009. Aerospace and protective and marine coatings also achieved solid volume growth due to strong growth in both emerging and developed regions. These businesses both have a sizeable after market component, serve late economic cycle industries and did not experience the same degree of volume decline during the recession as most of our other businesses. Segment income in 2010 increased $110 million to $661 million. The increase in earnings resulted from the impact of higher sales volume, improved sales margin mix, lower overhead costs and favorable currency. The negative earnings impact of inflation was offset by favorable pricing and lower manufacturing costs. The increase in income was led by automotive refinish, protective and marine coatings and aerospace businesses as all benefited from partial volume recovery and lower costs as a result of our cost savings initiatives. Industrial Coatings sales increased $640 million or 21 percent compared to 2009, to $3,708 million. The sales increase was comprised of 19 percent due to volume, 1 percent due to price and 1 percent due to currency translation. Volume growth was led by the automotive OEM and industrial businesses emerging regions, both reflecting the continuing, gradual recovery from the global recession. Segment income improved 138 percent versus 2009 to $378 million in 2010. This increase was primarily due to increased volumes and lower manufacturing and overhead costs, partially offset by the negative impact of inflation net of increases in selling prices. Earnings returned closer to pre recession levels as this segment was the most impacted segment by the recession. Architectural Coatings EMEA sales decreased $78 million or 4 percent, to $1,874 million in 2010. The sales decrease was comprised of 4 percent due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation and a 2 percent decline in sales volume, which includes the positive impact of some small acquisitions, offset by a 2 percent increase in selling prices. Volume trends remained consistent throughout 2010, declining by mid single digit percentages, reflecting continued general sluggishness in the European construction and maintenance markets. There were solid price gains made in response to higher raw materials costs. Segment income decreased $15 million to $113 million in 2010. The negative earnings impact of lower sales volumes was only partially offset by lower overhead costs and the positive impact of price increases, net of inflation. Optical and Specialty Materials sales for 2010 increased $139 million or 14 percent compared to 2009, to $1,141 million due almost entirely to increased volumes in both the optical and silicas businesses. Both the optical products and silicas businesses delivered double digit volume growth in each quarter during 2010. As a result, segment sales and earnings results for the year were all time records. Increased sales penetration was achieved in the end use market for Transitions&reg; lens products, including about 20 percent growth in emerging regions. Volume recovery momentum continued in silicas in large part due to the recovery in several silicas end use markets, including automotive OEM production. Segment income increased $72 million to $307 million in 2010 primarily due to the improved volumes, partially offset by higher selling and advertising costs to support the increased optical volumes. 2011 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 23 Table of Contents Commodity Chemicals sales in 2010 versus the prior year increased $161 million or 13 percent, to $1,434 million. Sales improved 15 percent due to higher volumes, driven by the economic recovery in 2010 partially offset by a 3 percent decline in pricing for the year. The impact of foreign currency translation was slightly positive. Segment income increased $37 million to $189 million in 2010 due to the impact of the higher volumes as well as favorable manufacturing and overhead costs resulting from our cost savings initiatives. Factors partially offsetting the earnings improvement were the impact of the lower pricing and input cost inflation. Glass sales increased $136 million or 16 percent compared to 2009 to $985 million in 2010. Sales increased 18 percent due to volume growth offset by a 2 percent reduction in pricing. The sales volume improvement was largely in the fiber glass business resulting from higher demand as a result of the improved global economy. The lower flat glass pricing was a result of the continued sluggishness in the residential and commercial construction markets. Segment income increased $113 million to $74 million in 2010 due primarily to the impact of the higher fiber glass sales volumes, lower manufacturing costs as a result of our restructuring and cost savings initiatives, and higher fiber glass equity earnings, which reflect the overall improvement in the global demand for electronics, partially offset by the impact of the lower flat glass pricing. See Note 24, Reportable Business Segment Information, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further information related to the Companys operating segments and reportable business segments. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, including Environmental Matters PPG is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against others, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Note 15, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for a description of certain of these lawsuits, including a description of the proposed asbestos settlement. As discussed in Item 3 and Note 15, although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable, management believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving PPG, including asbestos related claims in the event the proposed asbestos settlement described in Note 15 does not become effective, will not have a material effect on PPGs consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. It is PPGs policy to accrue expenses for environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted. In managements opinion, the Company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the Companys environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on PPGs financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. Management anticipates that the resolution of the Companys environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, PPG had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling $226 million and $272 million, respectively, of which $59 million and $83 million, respectively, were classified as current liabilities. Pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2011, 2010 and 2009 totaled $16 million, $21 million and $11 million, respectively, and are included in Other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of income. Cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated $59 million, $34 million and $24 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased the liability by $3 million in 2011 and by $2 million in 2010. In addition to the amounts currently reserved for environmental remediation, the Company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as $200 million to $400 million. Such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence. About 50% of this reasonably possible loss relates to New Jersey Chrome. Our continuing efforts to analyze and assess the environmental issues associated with New Jersey Chrome and at the Calcasieu River Estuary located near our Lake Charles, La., chlor alkali plant resulted in a pre tax charge of $173 million in the third quarter of 2006 for the estimated costs of remediating these sites. These charges for estimated environmental remediation costs in 2006 were significantly higher than PPGs historical range. Excluding 2006, pretax charges against income for environmental remediation have ranged between $10 million and $35 million per year for the past 15 years. Information is being generated from the continuing remedial investigation activities related to New Jersey Chrome that will be incorporated into a final remedial action work plan to be submitted in mid 2012 which may result in an increase to the existing reserve. 24 2011 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Management expects cash outlays for environmental remediation costs to range from $50 million to $70 million annually through 2016. It is possible that technological, regulatory and enforcement developments, the results of environmental studies and other factors could alter our expectations with respect to charges against income and future cash outlays. Specifically, the level of expected cash outlays and charges for environmental remediation costs are highly dependent upon activity related to New Jersey Chrome, as PPG expects to submit additional remedial action work plans to the applicable regulatory agencies in 2012. Impact of Inflation In 2011, PPG experienced a reduction in the price of natural gas, its primary energy cost, but experienced a significant rise in ethylene, a Commodity Chemical raw material and in coatings raw material prices. Coatings raw materials both organic, primarily petroleum based, and inorganic materials, generally comprise 70 to 80 percent of coatings cost of goods sold in most coatings formulations and represent PPGs single largest production cost component. In 2011, overall coatings raw materials costs inflated by approximately 10 to 12 percent for the Company. The largest inflation impacts were from titanium dioxide pigments and certain propylene based resins. This impact was not entirely offset by higher selling prices in our Performance Coatings and Architectural Coatings EMEA reportable segments. There was also a coverage gap in our Industrial Coatings reportable segment even with this segment using product reformulations to attempt to counter this impact. Our Commodity Chemicals and Glass reportable segments were able to more than fully offset the impact of inflation with price increases, while inflation was not significant for our Optical and Specialty Materials reportable segment. In 2010, PPG experienced a reduction in its primary energy costs but a steady increase in its coatings raw material costs, most notably in the second half of the year. This was driven by higher global demand as a result of the gradual recovery in the global economy and tightness of supply as suppliers have not increased their capacities. This impact was offset by higher selling prices in our Performance Coatings and Architectural Coatings EMEA reportable segments and partially offset in our Industrial Coatings reportable segment. Industrial Coatings partially addressed the remaining impact of raw material inflation with further cost reductions in 2010. The impact of inflation net of price was positive in the Optical and Specialty Materials reportable segment and negative in the Commodity Chemicals and Glass reportable segments. In 2009, PPG experienced a reduction in our energy and raw material costs, following the significant increases in these costs experienced in 2008 and 2007, which was driven by lower global demand as a result of the recession and the delayed impact of lower oil prices. This impact was largely offset by reductions in our selling prices. The impact of inflation net of price was negative in our Commodity Chemicals and Glass reportable segments and was positive in our three Coatings and the Optical and Specialty Materials reportable segments. In 2012, we expect the majority of our raw material costs in all of our coatings reportable segments to stabilize, although the price of some raw materials are expected to remain volatile and to result in inflation while others have declined. The Company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to support its continuous efforts to find the lowest raw material costs. These initiatives include reformulation of our products using both petroleum derived and bio based materials as part of a product renewal strategy, qualifying multiple and local sources of supply, including suppliers from Asia and other lower cost regions of the world, and strategic initiatives with multiple global suppliers to secure and enhance PPGs supply of titanium dioxide and other materials. We expect these efforts, combined with increases in our selling prices, will offset the negative impact of inflation on our coatings businesses in 2012 and recover margin lost from inflation absorbed in 2011. It is expected, however, that our selling prices may not be able to cover raw material increases in certain of our segments. The Company will look to other cost control measures to attempt to manage this negative impact on these reportable segments. We will also continue our efforts to manage our energy costs in 2012. 2011 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 25 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources During the past three years, we had sufficient financial resources to meet our operating requirements, to fund our capital spending, share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to our shareholders. Cash from operating activities was $1,436 million, $1,310 million, and $1,345 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Higher earnings increased cash from operations in 2011 compared to 2010, but the increase was reduced by cash used to fund an increase in working capital of $212 million driven by our sales growth in 2011. Cash provided by working capital was greater in 2009 than 2010 and that decline was more than offset by the cash from higher 2010 earnings. Operating Working Capital is a subset of total working capital and represents (1) trade receivables net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, plus (2) inventories on a first in, first out (FIFO) basis, less (3) trade creditors liabilities. See Note 3, Working Capital Detail under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further information related to the components of the Companys Operating Working Capital. We believe Operating Working Capital represents the key components of working capital under the operating control of our businesses. Operating Working Capital at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. A key metric we use to measure our working capital management is Operating Working Capital as a percentage of sales (fourth quarter sales annualized). (Millions) 2011 2010 Operating Working Capital $ 2,739 $ 2,595 Operating Working Capital as % of Sales 19.5 % 19.2 % The change in operating working capital elements, excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions, was an increase of $195 million during the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was the net result of an increase in receivables from customers associated with the 2011 increase in sales and an increase in FIFO inventory slightly offset by an increase in trade creditors liabilities. Trade receivables from customers, net, as a percentage of fourth quarter sales, annualized, for 2011 was 17.9 percent, down slightly from 18.1 percent for 2010. Days sales outstanding was 66 days in 2011, level with 2010. Inventories on a FIFO basis as a percentage of fourth quarter sales, annualized, for 2011 was 13.1 percent level with 2010. Inventory turnover was 5.0 times in 2011 and 4.6 times in 2010. Total capital spending, including acquisitions, was $446 million, $341 million and $265 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Spending related to modernization and productivity improvements, expansion of existing businesses and environmental control projects was $390 million, $307 million and $239 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, and is expected to be in the range of $450 $550 million during 2012. Capital spending, excluding acquisitions, as a percentage of sales was 2.6%, 2.3% and 2.0% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Capital spending related to business acquisitions amounted to $56 million, $34 million, and $26 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and expect to use cash in 2012 to fund small to mid sized acquisitions, as part of a balanced deployment of our cash to support growth in earnings. In January 2012, the Company closed the previously announced acquisitions of Colpisa, a Colombian producer of automotive OEM and refinish coatings, and Dyrup, a European architectural coatings company. The cost of these acquisitions, including assumed debt, was $193 million. Dividends paid to shareholders totaled $355 million, $360 million and $353 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. PPG has paid uninterrupted annual dividends since 1899, and 2011 marked the 40th consecutive year of increased annual dividend payments to shareholders. We did not have a mandatory contribution to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2011; however, we made voluntary contributions to these plans in 2011 totaling $50 million. In 2010 and 2009, we made voluntary contributions to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans of $250 and $360 million (of which $100 million was made in PPG stock), respectively. We expect to make voluntary contributions to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2012 of up to $60 million. Contributions were made to our non U.S. defined benefit pension plans of $71 million, $87 million and $90 million (of which approximately $20 million was made in PPG stock) for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, some of which were required by local funding requirements. We expect to make mandatory contributions to our non U.S. plans in 2012 of approximately $90 million. The Companys share repurchase activity in 2011, 2010 and 2009 was 10.2 million shares at a cost of $858 million, 8.1 million shares at a cost of $586 million and 1.5 million shares at a cost of $59 million, respectively. We expect to make share repurchases in 2012 as part of our cash deployment focused on earnings growth. The amount of spending will depend on the level of acquisition spending and other uses of cash, but we currently expect to spend in the range of $250 million to $500 million on share repurchases in 2012. We can repurchase about 9 million shares under the current authorization from the Board of Directors. 26 2011 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents In June 2011, the Company repaid a $400 million three year unsecured term loan, which had a scheduled maturity date of June 2012. There was no prepayment penalty. This $400 million three year unsecured loan was entered into in June 2009 with a variable interest rate based on a spread over the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR). This term loan was repaid using a portion of the proceeds from the $1 billion debt we issued in November 2010. On November 12, 2010, PPG completed a public offering of $250 million in aggregate principal amount of its 1.900% Notes due 2016, $500 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.600% Notes due 2020 and $250 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.500% Notes due 2040. These notes were offered by the Company pursuant to its existing shelf registration statement. The proceeds of this offering were $983 million (net of discount and issuance costs). We used the proceeds to repay $400 million in term debt and to contribute to employee pension plans and we intend to use the remainder of the proceeds to fund certain asbestos claims and for other general corporate purposes of the Company. In August 2010, PPG entered into a three year credit agreement with several banks and financial institutions (the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement provides for a $1.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. In connection with entering into this Credit Agreement, the Company terminated its 650 million and its $1 billion revolving credit facilities that were each set to expire in 2011. There were no outstanding amounts due under either revolving facility at the time of their termination. The Company has the ability to increase the size of the Credit Agreement by up to an additional $300 million, subject to the receipt of lender commitments and other conditions. The Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts outstanding will be due and payable on August 5, 2013. There were no amounts outstanding under the credit agreement at December 31, 2011; however, the available borrowing rate on a one month, U.S. dollar denominated borrowing would have been 1.05 percent. PPG entered into $400 million of forward starting swaps in 2009 and 2010, which are set to expire during 2012. The Company plans to issue 10 year debt in connection with the expiration of these instruments and intends to use the proceeds from this issuance in 2013 to repay the $600 million in notes due in 2013. The ratio of total debt, including capital leases, to total debt and equity was 53% at December 31, 2011 and 2010. No deferred U.S. income taxes have been provided on undistributed earnings of non U.S. subsidiaries, which amounted to $2,920 million as of December 31, 2011 and $2,465 million as of December 31, 2010. These earnings are considered to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time or will be repatriated when it is tax effective to do so. It is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings. We continue to believe that our cash on hand, cash from operations and the Companys available debt capacity will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital spending, including acquisitions, dividend payments, debt service, amounts due under the proposed asbestos settlement, share repurchases, contributions to pension plans, and PPGs significant contractual obligations. These significant contractual obligations, along with amounts due under the proposed asbestos settlement are presented in the following table. Obligations Due In: (Millions) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Contractual Obligations Long term debt $ 3,617 $ 73 $ 611 $ 808 $ 2,125 Short term debt 33 33 Capital lease obligations 32 2 4 4 22 Operating leases 643 162 221 129 131 Interest payments(1) 1,775 195 323 286 971 Pension contributions(2) 150 150 Unconditional purchase commitments 742 253 211 78 200 Total $ 6,992 $ 868 $ 1,370 $ 1,305 $ 3,449 Asbestos Settlement(3) Aggregate cash payments $ 825 $ 462 $ 23 $ 21 $ 319 PPG stock and other 131 131 Total $ 956 $ 593 $ 23 $ 21 $ 319 (1) Includes interest on all outstanding debt. Interest for variable rate debt instruments is based on effective rates at December 31, 2011. Interest for fixed rate debt instruments have been adjusted for the impact of interest rate swaps using the effective rate at December 31, 2011. (2) Includes the estimated pension contribution for 2012 only, as PPG is unable to estimate the pension contributions beyond 2012. (3) We have recorded an obligation equal to the net present value of the aggregate cash payments, along with the PPG stock and other assets to be contributed to a trust under the proposed asbestos settlement. However, PPG has no obligation to pay any amounts under this settlement until the Funding Effective Date, as more fully discussed in Note 15, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The unconditional purchase commitments are principally take or pay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials, including industrial gases, natural gas, coal and electricity, consistent with customary industry practice. These amounts also include PPGs commitment to purchase electricity and steam from our RS Cogen joint venture discussed in Note 5, Investments, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. See Note 8, Debt and Bank Credit Agreements and Leases, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit, letters of credit, guarantees and debt covenants. 2011 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 27 Table of Contents In addition to the amounts available under the lines of credit, the Company has an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC pursuant to which it may issue, offer and sell from time to time on a continuous or delayed basis any combination of securities in one or more offerings. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Companys off balance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase commitments disclosed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in Note 8, Debt and Bank Credit Agreements and Leases, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Estimates Management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under Item 8 of this Form 10 K and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate. We believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies, under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated, and to accounting for pensions, other postretirement benefits, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies. Contingencies, by their nature, relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss. The most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectability of accounts receivable, to environmental remediation, to pending, impending or overtly threatened litigation against the Company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years. For more information on these matters, see Note 3, Working Capital Detail, Note 13, Income Taxes and Note 15, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works. To accomplish this, extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, turnover, medical costs and discount rates. The Company has established a process by which management reviews and selects these assumptions annually. See Note 14, Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, under Item 8 for information on these plans and the assumptions used. The discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined by reference to a current yield curve and by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments. The discount rate assumption at December 31, 2011 and for 2012 is 4.50% for our U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. A change in the discount rate of 75 basis points, with all other assumptions held constant, would impact 2012 net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately $10 million and $8 million, respectively. The expected return on plan assets assumption used in accounting for our pension plans is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future long term investment returns. For 2011, the return on plan assets assumption for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans was 8.0 percent. This assumption will be lowered to 7.5 percent for 2012. A change in the rate of return of 75 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would impact 2012 net periodic pension expense by approximately $22 million. As discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K, the Company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying values. Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows. Based on this testing, none of our goodwill or identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives was impaired as of December 31, 2011. As part of our ongoing financial reporting process, a collaborative effort is undertaken involving PPG managers with functional responsibility for financial, credit, environmental, legal, tax and benefit matters. The results of these efforts provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments on these contingencies and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements. We believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K related to these contingencies, pensions, other postretirement benefits, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate PPG management, although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates. 28 2011 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents Currency From December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011, the U.S. dollar strengthened against the currencies of most of the countries in which PPG operates, most notably against the Euro, the Brazilian real, and the Polish zloty. A $188 million decrease in PPG consolidated net assets and shareholders equity resulted from translating PPGs foreign denominated net assets to U.S. dollars at December 31, 2011, compared to December 31, 2010. However, during much of 2011, the U.S. dollar was weaker against the currencies of many countries in which PPG operates than it was in 2010, which had a favorable impact on 2011 pretax earnings of approximately $40 million from the translation of these foreign earnings into U.S. dollars. From December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010, the U.S. dollar strengthened against the Euro, the Polish zloty, and the British pound sterling while at the same time it weakened against the Canadian and Australian dollar, the Chinese yuan, the South Korean won, and the Brazilian real, which had a nearly offsetting effect on the translation of the net assets of PPGs operations denominated in non U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar. A $13 million decrease resulted from translating PPGs foreign denominated net assets at December 31, 2010, compared to December 31, 2009. The impact of translating foreign pretax earnings into U.S. dollars was insignificant. From December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009, the U.S. dollar weakened against the currencies of most of the countries in which PPG operated, most notably against the Euro, the Canadian dollar, the British pound sterling, the Polish zloty, the Brazilian real, the South Korean won and the Australian dollar. As a result, the effects of translating the net assets of PPGs operations denominated in non U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar increased consolidated net assets at December 31, 2009 by $173 million compared to December 31, 2008. During much of the year, the U.S. dollar was stronger against the currencies of many countries in which PPG operated than it was in 2008, which had an unfavorable impact on 2009 pretax earnings of $29 million from the translation of these foreign earnings into U.S. dollars. Forward Looking Statements The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. Managements Discussion and Analysis and other sections of this Annual Report contain forward looking statements that reflect the Companys current views with respect to future events and financial performance. You can identify forward looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to current or historic facts. Forward looking statements are identified by the use of the words aim, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, project, outlook, forecast and other expressions that indicate future events and trends. Any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by applicable law. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also, note the following cautionary statements. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the Companys forward looking statements. Such factors include global economic conditions, increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors, fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials, the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom, economic and political conditions in international markets, the ability to penetrate existing, developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates, fluctuations in tax rates, the impact of future legislation, the impact of environmental regulations, unexpected business disruptions and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation, including litigation that could result if the proposed asbestos settlement does not become effective. However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, while the list of factors presented here and under Item 1A is considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward looking statements. Consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forward looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties, other factors set forth in Item 1A of this Form 10 K and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 2011 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 29 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk PPG is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and natural gas prices and to changes in PPGs stock price. The Company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks. A detailed description of these exposures and the Companys risk management policies are provided in Note 11, Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Activities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The following disclosures summarize PPGs exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks. Quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible, unfavorable changes in market rates can impact PPGs consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2011 and 2010 were used to hedge PPGs exposure to foreign currency transaction risk. The fair value of these contracts as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 were liabilities of $1 million and assets of $2 million, respectively. The potential reduction in PPGs earnings resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10 percent for European currencies and 20 percent for Asian and South American currencies for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 would have been $23 million and $22 million, respectively. PPG entered into nine U.S. dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of $1.16 billion, of which $600 million were to settle on March 15, 2013 and $560 million were to settle on March 15, 2018. Another contract, with a notional amount of $140 million and a settlement date of March 15, 2018 was converted to cash during the first quarter of 2010. Accordingly, on settlement of the contracts, PPG will receive $1.16 billion and pay euros to the counterparties to the contracts. The Company has designated these swaps as hedges of its net investment in the acquired SigmaKalon businesses and, as a result, mark to fair value adjustments of the swaps have been and will be recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the aggregate fair value of these swaps was a liability of $120 million and $163 million, respectively. A 10 percent increase in the value of the euro to the U.S. dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts and increased the liability by $153 million and $158 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. PPG had non U.S. dollar denominated debt outstanding of $441 million as of December 31, 2011 and $447 million as of December 31, 2010. A weakening of the U.S. dollar by 10 percent against European currencies and by 20 percent against Asian and South American currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately $50 million and $52 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of PPGs interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010 the notional value of outstanding interest rate swaps totaled $445 million and $450 million, respectively. The fair value of the interest rate swaps was an asset of $26 million and $20 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The fair value of these swaps would have changed unfavorably by $1 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, if variable interest rates increased by 10 percent. A 10 percent increase in interest rates in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Europe and a 20 percent increase in interest rates in Asia and South America would have affected PPGs variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense approximately $1 million as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. Further, a 10 percent reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the Companys fixed rate debt by approximately $90 million and $115 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively; however, such changes would not have had an effect on PPGs annual earnings or cash flows. 30 2011 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K Table of Contents The Company entered into forward starting swaps in 2009 and in the second quarter of 2010 to effectively lock in a fixed interest rate for future debt refinancings with an anticipated term of ten years based on a the ten year swap rate, to which will be added a corporate spread. The notional amount of these swaps totaled $400 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The fair value of these swaps was a liability of $92 million as of December 31, 2011 and $21 million as of December 31, 2010. A 10 percent decline in interest rates would unfavorably affect the fair value of these swaps by $9 million and $14 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The fair value of natural gas swap contracts in place as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a liability of $9 million and $31 million, respectively. These contracts were entered into to reduce PPGs exposure to higher prices of natural gas. A 10 percent reduction in the price of natural gas would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these contracts by increasing the liability by $2 million and $5 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. An equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the Companys exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute PPG stock into an asbestos settlement trust (see Note 11 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Activities and Note 15, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, under Item 8 of this Form 10 K). The fair value of this instrument as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 was an asset of $56 million and $55 million, respectively. A 10 percent decrease in PPGs stock price would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of this instrument of $12 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 2011 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10 K 31 Table of Contents
