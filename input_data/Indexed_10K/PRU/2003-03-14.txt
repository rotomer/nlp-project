ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the Forward Looking Statements included on the Table of Contents, Selected Financial Data and the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The consolidated financial statements of Prudential Insurance for periods prior to the demutualization in December 2001 became the historical Consolidated Financial Statements of Prudential Financial. Overview Demutualization and Related Transactions On the date of demutualization, Prudential Insurance converted from a mutual life insurance company owned by its policyholders to a stock life insurance company and became an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial. On that date, eligible policyholders, as defined in the Plan of Reorganization, received shares of Prudential Financials Common Stock or the right to receive cash or policy credits, which are increases in policy values or increases in other policy benefits, upon the extinguishment of all membership interests in Prudential Insurance. On the date of demutualization, Prudential Financial completed an initial public offering of 126.5 million shares of its Common Stock at an initial public offering price of $27.50 per share, including 16.5 million shares issued as a result of the exercise of the over allotment option granted to underwriters in the initial public offering. Also on the date of demutualization, Prudential Financial completed the sale, through a private placement, of 2.0 million shares of Class B Stock, a separate class of common stock, at a price of $87.50 per share. The Common Stock reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the Class B Stock reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business, discussed below. Collectively, the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business are referred to as the Businesses. In addition, on the date of demutualization, Prudential Financial issued 13.8 million 6.75% equity security units for gross proceeds of $690 million, including as a component thereof redeemable capital securities of Prudential Financial Capital Trust I, a statutory business trust that is consolidated in our financial statements. Furthermore, Prudential Holdings, LLC (PHLLC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial that owns the capital stock of Prudential Insurance, issued $1.75 billion in senior secured notes (the IHC debt), a portion of which were insured by a bond insurer. Concurrent with the demutualization, various subsidiaries of Prudential Insurance were reorganized (or destacked) becoming direct or indirect subsidiaries of Prudential Financial. To effect the destacking, Prudential Insurance distributed to Prudential Financial, directly or indirectly, the following subsidiaries, together with certain related assets and liabilities: our property and casualty insurance companies; our principal securities brokerage companies; our international insurance companies; our principal asset management operations; and our international securities and investments, domestic banking, and residential real estate brokerage franchise and relocation services operations. The Plan of Reorganization required us to establish and operate a regulatory mechanism known as the Closed Block. The Closed Block is designed generally to provide for the reasonable expectations for future policy dividends after demutualization of holders of policies included in the Closed Block by allocating assets that will be used for payment of benefits, including policyholder dividends, on these policies. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Business for more information on the Closed Block. 72 Table of Contents Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Business 2002 Reorganization In August 2002, we implemented organizational changes within the Financial Services Businesses. The discussion below presents the results of our divisions and segments on a basis consistent with the new organization structure. The reclassifications associated with the realignment of our divisions and segments had no impact on total adjusted operating income (defined below under Consolidated Results of Operations) or net income of the Financial Services Businesses or Closed Block Business. Financial Services Businesses We refer to the businesses in our three operating divisions and our Corporate and Other operations, collectively, as our Financial Services Businesses. The Insurance division consists of our Individual Life and Annuities, Group Insurance and Property and Casualty Insurance segments. The Investment division consists of our Investment Management, Financial Advisory, Retirement and Other Asset Management segments. The International Insurance and Investments division consists of our International Insurance and International Investments segments. We also have Corporate and Other operations, which includes our real estate and relocation services business, as well as corporate items and initiatives that are not allocated to business segments. Corporate and Other operations also include businesses that we have divested or placed in wind down status. We attribute financing costs to each segment based on the amount of financing used by each segment. The net investment income of each segment includes earnings on the amount of equity that management believes is necessary to support the risks of that segment. We seek growth internally and through acquisition, joint ventures or other forms of business combination or investment. Our principal acquisition focus is in our current business lines, both domestic and international. Closed Block Business For periods prior to demutualization, the results of the Closed Block Business are those of our former Traditional Participating Products segment. Upon the establishment of the Closed Block Business, we transferred $5.6 billion of net assets previously associated with the former Traditional Participating Products segment to the Financial Services Businesses. This capital was initially allocated to our Corporate and Other operations. As a result, income from continuing operations before income taxes of the Closed Block Business for the year ended December 31, 2002 does not include returns on these net assets, which were historically included in income from continuing operations of the former Traditional Participating Products segment. In connection with the demutualization, we ceased offering domestic participating products. The liabilities for our individual in force participating products were segregated, together with assets which will be used exclusively for the payment of benefits and policyholder dividends, expenses and taxes with respect to these products, in a regulatory mechanism referred to as the Closed Block. We selected the amount and type of Closed Block assets and Closed Block liabilities included in the Closed Block so that the Closed Block assets initially had a lower book value than the Closed Block liabilities. We expect that the Closed Block assets will generate sufficient cash flow, together with anticipated revenues from the Closed Block policies, over the life of the Closed Block to fund payments of all expenses, taxes and policyholder benefits to be paid to, and the reasonable dividend expectations of, policyholders of the Closed Block policies. We also segregated for accounting purposes the assets that we need to hold outside the Closed Block to meet capital requirements related to the policies included within the Closed Block. No policies sold after demutualization will be added to the Closed Block, and its in force business is expected to ultimately decline as we pay policyholder benefits in full. We also expect the proportion of our business represented by the Closed Block to decline as we grow other businesses. A minor portion of our former Traditional Participating Products segment consisted of other traditional insurance products that were not included in the Closed Block. 73 Table of Contents The Closed Block Business consists principally of the Closed Block, assets held outside the Closed Block that Prudential Insurance needs to hold to meet capital requirements related to the Closed Block policies, invested assets held outside the Closed Block that represent the difference between the Closed Block assets and Closed Block liabilities and the interest maintenance reserve, deferred policy acquisition costs related to Closed Block policies, the principal amount of the IHC debt and related hedging activities and certain other related assets and liabilities. We allocated the net proceeds from the issuance of the Class B Stock and IHC debt, except for $72 million used to purchase a guaranteed investment contract to fund a portion of the bond insurance cost associated with that debt, to the Financial Services Businesses. However, we expect that the IHC debt will be serviced by the net cash flows of the Closed Block Business over time, and we report results of the Closed Block Business, including interest expenses associated with the IHC debt. Revenues and Expenses We earn our revenues principally from insurance premiums; mortality, expense, and asset management fees from insurance and investment products; commissions and other revenues from securities brokerage transactions; and investment of general account and other funds. We earn premiums primarily from the sale of individual life insurance, group life and disability insurance and automobile and homeowners insurance. We earn mortality, expense, and asset management fees from the sale and servicing of separate account products including variable life insurance and variable annuities. We also earn asset management and administrative fees from the sale, servicing and management of mutual funds, retirement products and other asset management products and services. Our operating expenses principally consist of insurance benefits provided, general business expenses, dividends to policyholders, commissions and other costs of selling and servicing the various products we sell and interest credited on general account liabilities. Profitability Our profitability depends principally on our ability to price and manage risk on insurance products, our ability to attract and retain customer assets, and our ability to manage expenses. Specific drivers of our profitability include: our ability to manufacture and distribute products and services and to introduce new products gaining market acceptance on a timely basis; our ability to price our insurance products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the cost of providing benefits and the expense of acquiring customers and administering those products; our mortality and morbidity experience on individual and group life insurance, annuity and group disability insurance products; our persistency experience, which affects our ability to recover the cost of acquiring new business over the lives of the contracts; our management of our exposure to catastrophic and other losses on our property and casualty insurance products; our cost of administering insurance contracts and providing asset management products and services; our returns on invested assets, net of the amounts we credit to policyholders accounts; our ability to earn commissions and fees from the sale and servicing of mutual funds, annuities, defined contribution and other investment products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the expense of providing such services; the amount of our assets under management and changes in their fair value, which affect the amount of asset management fees we receive; our ability to generate commissions and fees from securities activities at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the expenses of providing such services; and our ability to generate favorable investment results through asset liability management and strategic and tactical asset allocation. 74 Table of Contents In addition, factors such as regulation, competition, interest rates, taxes, foreign exchange rates, securities market conditions and general economic conditions affect our profitability. In some of our product lines, particularly those in the Closed Block Business, we share experience on mortality, morbidity, persistency and investment results with our customers, which can offset the impact of these factors on our profitability from those products. Historically, the participating products included in the Closed Block have yielded lower returns on capital invested than many of our other businesses. With the completion of the demutualization, we expect that the proportion of the traditional participating products in our in force business will gradually diminish as these older policies age, and we grow other businesses. However, the relatively lower returns to us on this existing block of business will continue to affect our consolidated results of operations for many years. Our Common Stock reflects the performance of our Financial Services Businesses, but there can be no assurance that the market value of the Common Stock will reflect solely the performance of these businesses. The Financial Services Businesses include the capital previously included in the former Traditional Participating Products segment in excess of the amount necessary to support the Closed Block Business. The Financial Services Businesses also includes other traditional insurance products previously included in the former Traditional Participating Products segment but which are not included in the Closed Block. The Class B Stock reflects the financial performance of our Closed Block Business. Application of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. Management, on an ongoing basis, reviews estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements. If management determines that modifications in assumptions and estimates are appropriate given current facts and circumstances, results of operations and financial position as reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements may change significantly. The following sections discuss the accounting policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. Valuation of Investments A large portion of our investments is reflected at fair value in the statements of financial position based on quoted market prices or estimates from independent pricing services. However, when such information is not available, for example, with respect to private placement fixed maturity securities, which comprise 18% of our investments as of December 31, 2002, fair value is estimated, typically by using a discounted cash flow model, which considers current market credit spreads for publicly traded issues with similar terms by companies of comparable credit quality. Consequently, changes in estimated future cash flows or in our assessment of the issuers credit quality will result in changes in fair value estimates. For fixed maturities and equity securities classified as available for sale, the impact of such changes is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of equity. However, the carrying value of these securities is reduced, with a corresponding charge to earnings, when a decline in value is considered to be other than temporary. Factors we consider in determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary include: whether the decline is substantial; the length of time the fair value has been less than cost, generally six months; and the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer. This corresponding charge is referred to as an impairment and is reflected in Realized investment gains (losses), net in the statements of operations. The level of impairment losses can be expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and decrease when economic conditions improve. Commercial loans, which comprise 11% of our investments as of December 31, 2002, are carried at unpaid principal balances, net of unamortized discounts and an allowance for losses. This allowance includes a loan specific portion as well as a portfolio reserve for incurred but not specifically identified losses. The loan specific portion is based on managements judgment as to ultimate collectibility of loan principal. The portfolio reserve is based on a number of factors, such as historical experience and portfolio diversification. Similar to impairment losses discussed above, the allowance for losses can be expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and decrease when economic conditions improve. 75 Table of Contents See Business General Account Investments for a discussion of our investment portfolio and related results, including policies and disclosures regarding other than temporary declines in investment value. Policyholder Liabilities and Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs The liability for Future policy benefits is the largest liability included in our statements of financial position, 33% of total liabilities as of December 31, 2002. Changes in this liability are generally reflected in the Policyholders benefits caption in our statements of operations. This liability is primarily comprised of the present value of estimated future payments to holders of life insurance and annuity products where the timing and amount of payment depends on policyholder mortality, surrender or retirement experience. For traditional participating life insurance products of our Closed Block Business, the mortality and interest rate assumptions we apply are those used to calculate the policies guaranteed cash surrender values. For life insurance and annuity products of our Financial Services Businesses, expected mortality is generally based on the Companys historical experience or standard industry tables. Interest rate assumptions are based on factors such as market conditions and expected investment returns. Although mortality and interest rate assumptions are locked in upon the issuance of new insurance or annuity business with fixed and guaranteed terms, significant changes in experience or assumptions may require us to provide for expected future losses on a product by establishing premium deficiency reserves. For example, in 2000 we restructured the portfolio that supports the structured settlement products within our Retirement segment to reduce the emphasis on equity investments, which in turn lowered our expected future investment returns. As a result, we recorded a charge to establish a premium deficiency reserve for these products. Our liability for Unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, which is 1% of total liabilities as of December 31, 2002, includes estimates of claims that we believe have been incurred, but have not yet been reported (IBNR) as of the balance sheet date, primarily attributable to our Property and Casualty Insurance segment and our Group Insurance segment. Consistent with industry accounting practice, we do not establish loss reserves until a loss, including a loss from catastrophe, has occurred. These IBNR estimates, and estimates of the amounts of loss we will ultimately incur on reported claims, which are based in part on our historical experience, are regularly adjusted to reflect actual claims experience. When actual experience differs from our previous estimate, the resulting difference will be included in our reported results for the period of the change in estimate in the Policyholders benefits caption in our statements of operations. On an ongoing basis, trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of claim reserve levels. In recent years, actual claims experience with respect to our automobile insurance business within our Property and Casualty Insurance segment has been more favorable than the assumptions we used in originally establishing the reserves for these claims, which resulted in a benefit to earnings for these years due to reserve releases. Actual claims experience can also be less favorable than that assumed in establishing reserves, which can require a charge to earnings to increase reserves. For most life insurance and annuity products that we sell, we defer costs that vary with and are related primarily to the production of new business to the extent these costs are deemed recoverable from future profits, and we record these costs as an asset known as Deferred policy acquisition costs or DAC in the statements of financial position. We amortize this DAC asset over the expected lives of the contracts, based on the level and timing of either estimated profits or premiums, depending on the type of contract. For products with amortization based on estimated profits, the amortization rate is periodically updated to reflect current period experience or changes in assumptions that affect future profitability, such as lapse rates, investment returns, mortality experience, expense margins and surrender charges. However, for products with amortization based on future premiums, the amortization rate is locked in when the product is sold. For example, expected profitability is a significant estimate in evaluating deferred acquisition costs related to annuity products. Expected profitability considers, among other assumptions, our best estimate of future asset returns to estimate the future fees we expect to earn, the costs associated with minimum death benefit guarantees we expect to incur and other profitability factors. For the average remaining life of our variable annuity contracts in force as of December 31, 2002, our evaluation of deferred policy acquisition costs is based on a 9.25% annual blended rate of return that reflects an assumed rate of return of 11.5% for equity type assets. Continuation of current market conditions or further deterioration in market conditions may result in increases in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, while a significant improvement in market conditions may result in a 76 Table of Contents decrease in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs. These changes in DAC balances are included as a component of General and administrative expenses in our statements of operations. See Insurance Division Individual Life and Annuities for discussion of the impact of DAC amortization on our results of our annuities businesses, including increased amortization recorded in 2002 and 2001 reflecting lower estimates of future gross profits as well as a discussion of the proposed AICPA Statement of Position, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts. Reserves For Contingencies A contingency is an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved upon the occurrence of future events. Under GAAP, reserves for contingencies are required to be established when the future event is probable and its impact can be reasonably estimated. An example is the establishment of a reserve for losses in connection with an unresolved legal matter. The initial reserve reflects managements best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and, ultimately, when the matter is brought to closure. Other Significant Estimates In addition to the items discussed above, the application of GAAP requires management to make other estimates and assumptions. For example, accounting for pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefits requires estimates of future returns on plan assets, expected increases in compensation levels and trends in health care costs. See Corporate and Other Operations for a discussion of our pension assumptions and related returns. Another example is the recognition of deferred tax assets, which depends on managements assumption that future earnings will be sufficient to realize the deferred benefit. This is discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounting Policies Adopted Accounting for Stock Options Employee stock options issued during 2001 and 2002 are accounted for using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, Accounting to Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations, an allowable alternative method under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. Under APB No. 25, we did not recognize any stock based compensation expense for employee stock options as all employee stock options had an exercise price equal to the market value of our Common Stock at the date of grant. After consideration, we have concluded that our employee stock options represent compensation costs and including such costs in our results of operations is a preferable method of accounting. Effective January 1, 2003, we changed our accounting for employee stock options to adopt the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, as amended, prospectively for all new awards granted to employees on or after January 1, 2003. Under these provisions, the fair value of all employee stock options awarded on or after January 1, 2003, will be included in the determination of net income, but not options awarded prior thereto. Accordingly, the amount we will include in the determination of net income will be less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value method had been applied to all awards since inception of the employee stock option plan. The fair value of employee stock options is determined using a Black Scholes option pricing model that utilizes the following assumptions: dividend yield, expected volatility, risk free interest rate, and expected life of the option. If we had accounted for all employee stock options under the fair value based accounting method, net income for the year ended December 31, 2002 would have been reduced by $30 million and basic and diluted earnings per share for Common Stock would have reduced by $.05. For the period December 18, 2001 through December 31, 2001, net income and basic and diluted earnings per share of Common Stock would have been reduced by $1 million and $.01, respectively. 77 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations During 2002, we announced the discontinuance of our web based business for the workplace distribution of voluntary benefits, our European retail transaction oriented stockbrokerage and related activities and our Tokyo based retail brokerage business. The discontinuance of these businesses was accounted for under SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. Under SFAS No. 144, in the period in which such components qualify for discontinued operations treatment, the results of operations for each component for all periods presented are reclassified to Income (loss) from discontinued operations, a separate line in the statements of operations. In addition, where necessary, we reduced the carrying value of each component to estimated fair value through a charge to earnings that is also included in Income (loss) from discontinued operations. Goodwill As of December 31, 2002, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Impairment testing requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill, and record an impairment charge if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. As a result of the December 31, 2002 annual impairment test, we determined that the goodwill related to our Property and Casualty Insurance segment was impaired. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of $33 million representing the entire carrying amount of the segments goodwill. The Property and Casualty Insurance segment has been determined to be a reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing. The fair value of the segment was determined based on independent third party assessments. We initially adopted SFAS No. 142 as of January 1, 2002. Accordingly, results for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 include goodwill amortization of $21 million and $13 million, respectively, while no goodwill amortization was recorded for 2002. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is currently discussing the accounting related to certain modified coinsurance (modco) and funds withheld reinsurance agreements. More specifically, the discussions relate to whether modco and funds withheld reinsurance agreements that provide for a total return on a pool of fixed income securities contain embedded derivatives that would require bifurcation under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The FASB plans to address this issue by combining it with a portion of the tentative guidance in SFAS No. 133 Implementation Issue No. B36, Embedded Derivatives Bifurcation Of Embedded Credit. If embedded derivative accounting for certain modco and funds withheld reinsurance agreements is eventually required under Implementation Issue No. B36, we intend to apply the guidance prospectively, for all existing contracts and future transactions, in the quarter following final resolution of the Issue. Based upon our current level of modco and funds withheld reinsurance, we do not believe application of Implementation Issue No. B36, as we currently understand it, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Consolidated Results of Operations In managing our business, we analyze operating performance separately for our Financial Services Businesses and our Closed Block Business. For the Financial Services Businesses, we analyze our operating performance using a non GAAP measure we call adjusted operating income. Results of the Closed Block Business for all periods are evaluated and presented only in accordance with GAAP. We calculate adjusted operating income for the Financial Services Businesses by adjusting our income from continuing operations before income taxes to exclude the following items: realized investment gains, net of losses and related charges and adjustments; 78 Table of Contents sales practices remedies and costs; the contribution to income/loss of divested businesses that we sold or exited that did not qualify for discontinued operations accounting treatment under GAAP; and demutualization costs and expenses. Wind down businesses that we have not divested remain in adjusted operating income. The excluded items are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. You should not view adjusted operating income as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with GAAP, and you should note that our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies. However, we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our businesses. We exclude realized investment gains, net of losses including impairments and sales of credit impaired securities and related charges and adjustments. The timing of impairments and losses from sales of credit impaired securities is largely dependent on market credit cycles and can vary considerably across periods. In addition, the timing of other sales that would result in gains or losses is subject to our discretion. Including the fluctuating effects of these transactions could distort trends in the underlying profitability of our businesses. We exclude sales practices remedies and costs relating to the settlement of individual life insurance sales practices issues for the period from 1982 through 1995 because they relate to a substantial and identifiable non recurring event. We exclude contribution to income/loss of businesses we divested because, as a result of our decision to dispose of these businesses, these results are not relevant to the profitability of our ongoing operations and could distort the trends associated with our ongoing operations. We also exclude demutualization costs and expenses because they are directly related to our demutualization and could distort the trends associated with our business operations. The tables below summarize certain financial data, including year over year variances, for the Financial Services Businesses on both a GAAP and adjusted operating income basis, as well as the results of the Closed Block Business on a GAAP basis. Following these tables, you will find a detailed discussion of Financial Services Businesses results of operations by segment, as well as results of operations of the Closed Block Business.

(5) See Demutualization Costs and Expenses for a discussion of our demutualization costs and expenses. Realized Investment Gains Realized investment gains, net of losses, primarily include gains and losses resulting from sales and impairments of fixed income and equity investments, prepayment premiums we receive on private bond issues, and gains and losses in connection with derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. We perform impairment reviews on an ongoing basis. The level of impairments generally reflects economic conditions, and is expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and to decrease when economic conditions improve. We may realize additional credit related losses through sales of investments pursuant to our credit risk and portfolio management objectives. We require most issuers of private fixed maturity securities to pay us make whole yield maintenance payments when they prepay the securities. The prepayments are driven by factors specific to the activities of our borrowers as much as by the interest rate environment. We use derivative contracts to hedge the risk that changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates will affect the market value of certain investments. We also use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk that 80 Table of Contents unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates will reduce U.S. dollar equivalent earnings generated by certain of our non U.S. businesses. The vast majority of these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, and consequently we recognize the changes in fair value of such contracts from period to period in current earnings, although we do not necessarily account for the hedged assets or liabilities the same way. Accordingly, realized investment gains and losses from our hedging activities contribute significantly to fluctuations in net income. The comparisons below discuss realized investment gains, net of losses and related charges and adjustments. Related charges, which pertain to the Financial Services Businesses and not to the Closed Block Business, pertain to policyholder dividends, deferred policy acquisition costs and reserves for future policy benefits. A percentage of net realized investment gains on specified Gibraltar Life assets is required to be paid as dividends to Gibraltar Life policyholders. See Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Division and Closed Block Business below. We amortize deferred policy acquisition costs for interest sensitive products based on estimated gross profits, which include net realized investment gains on the underlying invested assets, and the related charge for amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs represents the amortization related to net realized investment gains. We adjust the reserves for some of our policies when cash flows related to these policies are affected by net realized investment gains, and the related charge for reserves for future policy benefits represents that adjustment. The changes in these related charges from one period to another may be disproportionate to the changes in realized investment gains, net of losses, evaluated over several periods. A portion of realized gains, pertaining to certain derivative results, are included in adjusted operating income. Pursuant to a currency hedging program, we execute forward sale contracts in the hedged currencies in exchange for U.S. dollars at a specified exchange rate. The maturities of these contracts correspond with future periods in which non U.S. earnings are expected to be generated. These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under GAAP. All resulting profits or losses from such contracts, including mark to market adjustments of open contracts, are included in Realized investment gains (losses), net. When the contracts are terminated in the same period that the expected earnings emerge, the resulting positive or negative cash flow is included in adjusted operating income. In addition, we utilize interest and currency swaps to manage interest and currency exchange rate exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities, including duration mismatches. For the swap contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, mark to market adjustments of open contracts as well as periodic settlements are included in Realized investment gains (losses), net. Periodic settlements pertaining to such contracts are included in adjusted operating income. Investment Results The following tables set forth net realized investment gains (losses), and related charges and adjustments for the Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Business, and by investment type for each business, for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. As discussed above, related charges pertain only to the Financial Services Businesses.

Consolidated realized investment losses, net of gains and related charges and adjustments, were $1,446 million for 2002, compared to $679 million for 2001. The Financial Services Businesses net realized investment losses for 2002, before related charges and adjustments, were $771 million compared to $128 million for 2001. Realized losses from impairments and credit related sales were $1,055 million for 2002 and $785 million for 2001. These losses were offset in part, in both periods, by realized gains driven largely by sales of fixed income securities in declining rate environments and gains from prepayments of private bonds. Realized losses for 2002 include derivative losses of $226 million, compared to derivative gains of $236 million for 2001. These amounts include $94 million and $34 million of realized investment gains for 2002 and 2001, respectively, that are included as part of adjusted operating income. The remaining derivative losses in 2002 were primarily the result of losses of $152 million on treasury futures contracts used to manage the duration of the Companys fixed maturity investment portfolio. In addition, there were losses of $88 million on foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge the future income of non U.S. businesses, driven by the weakening of the U.S. dollar. Derivative gains recorded for 2001 were primarily attributable to the impact of the strengthening dollar on currency hedges of non U.S. dollar investments, as well as gains on Japanese equity futures contracts held in anticipation of sales of equity securities. For the Closed Block Business, net realized investment losses for 2002 were $587 million compared to $543 million for 2001. Net losses on derivatives were $174 million for 2002 compared to $10 million for 2001. Derivative losses for 2002 were largely attributable to losses on equity futures contracts and currency hedges of non U.S. dollar investments. Realized losses from non derivative activity were $413 million for 2002 compared to $533 million for 2001. Realized losses in 2002 include impairments and credit related losses aggregating $896 million, which were offset in part by realized gains on sales of fixed income securities and prepayment premiums. Realized losses in 2001 included $659 million of impairments and credit related losses, which were offset in part by realized gains on sales of fixed income securities and prepayment premiums. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Consolidated realized investment losses, net of gains and related charges and adjustments, were $679 million in 2001, compared to $317 million in 2000. The Financial Services Businesses net realized investment losses for 2001, before related charges and adjustments, were $128 million compared to $357 million for 2000. Realized losses from impairments and credit 82 Table of Contents related sales were $785 million for 2001 and $542 million for 2000. Realized losses in 2001 were offset in part by realized gains from sales of fixed income securities in a declining rate environment and from prepayment gains on private bonds. Realized losses in 2000 were offset in part by realized gains from sales of equities during more favorable equity market conditions in connection with a portfolio rebalancing program. Realized gains from derivatives were $236 million for 2001, compared to gains of $70 million for 2000. These amounts include $34 million and $22 million of realized investment gains for 2001 and 2000, respectively, that are included as part of adjusted operating income. Derivative gains recorded for 2001 were primarily attributable to the impact of the strengthening dollar on currency hedges of non U.S. dollar investments, as well as gains on Japanese equity futures contracts held in anticipation of sales of equity securities. For the Closed Block Business, net realized investment losses for 2001 were $543 million compared to realized investment gains of $91 million for 2000. Net losses on derivatives were $10 million for 2001 compared to gains of $117 million for 2000. Derivative gains in 2000 were largely attributable to gains on treasury futures contracts used to manage the duration of the fixed maturity investment portfolio. Realized losses from non derivative activity were $533 million for 2001 compared to $26 million for 2000. Realized losses in 2001 included $659 million of impairments and credit related losses, which were offset in part by realized gains on sales of fixed income securities and prepayment premiums. Realized losses in 2000 include impairments and credit related losses aggregating $454 million, offset by net realized gains from sales of equities during more favorable equity market conditions in connection with a portfolio rebalancing program, and from gains in joint venture real estate sales. Sales Practices Remedies and Costs Our income from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2002 includes a pre tax charge of $20 million of additional sales practices costs including related administrative costs, litigation costs and settlements. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the insurance sales practices litigation. Divested Businesses Our income from continuing operations before income taxes includes results from several businesses that we have divested but did not qualify for discontinued operations treatment in our income statement under GAAP. Results of divested businesses reflect losses of $80 million, $147 million and $636 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Our results from divested businesses for 2002 primarily relate to Gibraltar Casualty Company, a commercial property and casualty insurer that we sold in September 2000, to Everest Re Group, Ltd. (Everest). Pursuant to the sale we entered into a stop loss reinsurance agreement whereby if and when aggregate post sale claim and claim related payments exceed Gibraltar Casualtys reserves recorded at the time of sale, we will pay Everest for 80% of the first $200 million of such excess. Through December 31, 2002 Everest had recorded reserve additions of $99 million. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded a liability of $79 million representing our 80% share of such development, generally related to asbestos and environmental exposures. The losses from divested business for 2001 and 2000 relate primarily to the former lead managed equity underwriting for corporate issuers and institutional fixed income businesses of Prudential Securities, which recorded pre tax losses of $159 million in 2001 and $620 million in 2000. The loss in 2001 came primarily from deterioration in the value of collateralized receivables, which we are in the process of liquidating, coupled with wind down costs, while the losses from these operations in 2000 came primarily from charges of $476 million associated with our termination and wind down of these activities. The remainder of our divested businesses are attributable to our remaining obligations with respect to our divested residential mortgage banking business, a benefits plan administrator we sold in 1998, and a Canadian life insurance company that we sold in May 2000. Demutualization Costs and Expenses We incurred costs and expenses related to demutualization totaling $588 million and $143 million in the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Demutualization costs in 2001 included $340 million of demutualization consideration paid to our former Canadian branch policyholders. Demutualization costs and 83 Table of Contents expenses are reported separately in our consolidated income statements within income from continuing operations before income taxes. Demutualization expenses consisted primarily of the costs of engaging independent accounting, actuarial, investment banking, legal and other consultants that advised us and insurance regulators in the demutualization process and related matters as well as printing and postage for communication with policyholders. Taxes Shown below is our income tax provision (benefit) for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, separately reflecting the impact of certain significant items. Also presented below is the income tax provision (benefit) that would have resulted from application of the statutory 35% federal income tax rate in each of these periods. For the Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (in millions) Tax provision (benefit) $ (192 ) $ (34 ) $ 398 Impact of: Favorable tax resolution pertaining to 1995 disposition 183 Adjustments to mutual life insurance company tax estimated liability 200 (100 ) Tax provision (benefit) excluding these items $ (9 ) $ 166 $ 298 Tax provision (benefit) at statutory rate $ 23 $ (49 ) $ 253 For the year ended December 31, 2001, the difference between taxes recorded excluding the items shown above and taxes that would have resulted from the application of the statutory rate is attributable, in part, to the inclusion of non deductible demutualization costs and expenses in income from continuing operations. Discontinued Operations In the fourth quarter of 2002, we announced our decision to exit certain of the international securities operations of Prudential Securities Group Inc. in Europe. The exited operations include the European retail transaction oriented stockbrokerage and related activities. Upon exiting these activities, the primary business of Prudential Securities Group Inc. in Europe is the provision of private banking and wealth management services to high net worth individuals. Institutional services in Europe are limited primarily to the sale of U.S. equities. The loss for the discontinued businesses for the year ended December 31, 2002 includes a pre tax charge of $43 million relating primarily to severance and termination benefits, and office closure costs. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2002, we decided to sell our retail broker dealer operations in Tokyo and have included such in discontinued operations. In the third quarter of 2002, we discontinued our web based business for the workplace distribution of voluntary benefits. Results of this business, previously reflected in the results of Corporate and Other operations and now reflected as discontinued operations, were losses of $37 million, net of tax, and $13 million, net of tax, for 2002 and 2001, respectively. For 2002, these amounts include an impairment charge of $32 million on our investment in a vendor of that distribution platform, as well as a charge of $7 million related to severance and contract termination costs. The foregoing amounts are before related income taxes. Results for discontinued operations also include a reduction in reserves pertaining to our discontinued healthcare business, primarily in connection with the favorable resolution of certain legal and regulatory matters, of $45 million, $16 million and $77 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our retained obligations for litigation pertaining to this business. 84 Table of Contents Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Division and Closed Block Business The following tables summarize certain financial data for each of our three divisions and for Corporate and Other operations, which together comprise our Financial Services Businesses, and our Closed Block Business.

In the fourth quarter of 2002, we entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire Skandia U.S. Inc. Skandia is the largest distributor of variable annuities through independent financial planners in the U.S. We expect this acquisition to close in the second quarter of 2003. This transaction is subject to various closing conditions, including, among others, regulatory approvals, filings under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and approval by the boards of directors and shareholders of the mutual funds advised by Skandia U.S. subsidiaries. Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Income from continuing operations before income taxes declined $41 million, or 14%, from $284 million in 2001 to $243 million in 2002. The decline reflects an increase in realized investment losses, net, and related charges of $51 million, to losses of $147 million in 2002. For a discussion of 87 Table of Contents realized investment losses, net, and related charges see Consolidated Results of Operations Realized Investment Gains. Partially offsetting this was an increase in adjusted operating income of $10 million, to $390 million in 2002, as discussed below. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased $35 million, or 14%, from $249 million in 2000 to $284 million in 2001. The increase reflects an increase in realized investment losses, net, and related charges of $84 million, to losses of $96 million in 2001. This increase was more than offset by an increase in adjusted operating income of $119 million, to $380 million in 2001, as discussed below. Adjusted Operating Income 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Adjusted operating income increased $10 million in 2002 from 2001. The increase reflected a $159 million increase from individual life insurance and a $149 million decrease from individual annuities. The segments individual life insurance business reported adjusted operating income of $432 million in 2002, compared to $273 million in the prior year, which included $25 million of net losses from insurance claims arising out of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the U.S. Results for 2002 benefited from a decline in operating expenses, reflecting savings that we continue to realize from our field management and agency restructuring program implemented in 2001, for which that years expenses included $90 million of implementation costs. Additionally, results of our individual life insurance business for 2002 benefited from increased investment income, primarily from an increase in the level of invested assets. However, these items were partially offset by less favorable mortality experience in 2002, as well as a $47 million increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, primarily due to a market decline and related policy lapses associated with declines in variable life insurance account values. The segments individual annuity business reported a loss, on an adjusted operating income basis, of $42 million in 2002 compared to adjusted operating income of $107 million in 2001. Results of our annuity business in 2002 included charges totaling $137 million for additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs. These charges reflect our lower estimates of future gross profits resulting from greater expected costs from minimum death benefit guarantees and lower expected fees under these contracts due to declines in asset values and decreased future asset returns. Results for 2001 included similar charges for additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs totaling $30 million. A decline in fee revenues from our variable annuity products due to a decrease in average account values was partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses resulting from our expense management efforts. Deferred acquisition costs related to annuity products are evaluated quarterly by comparing our actual profitability to our expectations. Expected profitability considers, among other assumptions, our estimate of future asset returns which determine the future fees we will earn, the costs associated with minimum death benefit guarantees we expect to incur and other profitability factors. If actual asset returns do not differ significantly from our expectations, they do not result in a change in the rate of amortization of deferred acquisition costs. Where actual asset returns differ significantly from expectations, future asset return assumptions are evaluated using a reversion to mean approach. Under the reversion to mean approach, we consider historical returns over a period of time and project returns for a future four year period so that the investments underlying the annuities grow at a targeted return for the entire period. We evaluate returns over a historical period beginning January 1, 2000 giving higher weighting to the returns experienced during the most recent two year period. A calculated rate of return over the four future years, which we refer to as the look forward period, is determined so that this calculated rate, together with the actual rate of return for the historical period, produces the targeted return for the entire period. If the calculated rate of return is consistent with our range of expectations in light of market conditions, we use it to project the asset growth for the next four years. If the calculated rate of return is not supported by our current expectations, we adjust the rate of return for purposes of these computations. For contract years after the look forward period, we project asset growth using our long term rate, currently an 8% annual blended rate of return, which reflects an assumed rate of return of 8.85% for equity type assets. Beginning in the second quarter and continuing throughout the year, we utilized a rate of return lower than the calculated return, which contributed to our additional amortization of deferred acquisition 88 Table of Contents costs during the second and third quarters of 2002. The equity rate of return used in the immediate four year look forward period varies by product, but was under 15% for all of our variable annuity products for our evaluation of deferred policy acquisition costs as of December 31, 2002. For the average remaining life of our variable annuity contracts in force as of December 31, 2002, our evaluation of deferred policy acquisition costs is based on a 9.25% annual blended rate of return that reflects an assumed rate of return of 11.5% for equity type assets. Continuation of current market conditions or additional deterioration in market conditions may result in further increases in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, while a significant improvement in market conditions may result in a decrease in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Adjusted operating income increased $119 million in 2001 from 2000. The increase reflected a $159 million increase from individual life insurance and a $40 million decrease from individual annuities. The segments individual life insurance business reported adjusted operating income of $273 million in 2001, compared to $114 million in the prior year. The increase came primarily from a $183 million decrease in operating expenses primarily from savings that we began to realize from our field management and agency restructuring program and lower program implementation costs, which amounted to $90 million in 2001 and $107 million in 2000. Additionally, in 2000 we recorded a $23 million one time increase in reserves related to a portion of our variable life insurance business in force. However, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased $60 million in 2001 from 2000, and we recorded net losses of $25 million from insurance claims arising from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the U.S. The segments individual annuity business reported adjusted operating income of $107 million in 2001, compared to $147 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income for 2000 benefited $21 million from refinements in our calculations of deferred policy acquisition costs. Excluding this change, adjusted operating income of our individual annuity business decreased $19 million, or 15%, primarily due to lower fee revenues. Revenues 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Revenues, as shown in the table above under Operating Results, decreased $16 million, or 1%, from 2001 to 2002. The decrease reflects a $60 million decrease from individual annuities, partially offset by a $44 million increase from individual life insurance. The segments individual life insurance business reported revenues of $1.963 billion in 2002, compared to $1.919 billion in 2001. Net investment income increased $27 million, or 7%, from $391 million in 2001 to $418 million in 2002, primarily from an increase in the level of invested assets. Commissions and other income increased $12 million, from $124 million in 2001 to $136 million in 2002, primarily due to an increased level of reinsurance activity. Premiums amounted to $395 million in 2002, essentially unchanged from the prior year. Revenues from our individual annuity business declined $60 million, from $801 million in 2001 to $741 million in 2002. Policy charges and fees and asset management fees decreased $48 million from $315 million in 2001 to $267 million in 2002, driven primarily from our variable annuity products, reflecting a decline in the average market value of customer accounts on which our fees are based. Net investment income declined $25 million, from $440 million in 2001 to $415 million in 2002, primarily due to lower yields on our investment portfolio. These declines were partially offset by higher premiums resulting from increased sales of our immediate income annuity product. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Revenues decreased $21 million, or 1%, in 2001 from 2000. The decrease reflects a $112 million decline from individual annuities, partially offset by an increase in revenues of $91 million from individual life insurance. The segments individual life insurance business reported revenues of $1.919 billion in 2001, an increase of $91 million, or 5%, from 2000. Premiums increased $117 million, or 43%, from $270 million in 2000 to $387 million in 2001, reflecting increased premiums on term insurance we issued, under policy provisions, to customers who previously had lapsing variable life insurance with us. Policy charges and fees amounted to 89 Table of Contents $1.017 billion in 2001, essentially unchanged from $1.023 billion in 2000. Net investment income increased $17 million, from $374 million in 2000 to $391 million in 2001, primarily from an increase in the base of general account invested assets. Commissions and other income decreased $37 million, from $161 million in 2000 to $124 million in 2001, primarily as a result of a decline in sales of non Prudential products by our agents. Revenues from our individual annuity business declined $112 million, from $913 million in 2000 to $801 million in 2001. Policy charges and fees and asset management fees decreased $55 million, from $370 million in 2000 to $315 million in 2001, primarily from our variable annuity products reflecting a decline in the average market value of customer accounts on which our fees are based. Net investment income declined $31 million, from $471 million in 2000 to $440 million in 2001, primarily due to lower yields on our investment portfolio. Premiums declined $26 million, from $72 million in 2000 to $46 million in 2001, primarily due to a decline in premiums we recognized on conversion by customers of deferred annuities to income paying status. Benefits and Expenses 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under Operating Results, decreased $26 million, or 1%, from 2001 to 2002. The decrease reflects a decrease of $115 million from individual life insurance and an $89 million increase from individual annuities. Benefits and expenses of our individual life insurance business decreased $115 million, or 7%, from $1.646 billion in 2001 to $1.531 billion in 2002. Operating expenses, including distribution costs that we charge to expense, decreased $159 million, from $578 million in 2001 to $419 million in 2002, reflecting savings from our program to restructure our field management and agency structure, for which expenses in 2001 included $90 million of implementation costs. Policyholder benefits and related changes in reserves decreased $12 million, from $688 million in 2001 to $676 million in 2002, as the impact of claims arising from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the U.S. on 2001 benefits and expenses was partially offset by less favorable mortality experience in 2002 than that of 2001, other than the impact of those claims. A $47 million increase in amortization of deferred acquisition costs, primarily due to the market impact of declines in variable life insurance account values, was a partial offset to the aforementioned decreases in benefits and expenses. The segments individual annuity business reported benefits and expenses of $783 million in 2002, compared to $694 million in 2001, an increase of $89 million, or 13%. The increase reflects an increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs of $87 million, which primarily includes charges for additional amortization of $137 million in 2002 and $30 million in 2001 resulting from decreases in expected future gross profits on our annuity products as discussed above. Guaranteed minimum death benefit payments increased $23 million, from $14 million in 2001 to $37 million in 2002. The guaranteed minimum death benefit feature provides annuity contract holders with a guarantee that the benefit received at death will be no less than a prescribed minimum amount. This minimum amount is based on the net deposits paid into the contract, the net deposits accumulated at a specified rate, the highest historical account value on a contract anniversary, or more typically, the greatest of these values, depending on features offered in various contracts and elected by the contract holders. These contracts generally require payment of additional charges for guarantees other than those based on net deposits paid into the contract. To the extent that the guaranteed minimum death benefit is higher than the current account value at the time of death, we incur a cost. This results in increased annuity policy benefits in periods of declining financial markets and in periods of stable financial markets following a decline. Current accounting literature does not prescribe advance recognition of the expected future net costs associated with these guarantees, and accordingly, we currently do not record a liability corresponding to these projected future obligations for death benefits in excess of annuity account values. However, we consider the expected net costs associated with these guarantees in our calculations of expected gross profits on variable annuity business, on which our periodic evaluations of unamortized deferred policy acquisition costs are based. A proposed AICPA Statement of Position, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts (the Proposed SOP), would require the recording of a liability for the expected net costs associated with these guarantees under certain circumstances, if adopted as proposed. We are currently evaluating the impact of the Proposed SOP. As of December 31, 2002, the death benefit coverage in force (representing the amount that we would have to pay if all annuitants had died on that date) was approximately $3.4 billion. The death benefit coverage in force represents the excess of the guaranteed benefit amount over the fair value of the underlying mutual fund investments. Partially offsetting the increase in 90 Table of Contents amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs was lower asset management expense on our variable annuity products and a decrease in general and administrative expenses reflecting our cost management efforts. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Benefits and expenses decreased $140 million, or 6%, from 2000 to 2001. The decline reflects decreases of $72 million from individual annuities and $68 million from our individual life insurance business. Benefits and expenses of our individual life insurance business decreased $68 million, or 4%, from $1.714 billion in 2000 to $1.646 billion in 2001. Operating expenses, including distribution costs that we charge to expense, decreased $183 million, from $761 million in 2000 to $578 million in 2001, primarily as a result of savings we began to realize from our program to restructure our field management and agency structure and lower program implementation costs which amounted to $90 million in 2001 and $107 million in 2000. Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased $60 million, from $172 million in 2000 to $232 million in 2001, primarily due to declines in market values of the underlying assets on which our fees are based. Policyholder benefits and related changes in reserves increased $60 million, from $628 million in 2000 to $688 million in 2001, primarily as a result of term insurance we issued under policy provisions to customers who previously had lapsing variable life insurance with us and insurance claims arising from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the U.S. In 2000, policyholder benefits and the related changes in reserves included a reserve increase related to a portion of our variable life insurance business as noted above amounting to $23 million. Benefits and expenses of our individual annuity business decreased $72 million, from $766 million in 2000 to $694 million 2001. Benefits and expenses for 2000 include a $21 million reduction in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs from the refinements noted above. Excluding the impact of this change, benefits and expenses decreased $93 million, or 12%, reflecting a decrease in general and administrative expenses due to our expense management efforts. In addition, policyholder benefits and related changes in reserves decreased $43 million, from $152 million in 2000 to $109 million in 2001, primarily as a result of the $26 million reduction in premiums noted above and a $12 million charge we recorded in 2000 to increase annuity reserves due to investment portfolio restructuring to reduce the emphasis on equity investments. Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, excluding the refinements noted above, decreased $20 million, primarily as a result of decreased amortization associated with lower fee income. Sales Results and Account Values The following table sets forth the individual life insurance business sales, as measured by statutory first year premiums and deposits, and changes in account value for annuities business, for the periods indicated. Sales of the individual life insurance business do not correspond to revenues under GAAP; they are, however, a relevant measure of business activity. In managing our individual life insurance business, we analyze statutory first year premiums and deposits as well as revenues because statutory first year premiums and deposits measure the current sales performance of the business, while revenues reflect, predominantly in our case, the renewal persistency and aging of in force policies written in prior years and net investment income, as well as current sales. For our individual annuity business, assets are reported at account value and net sales (redemptions) are gross sales minus redemptions or surrenders and withdrawals, as applicable.

(5) Includes maintenance and insurance charges assessed, net bonus payments credited to contract holder accounts, annuity benefits and other adjustments. (6) 2002 includes decreases in policyholder account balances of $45 million for variable annuities and $56 million for fixed annuities due to the distribution of policy credits, subsequently paid out in cash, as demutualization consideration in connection with the Companys demutualization. 2001 includes increases to policyholder account values as a result of the issuance of the policyholder credits of $429 million for variable annuities and $157 million for fixed annuities. 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Sales of new life insurance, as measured by statutory first year premiums and deposits, decreased $63 million from 2001 to 2002. The decrease came from a $77 million decrease in the segments sales of corporate owned life insurance products, substantially all of which is sold by the third party distribution channel. A decrease of $63 million in sales of variable life insurance was more than offset by increased sales of our universal life insurance products, which we introduced in late 2001, and our term insurance products, reflecting revised product pricing. Sales by the third party distribution channel, other than corporate owned life insurance, increased $16 million in 2002 from 2001. During 2001, we began to expand the focus of third party distribution, which has historically served intermediaries who provide insurance solutions in support of estate and wealth transfer planning for affluent individuals and corporate owned life insurance for businesses, toward the mass affluent market. Life sales from Prudential Agents, excluding corporate owned life insurance, were essentially unchanged from 2001 to 2002, as the decline in the average number of agents was largely offset by an increase in productivity. The average number of Prudential Agents declined to approximately 4,500 for 2002, compared to approximately 5,200 for 2001. The decline in the number of average agents from 2001 reflected actions we took in 2001 to increase the productivity standards required to continue agents contracts. Prudential Agent productivity increased to $40,000 in 2002 from $35,000 in 2001. We measure Prudential Agent productivity as commissions on new sales of all products, not only life insurance, by Prudential Agents with us for the entire period, divided by the number of those Prudential Agents. We have not implemented further increases in these productivity standards for periods subsequent to 2001. While there can be no assurance, we believe that maintenance of these standards at their current level will contribute to stabilization in the number of Prudential Agents. 92 Table of Contents Total account values for fixed and variable annuities amounted to $18.7 billion as of December 31, 2002, a decrease of $3.0 billion from December 31, 2001. This decrease is due primarily to declines in market values of our variable annuities resulting from adverse market conditions as well as net redemptions. Net redemptions for 2002 were $451 million as compared to $1.2 billion in 2001. The $730 million decline in net redemptions is primarily the result of a $609 million increase in gross sales due to recent product and compensation enhancements as well as strengthening of distribution relationships. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Sales of new life insurance, as measured by statutory first year premiums and deposits, increased $83 million, or 21%, in 2001 from 2000. The increase came from a $157 million increase in the segments sales of corporate owned life insurance products, substantially all of which is sold by the third party distribution channel. Sales by the third party distribution channel, other than corporate owned life insurance, decreased $30 million, or 35%, in 2001 from 2000. Sales from Prudential Agents, excluding corporate owned life insurance, decreased $44 million, or 17%, in 2001 from 2000. The number of Prudential Agents declined to approximately 4,400 at December 31, 2001, from 6,100 at December 31, 2000, reflecting actions taken to increase the productivity standards required to continue agency contracts. Prudential Agent productivity increased slightly to $35,000 in 2001 from $34,700 in 2000. Total account values for fixed and variable annuities amounted to $21.7 billion as of December 31, 2001, a decrease of $2.3 billion from December 31, 2000. This decrease resulted primarily from declines in the market value of customers variable annuities as well as net redemptions, which increased from $839 million in 2000 to $1.2 billion in 2001. The net redemptions of fixed and variable annuities in 2001 were partially offset by policy credits we issued in connection with our demutualization, which increased policyholders account values by $586 million. Policy Surrender Experience The following table sets forth the individual life insurance businesss policy surrender experience for variable life insurance, measured by cash value of surrenders, for the periods indicated. These amounts do not correspond to expenses under GAAP. In managing this business, we analyze the cash value of surrenders because it is a measure of the degree to which policyholders are maintaining their in force business with us, a driver of future profitability. Our term life insurance products do not provide for cash surrender values. Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 ($ in millions) Cash value of surrenders $ 692 $ 637 $ 641 Cash value of surrenders as a percentage of mean future policy benefit reserves, policyholders account balances, and separate account balances 4.2 % 3.8 % 3.7 % 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. The total cash value of surrenders increased $55 million, or 9%, in 2002 from 2001. The level of surrenders as a percentage of mean future policy benefit reserves, policyholders account balances and separate account balances increased from 2001 to 2002, reflecting an increase in lapses associated with declines in variable life insurance account values. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. The total cash value of surrenders and the level of surrenders as a percentage of mean future policy benefit reserves, policyholders account balances and separate account balances were relatively constant from 2000 to 2001. 93 Table of Contents Group Insurance Operating Results The following table sets forth the Group Insurance segments operating results for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (in millions) Operating results: Revenues(1) $ 3,582 $ 3,248 $ 2,801 Benefits and expenses 3,427 3,178 2,643 Adjusted operating income 155 70 158 Realized investment losses, net (129 ) (72 ) (2 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes $ 26 $ (2 ) $ 156 (1) Revenues exclude realized investment losses, net, of $129 million, $72 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased $28 million, from a loss of $2 million in 2001 to income of $26 million in 2002. The increase includes an increase in adjusted operating income of $85 million, to $155 million in 2002, as discussed below. Partially offsetting this was an increase in realized investment losses, net, of $57 million, to losses of $129 million in 2002. For a discussion of realized investment losses, net, see Consolidated Results of Operations Realized Investment Gains. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $158 million, from $156 million in 2000 to a loss of $2 million in 2001. The decrease includes a decrease in adjusted operating income of $88 million, to $70 million in 2001, as discussed below, and an increase in realized investment losses, net, of $70 million, to losses of $72 million in 2001. Adjusted Operating Income 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Adjusted operating income increased $85 million from 2001 to 2002. Adjusted operating income for 2001 included a charge of approximately $36 million reflecting an increase in our estimate of group life insurance incurred but not reported claims. Adjusted operating income for 2002 benefited $19 million from refinements in reserve estimates recorded in the third quarter of 2002 relating to our group long term disability product. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income increased $30 million, or 28%, from 2001 due primarily to growth in both group life and disability earned premiums and a lower benefits ratio on group disability products. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Adjusted operating income decreased $88 million, or 56%, from 2000 to 2001. The decrease came primarily from less favorable mortality experience on group life insurance in 2001, which included an increase in our estimate of incurred but not reported claims. This increase in estimate had a negative impact of approximately $36 million on our adjusted operating income for 2001. The mortality experience on group life insurance was partially offset by earned premium growth and improved morbidity on group disability products. In addition, adjusted operating income benefited $32 million in 2000 from refinements in our calculations of reserves and return premiums for waiver of premium features. However, about half of this benefit was offset during 2000, primarily by a charge to increase the allowance for receivables. An increase in operating expenses, including $12 million of consulting costs in 2001, also contributed to the decrease in adjusted operating income. 94 Table of Contents Revenues 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Revenues, as shown in the table above under Operating Results, increased by $334 million, or 10%, from 2001 to 2002. Group life insurance premiums increased by $217 million, or 11%, to $2.222 billion primarily due to growth in business in force resulting from new sales, as described below, and continued strong persistency, which decreased from 97% in 2001 to 95% in 2002. We believe the decrease in persistency, which is primarily a result of the pricing adjustments implemented in 2002 discussed below, will likely continue in this highly competitive market. Group disability premiums, which include long term care products, increased by $67 million, or 13%, also reflecting the growth in business in force. Persistency decreased slightly from 89% in 2001 to 87% in 2002. Net investment income increased $31 million, or 6%, primarily due to a larger base of invested assets. The remainder of the increase in revenues came primarily from higher fees on products sold to employers for funding of employee benefit programs and retirement arrangements, reflecting growth in this business. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Revenues increased by $447 million, or 16%, from 2000 to 2001. Group life insurance premiums increased by $350 million, or 21%, to $2.005 billion primarily due to growth in business in force resulting from new sales and continued strong persistency, which increased from 95% in 2000 to 97% in 2001. Group disability premiums, which include long term care products, increased by $43 million, also reflecting the growth in business in force. Persistency decreased from 91% in 2000 to 89% in 2001, primarily due to the cancellation of a large case. Net investment income increased $62 million, or 13%, primarily due to a larger base of invested assets. Benefits and Expenses The following table sets forth the Group Insurance segments benefits and administrative operating expense ratios for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Benefits ratio(1): Group life 91.7 % 92.6 % 85.8 % Group disability 87.9 95.2 101.9 Administrative operating expense ratio(2): Group life 10.0 10.0 11.6 Group disability 22.0 23.6 21.0 (1) Ratio of policyholder benefits to earned premiums, policy charges and fee income. Group disability ratios include long term care products. (2) Ratio of administrative operating expenses (excluding commissions) to gross premiums, policy charges and fee income. 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under Operating Results, increased by $249 million, or 8%, from 2001 to 2002. The increase resulted in large part from an increase of $213 million, or 9%, in policyholders benefits, including the change in policy reserves. Excluding the reserve refinements noted above, policyholders benefits increased $268 million, or 11%, reflecting the growth of business in force. Based on our evaluation of mortality experience during 2001, we reviewed our pricing policies to determine whether our pricing structure provides for adequate margins and returns on all of our group insurance products. As a result of this review, in the fourth quarter of 2001 we commenced pricing adjustments, when contractually permitted, which consider the deterioration of the benefits ratio on our group life insurance products since 2000. During 2002, we reviewed about 44% of our 2001 group life insurance business premiums in force and, where appropriate, implemented pricing adjustments. While there can be no assurance, we expect these actions, as well as pricing discipline in writing new business, will allow us to achieve gradual improvements in our loss ratios, although the impact has so far been limited by a highly competitive market. The implementation of these actions resulted in a modest decline in persistency on our group life insurance business in force and, consistent with our expectations, some slowing of our sales. An increase of $25 million, or 5%, in operating expenses, including amortization of deferred acquisition costs, also contributed to the increase in benefits and expenses. The increase in operating expenses, from $466 million in 2001 to $491 million in 2002, resulted primarily from the growth in business in force and related sales based compensation costs. 95 Table of Contents The group life benefits ratio for 2002 improved 0.9 percentage points from 2001. Absent the negative impact to 2001 from the reserve refinements, the 2002 group life benefits ratio increased 0.8 percentage points reflecting higher claim incidence, primarily early in the year. The group disability benefits ratio improved by 7.3 percentage points from 2001 to 2002. The reserve refinements recorded in the third quarter of 2002 relating to our group long term disability product represented 3.2 percentage points of the improvement. The remainder of the improvement reflects improved case resolution and our ongoing efforts to improve the quality of our underwriting and claims management processes. The group life administrative operating expense ratio remained flat from 2001 to 2002. The group disability administrative operating expense ratio improved from 2001 to 2002 reflecting the impact of our efforts to improve operational efficiencies. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Benefits and expenses increased by $535 million, or 20%, from 2000 to 2001. The increase resulted in large part from an increase of $448 million, or 22%, in policyholders benefits, including the change in policy reserves. This increase reflected less favorable group life insurance claims experience in 2001, which included an increase in our estimate of incurred but not reported claims, as well as the growth of business in force. As a result of our reinsurance coverages, insurance losses resulting from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the U.S. did not have a material impact on our results. An increase of $64 million, or 16%, in operating expenses also contributed to the increase in benefits and expenses. The increase in operating expenses, from $402 million in 2000 to $466 million in 2001, resulted primarily from sales based compensation costs driven by the increase in group life insurance sales. Additionally, expenses in 2001 included $12 million of consulting costs to enhance our underwriting and other business processes. The group life benefits ratio for 2001 increased 6.8 percentage points from 2000 primarily as a result of the less favorable claims experience on our group life insurance business in 2001. About 4 percentage points of the increase in the group life benefits ratio came from the increase in estimate of incurred but not reported claims and the net impact of the refinements in reserve calculations and charge to increase the allowance for receivables in 2000. The group disability benefits ratio improved by 6.7 percentage points from 2000 to 2001 reflecting better morbidity experience, which we attribute to accelerated case resolution and our ongoing efforts to improve the quality of our underwriting and claims management processes as well as the impact of our increase in the allowance for receivables, which contributed about 2 percentage points to the 2000 ratio. The group life administrative operating expense ratio improved 1.6 percentage points, reflecting the impact of our efforts to improve operational efficiencies. The group disability insurance administrative operating expense ratio increased 2.6 percentage points, reflecting the favorable impact, in 2000, of changes in our estimate of the administrative costs associated with settlement of pending claims. Sales Results The following table sets forth the Group Insurance segments new annualized premiums for the periods indicated. In managing our group insurance business, we analyze new annualized premiums, which do not correspond to revenues under GAAP, as well as revenues, because new annualized premiums measure the current sales performance of the business unit, while revenues reflect the renewal persistency and aging of in force policies written in prior years and net investment income in addition to current sales. Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (in millions) New annualized premiums:(1) Group life $ 269 $ 435 $ 321 Group disability(2) 160 139 154 Total $ 429 $ 574 $ 475 (1) Amounts exclude new premiums resulting from rate changes on existing policies, from additional coverage issued under our Servicemembers Group Life Insurance contract and from excess premiums on group universal life insurance that build cash value but do not purchase face amounts. (2) Includes long term care products. 96 Table of Contents 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Total new annualized premiums decreased $145 million, or 25%, from 2001 to 2002 due to a decrease in group life sales. The group life sales decrease came from a decrease in sales to new customers reflecting a sale of $99 million to one large customer in 2001 and the expected slowing of our sales due to the implementation of pricing adjustments in 2002, partially offset by increased sales to existing customers. Group disability sales increased in 2002 due primarily to one large fourth quarter sale. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Total new annualized premiums increased $99 million, or 21%, from 2000 to 2001, with an increase of $114 million in group life sales partially offset by a $15 million decline in group disability sales. The group life sales increase came from a small number of large sales to new and existing customers, including annualized premiums of $99 million from one sale. The group disability sales decrease reflected the benefit to 2000 results from sales opportunities resulting from the well publicized financial difficulties of a competitor. Property and Casualty Insurance Operating Results The following table sets forth the Property and Casualty Insurance segments operating results for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (in millions) Operating results: Revenues(1) $ 2,209 $ 2,051 $ 1,800 Benefits and expenses 2,199 1,956 1,650 Adjusted operating income 10 95 150 Realized investment gains (losses), net (6 ) (4 ) 16 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes $ 4 $ 91 $ 166 (1) Revenues exclude realized investment gains (losses), net, of $(6) million, $(4) million and $16 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $87 million, from $91 million in 2001 to $4 million in 2002. The decrease reflects an $85 million decline in adjusted operating income in 2002 from 2001, as discussed below. Additionally, realized investment losses, net, increased $2 million, to losses of $6 million in 2002. For a discussion of realized investment losses, net, see Consolidated Results of Operations Realized Investment Gains. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $75 million, from $166 million in 2000 to $91 million in 2001. The decrease reflects a $55 million decline in adjusted operating income in 2001 to 2000, as discussed below. Additionally, realized investment losses, net, amounted to $4 million in 2001, as compared to realized investment gains, net, of $16 million in 2000. Adjusted Operating Income 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Adjusted operating income decreased $85 million, or 89%, from 2001 to 2002. Results for 2002 reflected a $103 million lower net benefit from prior accident year development and a $39 million lower benefit from stop loss reinsurance recoveries. Also impacting the 2002 result was a $33 million charge to write off the goodwill associated with a reporting unit within this segment. This charge was the outcome of our annual impairment test. Partially offsetting these declines were premium increases reflecting rate increases we have implemented, and lower expenses as a result of our expense reduction efforts. 97 Table of Contents As previously announced, we are exploring options related to our personal lines property and casualty insurance business, including the possible sale of all or part of these operations, while no decision has yet been made. Based upon current market conditions, we believe that a sale of these operations would result in a charge to earnings that could be material to quarterly or annual net income, although the amount of any charge will depend on the terms of any such agreement. The Individual Life and Annuities segment is compensated for property and casualty insurance products sold through its distribution network. In the event of a sale of the property and casualty operations that resulted in continued access to non proprietary property and casualty products by the Prudential Agents, as expected by management, the Individual Life and Annuities segment would expect to continue to be compensated for sales of these products, although the extent of these revenues cannot be predicted. In addition, certain expenses incurred at the corporate level are allocated to the Property and Casualty Insurance segment. Although we would seek to reduce the level of these expenses in the event of a sale of our property and casualty insurance business, these corporate level expenses would initially result in greater charges within adjusted operating income reported for Corporate and Other operations. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Adjusted operating income decreased $55 million, or 37%, from 2000 to 2001. Results for 2001 reflected a $59 million lower benefit from prior accident year development. Adjusted operating income in 2000 reflected the negative impact of $40 million that we provided for premium refunds or credits to certain New Jersey automobile policyholders under that states excess profits regulations. Partially offsetting this was a $35 million decrease in net investment income in 2001 from 2000. In May 2000, we completed the acquisition of the specialty automobile business of the St. Paul Companies, which writes in the non standard automobile insurance business. While, as discussed under Revenues below, this acquisition had an effect on the comparison of revenues for 2001 to 2000, it did not have a material impact on adjusted operating income. Revenues The following table sets forth the Property and Casualty Insurance segments earned premiums, which are net of reinsurance ceded, for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (in millions) Automobile $ 1,547 $ 1,403 $ 1,153 Homeowners 467 448 413 Other 34 33 33 Total earned premiums $ 2,048 $ 1,884 $ 1,599 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Revenues, as shown in the table above under Operating Results, increased $158 million, or 8%, from 2001 to 2002, as a result of an increase in earned premiums. Total earned premiums, as shown in the immediately preceding table, increased by $164 million or 9% from 2001 to 2002. Automobile earned premiums increased $144 million, or 10%. The increases in automobile and homeowners insurance earned premiums came primarily from rate increases. We plan to continue pursuing rate increases, and expect to implement rate increases in 2003 at a level generally similar to those of 2002. As discussed below under Benefits and Expenses, commencing in the second half of 2001 we suspended our mailing solicitations for the direct distribution channel and limited the growth of new business from certain distribution channels other than Prudential Agents, based on our evaluation of the quality of the business from these alternative channels. In October 2001, we announced that we would no longer write business through our property and casualty insurance career agency channel except in a few selected markets. Since that time, we have been in the process of re underwriting and non renewing of business that has produced adverse loss experience, to the extent permitted contractually and by state insurance regulations. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Revenues increased $251 million, or 14%, from 2000 to 2001. The $251 million increase included an increase of $96 million in revenues from the subsidiary we acquired in May 98 Table of Contents 2000 that specializes in non standard automobile business, which is included in 2000 results only from the date of acquisition. The remaining revenue increase of $155 million, from our existing business, came primarily from a $196 million increase in earned premiums from automobile and homeowners insurance, partially offset by a $41 million decline in investment income. Total earned premiums increased by $285 million, or 18%, from 2000 to 2001. Excluding the impact of the acquisition mentioned above, earned premiums increased by $196 million, including the effect of a $40 million reduction in 2000 premiums from the provision for premium refunds or credits to certain New Jersey automobile policyholders, as noted above. Automobile earned premiums increased by $250 million, or 22%, from 2000 to 2001, including $89 million from the non standard automobile business and the effect of the $40 million reduction in 2000 premiums mentioned above. The remaining $121 million increase came primarily from new distribution channels we implemented during 1999 and 2000, including career agents focused on selling property and casualty insurance, workplace and affinity marketing, direct distribution, and independent agents, many of whom were producers for the acquired subsidiary. Improved persistency in 2001 also contributed to the growth in earned premiums. Homeowners earned premiums increased $35 million, or 8%, from 2000 to 2001 due to lower reinsurance premiums ceded, as the number of policies in force was relatively unchanged. This stabilization of our policies in force represented an improvement compared with declines in prior years, which reflected intense rate competition that attracted customers to other companies. Net investment income decreased by $35 million, or 18%, from $193 million in 2000 to $158 million in 2001, and decreased by $41 million excluding the impact of the acquisition mentioned above. This decrease was primarily a result of a lower average base of invested assets, reflecting lower attributed capital, and a decline in investment yield. Benefits and Expenses The following table shows our calendar year loss, expense and combined ratios, the impact on these calendar year ratios of catastrophic losses and our accident year combined ratios based on loss experience for the periods indicated (all based on amounts determined under statutory accounting principles). Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Loss ratio(1): Automobile 78.3 % 70.6 % 64.0 % Homeowners 80.2 76.5 72.4 Overall 78.7 70.8 65.8 Expense ratio(2): Automobile 28.0 30.8 35.3 Homeowners 32.2 36.6 45.3 Overall 29.0 32.1 37.8 Combined ratio(3): Automobile 106.3 101.4 99.3 Homeowners 112.4 113.1 117.7 Overall 107.7 102.9 103.6 Effect of catastrophic losses included in combined ratio(4): 1.5 2.2 2.7 Accident year combined ratio(5): 107.4 110.2 114.5 (1) Represents ratio of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses to earned premium. Ratios reflect the net development in the calendar period from prior accident year reserves of $3 million (favorable) in the year ended December 31, 2002, $106 million (favorable) in 2001, and $165 million (favorable) in 2000. Ratios also reflect recoveries from current accident year stop loss reinsurance contracts of $41 million in the year ended December 31, 2002 and $80 million in each of the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. (2) Represents ratio of operating expenses to net written premium. (3) Represents the sum of (1) and (2). (4) Represents losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to catastrophes that are included in the combined ratio. Our calendar year catastrophe losses include both current and prior accident year losses. We classify as catastrophes those events that are declared 99 Table of Contents catastrophes by Property Claims Services, which is an industry organization that declares and tracks all property related catastrophes causing insured property damage in the U.S. Property Claims Services declares an event a catastrophe if it causes in excess of a specified dollar amount of insured property damage, which was $25 million throughout the periods presented, and affects a significant number of policyholders and insurance companies. (5) Accident year combined ratios reflect the combined ratios for accidents that occur in the indicated calendar year, restated to reflect subsequent changes in loss estimates for those claims based on cumulative loss data through December 31, 2002. These ratios reflect the recoveries from stop loss reinsurance contracts as noted above. We analyze accident year combined ratios because they reflect the actual loss experience of accidents that occur in a given period excluding the effect of accidents that occur in other periods. 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Our automobile loss ratio, as shown in the table immediately above, increased from 2001 to 2002 primarily due to the lower net benefit from prior accident year reserve development in 2002, of $72 million, and $22 million of lesser benefits from stop loss reinsurance recoveries. During 2002, we released $68 million of reserves related to our New Jersey auto business due to continued favorable development in claim cost trends, but strengthened reserves for our non New Jersey business by $44 million because our claims experience was less favorable than we previously estimated in establishing reserves for prior accident years. In 2001, we released $94 million of reserves related to our New Jersey business, while the results of the non New Jersey business were not impacted significantly by changes in estimates of prior accident year loss reserves. Based on an evaluation conducted in 2001 of the quality of the new business produced through distribution channels we implemented in 1999 and 2000, we discontinued our mailing solicitations for the direct distribution channel and limited the growth of business from some of our other distribution channels, commencing in the third quarter of 2001. In October 2001, we announced that we would no longer write business through our property and casualty insurance career agency channel except in a few selected markets. We have been in the process of re underwriting and non renewing business that has produced adverse loss experience to the extent permitted contractually and by state insurance regulations, and pursuing rate increases across our business. These efforts have not yet affected the loss ratio significantly, as the business produced prior to their implementation will continue to affect the accident year results until the associated premiums are fully earned. Our ability to implement re underwriting and non renewal measures has been limited by regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions. Consistent with our geographic market segmentation strategy, we have ceased writing new homeowners business in a number of states to further reduce our exposure to catastrophes consistent with our profitability objectives. The 3.7 point increase in the homeowners loss ratio from 2001 to 2002 is due to a $16 million higher unfavorable development on prior accident year losses and a reduction of $11 million in stop loss reinsurance recoveries, partially offset by $4 million lower catastrophe losses in 2002 on this business and the impact of rate increases implemented on homeowners policies. Total calendar year catastrophe losses amounted to $31 million for 2002 compared to $42 million in 2001. Losses that we ceded through reinsurance, including stop loss reinsurance, resulted in decreases in the total combined ratio of 3.8 percentage points for 2002 and 7.3 percentage points for 2001. Our overall expense ratio has continued to improve, by 3.1 percentage points from 2001 to 2002, as we benefited in 2002 from staff reductions and the favorable impact of the increased premium base. The decrease in the accident year combined ratio resulted from the decline in the expense ratio. Recoveries from stop loss reinsurance resulted in decreases in the accident year combined ratio of 2.0 percentage points in 2002 and 4.3 percentage points in 2001. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Our automobile loss ratio increased from 2000 to 2001 primarily due to the lower net benefit from prior accident year reserve development in 2001. We released reserves of $106 million in 2001 and $165 million in 2000 primarily because our automobile casualty claims experience for prior years was more favorable than we previously estimated in establishing reserves for these accident years. The impact of experience on new automobile business also contributed to the increase in this ratio, since the experience on our seasoned automobile business was relatively consistent. We added significant new automobile business during 2001, primarily in the first half of the year. 100 Table of Contents The increase in the homeowners loss ratio came from a 16% increase in claim severity and a 3% increase in claim frequency. Our stop loss reinsurance recoveries resulted in decreases in the homeowners combined ratio of 5.4 percentage points in 2001 and had no impact in 2000. Our calendar year catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, amounted to $42 million for 2001 compared to $45 million for 2000. Losses that we ceded through reinsurance, including stop loss reinsurance, resulted in decreases in the total combined ratio of 7.3 percentage points for 2001 and 8.3 percentage points for 2000. Our overall expense ratio for 2001 decreased from 2000, as we incurred costs in 2000 to develop our distribution channels and benefited in 2001 from staff reductions and the favorable impact of the increased premium base. The decrease in the accident year combined ratio resulted from the decline in the expense ratio. Recoveries from stop loss reinsurance resulted in decreases in the accident year combined ratio of 4.3 percentage points in 2001 and 4.8 percentage points in 2000. Investment Division Investment Management Operating Results The following table sets forth the Investment Management segments operating results for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (in millions) Operating results: Revenues(1) $ 1,235 $ 1,357 $ 1,467 Expenses 1,096 1,216 1,262 Adjusted operating income 139 141 205 Realized investment gains (losses), net 64 (8 ) 1 Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 203 $ 133 $ 206 (1) Revenues exclude realized investment gains (losses), net, of $64 million, $(8) million and $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 2002 includes a gain of $59 million from the sale of a specialized asset management subsidiary. Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased $70 million, from $133 million in 2001 to $203 million in 2002. The increase reflects realized investment gains, net, of $64 million in 2002, as compared to losses of $8 million in 2001. For a discussion of realized investment gains (losses), net, see Consolidated Results of Operations Realized Investment Gains. Adjusted operating income was essentially unchanged from 2001 to 2002, as discussed below. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $73 million, from $206 million in 2000 to $133 million in 2001. The decrease is primarily the result of a $64 million decline in adjusted operating income, as discussed below. Realized investment gains, net, were $1 million in 2000 compared to realized investment losses, net, of $8 million in 2001. 101 Table of Contents Adjusted Operating Income 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Adjusted operating income for 2002 was essentially unchanged from 2001. Lower fee revenues resulting from declines in market value of the underlying equity assets under management as well as lower average mutual fund customer account balances on which our fees are based, and lower mortgage loan origination and servicing revenue were largely offset by a decrease in expenses resulting from the decline in revenue and cost saving measures implemented in 2001. We incurred $23 million and $55 million of employee termination and facilities consolidation costs in 2002 and 2001, respectively. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Adjusted operating income decreased $64 million, from $205 million in 2000 to $141 million in 2001 due primarily to lower earnings from asset management and lower asset based distribution revenues resulting from declines in market value of the underlying assets on which our fees our based. Although 2000 adjusted operating income reflected expenses related to the consolidation of substantially all of our public equity management capabilities into our Jennison unit, these expenses were largely offset by revenues from performance incentive fees that exceeded those earned in 2001. Revenues The following table sets forth the Investment Management segments revenues, as shown in the table above under Operating Results, by source for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (in millions) Revenues: Retail customers(1) $ 184 $ 210 $ 244 Institutional customers 335 383 409 General account 221 227 221 Sub total 740 820 874 Mutual fund revenues(2) 495 537 593 Total revenues $ 1,235 $ 1,357 $ 1,467 (1) Consists of individual mutual funds and both variable annuities and variable life insurance asset management revenues in our separate accounts. Fixed annuities and the fixed rate options of both variable annuities and variable life insurance are included in general account. Also includes funds invested in proprietary mutual funds through our defined contribution plan products. (2) Represents mutual fund revenues other than asset management fees paid to affiliates, which are included in the appropriate categories above. 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Revenues, as shown in the table above under Operating Results, decreased $122 million, from $1.357 billion in 2001 to $1.235 billion in 2002. The decrease came from a decline of $74 million in revenues from management of institutional and retail customer assets as well as a decline of $42 million in our mutual fund revenue. The decrease in revenues from management of institutional and retail customer assets came primarily from declines in market value of the underlying equity assets under management on which our fees are based, as well as lower loan origination and servicing revenue. The decline in mutual fund revenues was the result of lower average market values of customer accounts on which our fees are based. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Revenues decreased $110 million, from $1.467 billion in 2000 to $1.357 billion in 2001. The decrease came primarily from declines of $34 million in revenues from the management of retail customer assets and $26 million from management of institutional customer assets. The decrease in revenues from management of retail customer assets came primarily from market value declines on publicly traded equity securities which resulted in a lower level of average assets under management. The decrease in revenues from management of institutional customer assets reflected a $25 million performance incentive fee earned in 2000. Our mutual fund revenues decreased $56 million primarily due to lower asset based distribution revenues as well as a lower level of fee producing redemptions. 102 Table of Contents Expenses 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Expenses, as shown in the table above under Operating Results, decreased $120 million, from $1.216 billion in 2001 to $1.096 billion in 2002. The decrease primarily reflects decreases in incentive compensation expenses. Additionally, our 2002 results reflect savings associated with cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2001. In 2002 and 2001 our results reflect $23 million and $55 million, respectively, in employee termination and facility consolidation costs. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Expenses decreased $46 million, from $1.262 billion in 2000 to $1.216 billion in 2001 due primarily to a decrease in general and administrative expenses reflecting our expense management efforts and lower sales based and asset based compensation expense. Additionally, our 2001 results included expenses for the entire year relating to the mortgage origination and servicing activities of a subsidiary that we acquired in June 2000, while our 2000 results included approximately $40 million of expenses related to the consolidation of substantially all of our public equity management capabilities into our Jennison unit. Financial Advisory Operating Results The following table sets forth the Financial Advisory segments operating results for the periods indicated. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, there was no activity that resulted in items excluded from adjusted operating income. Therefore, results of this segment were the same on both an adjusted operating income basis and a GAAP basis. Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (in millions) Operating results: Non interest revenues $ 2,280 $ 2,495 $ 3,090 Net interest revenues 175 256 310 Total revenues, net of interest expense 2,455 2,751 3,400 Total non interest expenses 2,496 2,887 3,001 Adjusted operating income $ (41 ) $ (136 ) $ 399 In February 2003, we announced an agreement with Wachovia Corporation (Wachovia) to combine each companys respective retail securities brokerage and clearing operations to form a new firm, which will be headquartered in Richmond, VA. Under the agreement we will have a 38% ownership interest in the new firm, which we will account for under the equity method of accounting, while Wachovia will own the remaining 62%. The transaction, which includes our securities brokerage operations, but does not include equity sales, trading and research operations or our consumer banking operations, is anticipated to close in the third quarter of 2003. This transaction is subject, among other things, to regulatory approvals and filings and customary closing conditions. Adjusted Operating Income 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. The Financial Advisory segment reported losses, on an adjusted operating income basis, of $41 million for 2002 and $136 million for 2001. The $95 million decline in the segments loss came primarily from reduced losses in our securities brokerage operations, which reported a loss of $87 million for 2002 as compared to a loss of $180 million for 2001. These operations incurred costs of $38 million in 2002 and $65 million in 2001 to reduce staffing levels, occupancy and other overhead costs. The reduction in the loss reflects lower non interest expenses resulting from these actions, as well as the $27 million decrease in implementation costs, which together more than offset the negative impact of the continued decline in retail client commissions and net interest revenue. Adjusted operating income from our equity sales and trading operations increased $4 million, to $44 million for 2002. Adjusted operating income for 2001 included $20 million that Prudential Securities earned as co manager in the initial public offering of our Common Stock during the fourth quarter of 2001, which is offset by a corresponding charge in our Corporate and Other results. 103 Table of Contents The improved results of our equity sales and trading operations are due primarily to our cost reduction initiatives and a decrease in costs associated with implementing these initiatives, from $15 million in 2001 to $5 million in 2002. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. The Financial Advisory segment reported a loss of $136 million, on an adjusted operating income basis, for 2001 compared to adjusted operating income of $399 million for 2000. The $535 million decline came primarily from a $442 million decrease from our securities brokerage operations, which reported a loss of $180 million for 2001 compared to adjusted operating income of $262 million in 2000. These operations were adversely affected in 2001 by a decline in individual investor transaction volume and margin loan balances, which resulted in decreased commission and net interest revenues. These revenue declines were coupled with increased costs of recruiting and retaining Financial Advisors, including increased expenses relating to recruiting and retention incentives extended to experienced Financial Advisors. Additionally, we incurred costs of $65 million in 2001 from employee terminations associated with staff reductions, as well as branch closings and facilities consolidations. Adjusted operating income from our equity sales and trading operations decreased $50 million from $90 million in 2000, to $40 million in 2001. Adjusted operating income for 2001 included $20 million that Prudential Securities earned as co manager in the initial public offering of our Common Stock, as discussed above. The decrease in adjusted operating income reflected a decline in our revenues from principal trading activities supporting retail and institutional customers as well as increased costs from employee terminations associated with staff reductions and facilities consolidations. The remaining $43 million decrease in the segments adjusted operating income came from our consumer banking operations, which benefited in 2000 from the sale of a major portion of the consumer banks credit card receivables. Revenues The following table sets forth the Financial Advisory segments revenues, as shown in the table above under Operating Results, by source for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (in millions) Commissions $ 1,383 $ 1,525 $ 1,985 Fees 750 758 825 Other 147 212 280 Total non interest revenues 2,280 2,495 3,090 Net interest revenues 175 256 310 Total revenues, net of interest expense $ 2,455 $ 2,751 $ 3,400 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Total revenues, net of interest expense, as shown in the table above under Operating Results, decreased $296 million from 2001 to 2002. The decrease came primarily from a $248 million decline in revenues from our securities brokerage operations, from $2.303 billion in 2001 to $2.055 billion in 2002. Commission revenues decreased $142 million from 2001 to 2002. The decrease came from a $154 million decline in commissions in our securities brokerage operations, from $1.200 billion in 2001 to $1.046 billion in 2002, due primarily to a decline in over the counter and listed equity securities transactions. Commission revenues continue to be negatively affected by less active securities markets and reduced client transaction volume. The decrease in commissions in our securities brokerage operations was partially offset by an increase of $12 million from our equity sales and trading operations. Commission revenue for 2001 included $10 million that Prudential Securities received as co manager in the initial public offering of our Common Stock. The improvement for 2002 is the result of increased over the counter equity commissions from our institutional customers. Fee revenues, which include asset management and account service fees, were essentially unchanged from 2002 to 2001. Fee revenues benefited from new assets gathered in the wrap fee and managed accounts, as well as 104 Table of Contents an increase in account service fees, reflecting a revised pricing schedule implemented at the beginning of 2002. However, the negative impact of market value declines on wrap fee managed account assets under management, competitive pricing pressures, changes in product mix and market value declines on clients mutual funds, on which a portion of our fees are based, offset these improvements. Fee revenues accounted for 33% of total non interest revenues in 2002, compared to 30% in 2001, reflecting the decrease in commission revenues and actions we have taken to increase the contribution of recurring revenues. Other revenues decreased $65 million from 2001 to 2002. The decrease is primarily attributable to our equity sales and trading operations, which included $12 million in fee revenue received in 2001 as co manager in the initial public offering of our Common Stock. The reduced trading revenues we experienced primarily reflected reduced trading spread in the equities securities markets. Net interest revenues decreased $81 million from 2001 to 2002, primarily as a result of a decrease in average customer margin lending and other customer related balances of our securities brokerage operations, reflecting the reduced level of individual investor activity. Average customer margin lending balances were $2.9 billion in 2002 compared to $4.4 billion in 2001. The number of retail Financial Advisors was 4,377 at December 31, 2002, a decrease of 22% from 5,585 at December 31, 2001. The majority of the decline from 2001 came from Financial Advisors with less than 4 years of industry experience and reflects the attrition of less experienced Financial Advisors and a decrease in our hiring of inexperienced Financial Advisors to be trained by us. Assets under management and client assets decreased $37 billion to $220 billion at December 31, 2002 from $257 billion at December 31, 2001, primarily as a result of overall market value declines. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Total revenues, net of interest expense, decreased $649 million, or 19%, from 2000 to 2001. The decrease came primarily from a $517 million decline in revenues from our securities brokerage operations, from $2.820 billion in 2000 to $2.303 billion in 2001. Commission revenues decreased $460 million, or 23%, from 2000 to 2001. The decrease came from a $420 million decline in commissions in our securities brokerage operations from $1.620 billion in 2000 to $1.200 billion in 2001. This decrease is primarily from over the counter and listed equity securities transactions. Commission revenues were negatively affected in 2001 by less active securities markets and reduced retail transaction volume, and benefited in 2000 from exceptionally active over the counter equity markets and related retail transaction volume in the first four months of the year. Commissions from our equity sales and trading operations decreased $40 million from $365 million in 2000 to $325 million in 2001, which included revenues of $10 million that Prudential Securities received as co manager in the initial public offering of our Common Stock. Commission revenues in 2000 benefited from exceptionally active equity securities markets during the first four months of the year. Fee revenues, which include asset management and account service fees, declined $67 million, or 8%, from 2000 to 2001. The decline came from a decrease in revenues from wrap fee products, reflecting competitive pricing pressures and changes in product mix, as well as the negative impact of market value declines. The negative impact of market value declines on wrap fee and managed account assets under management essentially offset the impact of new assets gathered in these accounts. Additionally, the negative impact of market value declines on clients mutual funds, on which a portion of our fees are based, contributed to the decline in fee revenues. Other revenues decreased $68 million, or 24%, from 2000 to 2001. This decrease came primarily from declines of $43 million in our equity sales and trading operations and $36 million in our consumer banking operations. Revenues in our equity sales and trading operations in 2001, which included $12 million associated with the initial public offering of our Common Stock, were negatively affected by reduced revenues from principal trading supporting retail and institutional customers, while 2000 revenues benefited from exceptionally active equity securities markets during the first four months of the year. The decrease for the consumer banking operations is due primarily to the sale of a major portion of the consumer banks credit card receivables in 2000. 105 Table of Contents Net interest revenues decreased $54 million, or 17%, from 2000 to 2001, primarily as a result of a decrease in average customer margin lending balances of our securities brokerage operations, related to the reduced level of individual investor activity. Average customer margin lending balances were $4.4 billion in 2001 compared to $6.6 billion in 2000. Increased investment income on greater attributed capital partially offset the impact of lower average customer margin lending balances. The number of retail Financial Advisors was 5,585 at December 31, 2001, a decrease of 8% from 6,103 at December 31, 2000. Approximately 90% of the decline came from Financial Advisors with less than 4 years industry experience with us, and reflected a decrease in our recruiting of inexperienced Financial Advisors to be trained by us. Assets under management and client assets decreased $21 billion to $257 billion at December 31, 2001 from $278 billion at December 31, 2000, primarily as a result of overall market value declines. Non Interest Expenses 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Total non interest expenses, as shown in the table above under Operating Results, decreased $391 million, or 14%, from 2001 to 2002. Non interest expenses included costs incurred to reduce staffing levels, occupancy and other overhead costs of $65 million at our securities brokerage operations and $15 million attributable to our equity sales and trading operations in 2001, compared to 2002 amounts of $38 million for securities brokerage operations and $5 million for equity sales and trading operations. The remainder of the decrease came primarily from the reduced cost structure resulting from the actions taken and declines in revenue based compensation costs. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Total non interest expenses decreased $114 million from 2000 to 2001. Non interest expenses for our securities brokerage operation decreased due to the lower level of revenues and earnings in 2001, but the decrease was not proportional to the revenue decline largely due to the recruiting and retention incentives as described above as well as $65 million in costs to reduce staffing levels, occupancy and other overhead costs incurred in 2001. Non interest expenses for our equity sales and trading operations decreased from $398 million in 2000 to $369 million in 2001, reflecting decreased compensation expenses driven by the declines in revenue and earnings as well as $15 million in costs to reduce staffing levels, occupancy and other overhead costs incurred in 2001. Retirement Operating Results The following table sets forth the Retirement segments operating results for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (in millions) Operating results: Revenues(1) $ 2,359 $ 2,394 $ 2,624 Benefits and expenses(2) 2,218 2,284 2,437 Adjusted operating income 141 110 187 Realized investment losses, net, and related charges (376 ) (86 ) (116 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes $ (235 ) $ 24 $ 71 (1) Revenues exclude realized investment losses, net, of $383 million, $100 million, and $85 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. (2) Benefits and expenses exclude the impact of net realized investment gains and losses on change in reserves and deferred policy acquisition cost amortization of $(7) million, $(14) million, and $31 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 106 Table of Contents Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. The segments loss from continuing operations before income taxes was $235 million in 2002 compared to income of $24 million in 2001. The decrease from 2001 reflects an increase in realized investment losses, net, and related charges of $290 million, partially offset by a $31 million increase in adjusted operating income as discussed below. For a discussion of realized investment losses, net, and related charges see Consolidated Results of Operations Realized Investment Gains. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $47 million, from $71 million in 2000 to $24 million in 2001. This decrease reflects a $77 million decline in adjusted operating income, as discussed below, partially offset by a decline in realized investment losses, net, and related charges of $30 million, from $116 million in 2000 to $86 million in 2001. Adjusted Operating Income 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Adjusted operating income increased $31 million, or 28%, in 2002 from 2001 reflecting an increase in adjusted operating income of $26 million from our guaranteed products business and a $5 million reduction in the loss from our full service defined contribution business. Our guaranteed products business reported adjusted operating income of $165 million in 2002. The increase reflects income in 2002 of $30 million from a mortgage loan prepayment and the recording of a $29 million charge to recognize increased estimates of policy liabilities in 2001. Absent the impact of these items, adjusted operating income decreased $33 million, or 20%, mostly due to lower investment results in 2002. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Adjusted operating income decreased $77 million, or 41%, in 2001 from 2000. Adjusted operating income benefited $64 million in 2000 primarily from refinements in our annuity reserves. Excluding this change, adjusted operating income decreased $13 million, or 11%. The $13 million decrease came from a decrease in adjusted operating income of $26 million from our guaranteed products business, partially offset by a $13 million reduction in losses from our full service defined contribution business. Our guaranteed products business reported adjusted operating income of $139 million in 2001, a decrease of $26 million from 2000 adjusted operating income, excluding the impact of the annuity reserve refinements noted above. Results from this business in 2000 were negatively affected by a $56 million charge we recorded to increase reserves for our structured settlement products as a result of our restructuring of the investment portfolio supporting these products to reduce the emphasis on equity investments, and we also recorded charges amounting to $26 million during that year to establish reserves for guaranteed benefits on several separate account contracts. However, the impact of the foregoing items was largely offset by less favorable mortality experience in 2001, and, during the first nine months of 2001, we recorded approximately $29 million of increased estimates of policy liabilities relating to prior periods. This business was also adversely affected by the gradual runoff of our general account products, including general account GIC business. Our full service defined contribution business, which benefited from lower expense levels in 2001, reported a loss of $29 million on an adjusted operating income basis compared to a loss of $42 million in 2000. Revenues 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Revenues, as shown in the table above under Operating Results, decreased $35 million from 2001 to 2002. Net investment income decreased $74 million, or 3%, from $2.148 billion in 2001 to $2.074 billion in 2002. The decrease in net investment income is due to a decline in yields on invested assets, partially offset by $30 million of income from a mortgage loan prepayment. Premiums increased $57 million on our guaranteed products business primarily due to increased sales of structured settlement and single sum products and the recording of increased estimates of policy liabilities for return premiums in 2001. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Revenues decreased $230 million, or 9%, from 2000 to 2001. Net investment income decreased $159 million, or 7%, from $2.307 billion in 2000 to $2.148 billion in 2001 reflecting lower yields as well as the gradual runoff of our general account products, including general account 107 Table of Contents GIC business. Premiums, policy charges and fees decreased $49 million, from $149 million in 2000 to $100 million in 2001, reflecting lower sales of general account group annuity products. Benefits and Expenses 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under Operating Results, decreased $66 million, or 3%, from 2001 to 2002. Policyholders benefits, together with the change in policy reserves and interest credited to policyholders, decreased $32 million from 2001 to 2002 reflecting the decline in yields and increased estimates on policy liabilities recorded in 2001. These items were partly offset by the increase in premium activity noted above. Operating expenses for our defined contribution business decreased $21 million due primarily to cost reduction measures implemented in prior periods. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Benefits and expenses decreased $153 million, or 6%, from 2000 to 2001. This decrease includes the effect of refinements in our annuity reserves in 2000 as noted above. Excluding this change, benefits and expenses decreased $217 million, or 9%. Policyholders benefits together with the change in policy reserves and interest credited to policyholders, decreased $128 million in 2001 from 2000, excluding the effect of the 2000 refinement in annuity reserves. The decrease reflected our maturing block of group annuity business and the decline in premiums mentioned above. In addition, operating expenses for our defined contribution business decreased $39 million due primarily to cost reduction measures implemented in prior periods. Interest expense decreased $31 million from 2000 to 2001 as a result of a lower level of investment related borrowing and lower borrowing rates. Sales Results and Account Values The following table shows the changes in the account values and net sales of Retirement segment products for the periods indicated. Net sales are total sales minus withdrawals or withdrawals and benefits, as applicable. As noted above under Insurance Division Individual Life and Annuities Sales Results and Account Values, neither sales nor net sales are revenues under GAAP. Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (in millions) Defined Contribution: Beginning total account value $ 24,640 $ 26,046 $ 25,788 Sales 3,858 3,689 5,439 Withdrawals (3,248 ) (3,422 ) (3,937 ) Change in market value, interest credited and other activity(1) (2,336 ) (1,673 ) (1,244 ) Ending total account value $ 22,914 $ 24,640 $ 26,046 Net sales $ 610 $ 267 $ 1,502 Guaranteed Products(2): Beginning total account value $ 39,825 $ 41,577 $ 41,757 Sales 1,467 2,299 2,024 Withdrawals and benefits (3,590 ) (4,372 ) (5,279 ) Change in market value and interest income 2,166 2,198 2,997 Other(3) (810 ) (1,877 ) 78 Ending total account value $ 39,058 $ 39,825 $ 41,577 Net sales $ (2,123 ) $ (2,073 ) $ (3,255 ) (1) The year ended December 31, 2002 includes increases to account values of $360 million added to customer accounts due to Common Stock received as demutualization consideration and increases to account values of $448 million added to customer accounts from inclusion of amounts not previously reflected in this segment. The year ended December 31, 2001 includes increases to account values of $433 million added to customer accounts due to Common Stock received as demutualization consideration. (2) Prudentials retirement plan accounted for 32%, 29% and 27% of sales for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This sales activity predominantly represents repricing of scheduled maturities. These scheduled maturities are also reflected in withdrawals and therefore have no impact on net sales. Ending total account value includes assets of Prudentials retirement plan of $8.5 billion, $9.1 billion and $8.2 billion at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 108 Table of Contents (3) Represents changes in asset balances for externally managed accounts. The year ended December 31, 2001 includes an increase to policyholder account values of $181 million representing cumulative conversions of client balances to products currently included in the business. 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Account values in our full service defined contribution business amounted to $22.9 billion at December 31, 2002, a decrease of $1.7 billion, or 7%, from December 31, 2001. The decrease came primarily from a decline in market value of mutual funds reflecting the general downturn of the equity markets. This decline was partially offset by net sales of $610 million and $808 million added to customer accounts from inclusion of amounts not previously reflected in this segment and Common Stock received as demutualization consideration. Account values for guaranteed products amounted to $39.1 billion at December 31, 2002, a decrease of $767 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2001. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Account values in our full service defined contribution business amounted to $24.6 billion at December 31, 2001, a decrease of $1.4 billion, or 5%, from December 31, 2000. This decrease is primarily due to a decline in market value of mutual funds reflecting the general downturn in the equity markets. In addition, net sales decreased $1.2 billion in 2001 from 2000, reflecting a decrease in new institutional clients. Account values for guaranteed products amounted to $39.8 billion at December 31, 2001, a decrease of $1.8 billion, or 4%, from December 31, 2000. The decrease from December 31, 2000 is primarily due to a decrease in separate account annuity assets that reflected approximately $1.4 billion of annuity benefits. Other Asset Management Operating Results The following table sets forth the Other Asset Management segments operating results for the periods indicated. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, there was no activity that resulted in items excluded from adjusted operating income. Therefore, results of this segment were the same on both an adjusted operating income basis and a GAAP basis. Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (in millions) Operating results: Revenues $ 90 $ 105 $ 66 Expenses 45 50 24 Adjusted operating income $ 45 $ 55 $ 42 Adjusted Operating Income 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Adjusted operating income decreased $10 million from $55 million in 2001 to $45 million in 2002. Increases in adjusted operating income from our commercial mortgage securitization operation and proprietary investment and syndication activities were more than offset by a decline in the adjusted operating income of our hedge portfolios, which were significantly reduced in size during 2002 and held assets of $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2002. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Adjusted operating income increased $13 million, from $42 million in 2000 to $55 million in 2001. The increase came primarily from our commercial mortgage securitization operations, which benefited from changes in market value of financial instruments held pending securitizations. As of December 31, 2001, the hedge portfolios held assets, including both principal positions and securities financing positions, of approximately $3.9 billion, compared to $7.9 billion at December 31, 2000. 109 Table of Contents Revenues 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Revenues, as shown in the table above under Operating Results, decreased $15 million, from $105 million in 2001 to $90 million in 2002. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in our hedge portfolios partially offset by an increase in revenue associated with our proprietary investment and syndication activities. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Revenues increased $39 million, from $66 million in 2000 to $105 million in 2001. The increase in revenue was due primarily to a $21 million increase in revenue associated with our commercial mortgage securitization operations, which benefited from a change in market value of financial instruments held pending securitizations. Additionally, our results for 2001 included $15 million in revenues associated with our proprietary investment and syndication activities. Expenses 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Expenses, as shown in the table above under Operating Results, decreased $5 million, from $50 million in 2001 to $45 million in 2002. The decrease in expenses was due to lower origination and underwriting expenses associated with our commercial mortgage securitization operations resulting from lower production, and lower expenses associated with our hedge portfolios. These expense reductions were partially offset by higher expenses related to our proprietary investment and syndication activities. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Expenses increased $26 million, from $24 million in 2000 to $50 million in 2001. The increase was due to $19 million in expenses associated with our proprietary investment and syndication activities and a $7 million increase in expenses associated with our commercial mortgage securitization operations. International Insurance and Investments Division International Insurance Our international insurance operations are subject to currency fluctuations that can materially affect the U.S. dollar results of our international insurance operations from period to period even if results on a local currency basis are relatively constant. Exchange rates fluctuated significantly in the three years ended December 31, 2002. The financial results of our International Insurance segment reflect the impact of forward currency transactions and internal hedges, whereby some currency fluctuation exposure is assumed in our Corporate and Other operations. These hedging transactions increased international insurance revenues by $32 million in 2002, $45 million in 2001, and $19 million in 2000. An integral element in the management of this exposure is the execution by Corporate and Other operations of forward currency transactions with independent counterparties. Unless otherwise stated, we have translated all information in this section, including the impact of the aforementioned currency hedging transactions, on the basis of actual exchange rates for the years indicated. To achieve a better understanding of local operating performance, where indicated below, we analyze results both on the basis of translated results based on actual exchange rates and on the basis of local results translated at a constant exchange rate. When we discuss constant exchange rate information below, we translated on the basis of the average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2002. 110 Table of Contents Operating Results The following table sets forth the International Insurance segments operating results for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (in millions) Operating results: Revenues(1): International Insurance, excluding Gibraltar Life $ 2,379 $ 2,120 $ 1,920 Gibraltar Life 2,694 2,026 5,073 4,146 1,920 Benefits and expenses: International Insurance, excluding Gibraltar Life 2,000 1,771 1,624 Gibraltar Life(2) 2,316 1,764 4,316 3,535 1,624 Adjusted operating income 757 611 296 Realized investment gains (losses), net, excluding Gibraltar Life 5 (32 ) (15 ) Realized investment losses, net, and related charges, Gibraltar Life (178 ) (25 ) (173 ) (57 ) (15 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 584 $ 554 $ 281 (1) Revenues, excluding Gibraltar Life, exclude realized investment gains (losses), net, of $5 million, $(32) million, and $(15) million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. Revenues for Gibraltar Life exclude realized investment gains (losses), net, of $(162) million and $(25) million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. (2) Benefits and expenses for Gibraltar Life for the year ended December 31, 2002 exclude the portion of net realized investment gains required to be paid as dividends to policyholders of $16 million. Gibraltar Life had no such activity for the year ended December 31, 2001. Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased $30 million, from $554 million in 2001 to $584 million in 2002. This increase reflects a $146 million increase in adjusted operating income, from $611 million in 2001 to $757 million in 2002, as discussed below, partially offset by a $116 million increase in realized investment losses, net, and related charges, from $57 million in 2001 to $173 million in 2002. For a discussion of realized investment losses, net, and related charges see Consolidated Results of Operations Realized Investment Gains. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Income continuing operations before income taxes increased $273 million, from $281 million in 2000 to $554 million in 2001. This increase reflects a $315 million increase in adjusted operating income, from $296 million in 2000 to $611 million in 2001, as discussed below, partially offset by a $42 million increase in realized investment losses, net, and related charges, from $15 million in 2000 to $57 million in 2001. Adjusted Operating Income 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Adjusted operating income increased $146 million from 2001 to 2002, including a $116 million greater contribution from Gibraltar Life for which the year 2001 includes only its initial eight months of reported results, from the April 2, 2001 date of its reorganization through November 30, 2001. Adjusted operating income for Gibraltar Life increased $116 million from $262 million for the initial eight months of operations in 2001, which included a $56 million gain from policy surrenders associated with the initial period of operations after restructuring, to $378 million for 2002. Gibraltar Lifes adjusted operating income of $378 million for 2002 reflects charges from refinements of estimates, primarily of amounts due to 111 Table of Contents policyholders, and lower surrender gains due to more favorable persistency. The impact of these items was offset primarily by favorable mortality experience and a decrease in the estimated liability for guaranty fund assessments. Gibraltar Lifes $378 million adjusted operating income reported for 2002 reflected revenues of $2.694 billion and benefits and expenses of $2.316 billion, which included expenses of approximately $25 million related to the refinements of estimates noted above, which considered Gibraltar Lifes first full year of operations following its reorganization. Gibraltar Lifes revenues were comprised primarily of $2.150 billion of premiums and policy charges and fees, and $500 million of net investment income. Benefits and expenses were comprised of $1.629 billion of policyholders benefits, including changes in reserves, $89 million in interest credited to policyholders account balances, $101 million in dividends to policyholders and $497 million of general and administrative expenses, including distribution costs. As a result of Gibraltar Lifes emergence from reorganization proceedings in April of 2001 and the reduction in benefits for in force policies, when we established Gibraltar Lifes initial liability for future policy benefits, we assumed a higher than normal level of policy surrenders for the near term. Our surrender rate assumptions commencing at the date of reorganization were 6% in the first year and 4% thereafter for paid up policies and range from 2% to 38% in the first year, 3% to 14% in the second year, and 6% to 10% thereafter for premium paying policies. Gibraltar Lifes adjusted operating income included in our results for 2002 was reduced by $21 million from the deviation of policy surrenders from our initial assumptions. In addition, Gibraltar Lifes results for 2002 reflect favorable mortality, as well as improved investment results reflecting the transition from short term investments held during the initial period following the reorganization due to anticipated surrender activity to longer term investments consistent with our asset liability management strategies. Adjusted operating income, excluding the impact of the Gibraltar Life acquisition discussed above, increased $30 million from $349 million in 2001 to $379 million in 2002. The increase came from improved results both from our Japanese insurance operation and our operations in countries other than Japan. Adjusted operating income from our Japanese insurance operation increased $7 million, from $335 million in 2001 to $342 million in 2002. The contribution from continued growth of our existing Japanese insurance operation was partially offset in 2002 by a $19 million negative impact of currency fluctuations, including the impact of our currency hedging, and a loss from the termination of a large case that provided individual life insurance coverage to multiple employees of an organization. Our adjusted operating income from operations in countries other than Japan increased $23 million, from $14 million in 2001 to $37 million in 2002, as increased profits from our operation in Korea, reflecting strong sales and continued favorable persistency, offset continued costs of expansion into other countries and the $8 million benefit to results of the year ago period from a refinement in the methodology used to calculate reserves in our Korean operation. Excluding the impact of the currency fluctuations, our international insurance operations other than Gibraltar Life would have had a 20% increase in adjusted operating income over the prior year. The segments increase in adjusted operating income includes the effect of year over year fluctuations in currency exchange rates as well as the impact of our hedging at expected exchange rates. On a constant exchange rate basis and excluding the impact of currency hedging, adjusted operating income, including results of Gibraltar Life, increased $165 million. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Adjusted operating income increased $315 million from 2000 to 2001. Results of Gibraltar Life, which we include in our results from April 2, 2001, the date of its reorganization, through November 30, 2001, contributed $262 million to the increase in adjusted operating income. The International Insurance segment reported adjusted operating income of $172 million for the fourth quarter of 2001, including $77 million from Gibraltar Life. The $262 million adjusted operating income reported by Gibraltar Life reflected revenues of $2.026 billion and benefits and expenses of $1.764 billion. Gibraltar Lifes revenues were comprised primarily of $1.710 billion of premiums, policy charges and fees, and $304 million net investment income, and its benefits and expenses were comprised primarily of $1.358 billion of policy benefits including changes in reserves, interest credited to policyholders account balances and dividends to policyholders and $406 million of general and administrative expenses. Gibraltar Lifes adjusted operating income for the initial eight month period included in our results 112 Table of Contents benefited from gains on policy surrenders of about $56 million, including about $6 million in the three months ended November 30, 2001. Substantially all of this contribution to adjusted operating income resulted from a high level of surrenders due to customer response to the initial impact of policy changes introduced as part of Gibraltar Lifes reorganization. Adjusted operating income, excluding the impact of the Gibraltar Life acquisition discussed above, increased $53 million, or 18%, from 2000 to 2001. Adjusted operating income for 2001 benefited $8 million from a refinement in the methodology used to calculate reserves in our Korean operations. Excluding this item, adjusted operating income increased $45 million, or 15%. The increase came from improved results both from our operations in countries other than Japan and our Japanese insurance operations. Our operations in countries other than Japan contributed adjusted operating income of $6 million for 2001, excluding the reserve refinement, compared to an operating loss of $19 million for 2000, as increased profits from our operations in Korea and Taiwan more than offset continued costs associated with our expansion into additional countries. Our Japanese insurance operations reported continuing improved results, with adjusted operating income of $335 million in 2001 compared to $315 million in 2000, due to strong persistency and new sales, partially offset by a negative impact of about $24 million from currency fluctuations and less favorable mortality experience. The segments increase in adjusted operating income includes the unfavorable effect of year over year fluctuations in currency exchange rates as well as the impact of our hedging at expected exchange rates. On a constant exchange rate basis and excluding the impact of currency hedging, adjusted operating income, including results of Gibraltar Life, increased $323 million. Revenues 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Revenues, as shown in the table above under Operating Results, increased $927 million from $4.146 billion in 2001 to $5.073 billion in 2002, including a $668 million increase from Gibraltar Life. Excluding the impact of Gibraltar Life, revenues increased $259 million, or 12%, from $2.120 billion in 2001 to $2.379 billion in 2002. The $259 million increase in revenues came primarily from an increase in premium revenue of $251 million, or 14%, from $1.832 billion in 2001 to $2.083 billion in 2002. Premiums from our Korean operation increased $154 million, from $285 million in 2001 to $439 million in 2002, and premiums in our Japanese operation other than Gibraltar Life increased $75 million primarily the result of strong persistency and new sales partially offset by the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Premium revenue in all other countries increased $22 million from 2001 to 2002. On a constant exchange rate basis and excluding the impact of currency hedging, total segment revenues increased $1.041 billion, or 26%, from 2001 to 2002, for which the year ago period includes the initial eight months of activity of Gibraltar Life. Excluding Gibraltar Life, total segment revenues on a constant exchange rate basis and excluding the impact of currency hedging increased $334 million, or 16 %. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Revenues increased $2.226 billion from 2000 to 2001, including $2.026 billion from Gibraltar Life. Excluding the impact of the Gibraltar Life acquisition, revenues increased $200 million, or 10%, from 2000 to 2001. The $200 million increase in revenues came primarily from an increase in premium revenue of $152 million, or 9%, from $1.680 billion in 2000 to $1.832 billion in 2001. Premiums from our Korean operations increased $97 million, from $188 million in 2000 to $285 million in 2001, as a result of increased sales and strong persistency. Premium revenue in all other countries increased $55 million, from $1.492 billion in 2000 to $1.547 billion in 2001, primarily as a result of continued strong persistency and new sales in Japan and Taiwan. On a constant exchange rate basis and excluding the impact of currency hedging, total segment revenues increased $2.369 billion, from 2000 to 2001. Benefits and Expenses 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under Operating Results, increased $781 million from $3.535 billion in 2001 to $4.316 billion in 2002, including a $552 million increase from Gibraltar Life. Excluding the impact of the Gibraltar Life acquisition, benefits and expenses increased $229 million, or 13%, from $1.771 billion in 2001 to $2.000 billion in 2002. The $229 million increase in benefits and expenses came primarily from an increase of $164 million in policyholders benefits, which includes the change in reserves for future policy benefits, and an increase of $56 million in amortization of 113 Table of Contents deferred policy acquisition costs. Policyholders benefits increased from $1.382 billion in 2001 to $1.546 billion in 2002. The increase reflected a greater volume of business in force, which was driven by new sales, continued strong persistency and the aging of business in force in markets where our operations are more mature, partially offset by the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. On a constant exchange rate basis, total segment benefits and expenses increased $876 million. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Benefits and expenses increased $1.911 billion from 2000 to 2001, including $1.764 billion from Gibraltar Life. Excluding the impact of the Gibraltar Life acquisition, benefits and expenses increased $147 million, or 9%, from 2000 to 2001. The $147 million increase in benefits and expenses came primarily from an increase of $120 million in policyholders benefits, which includes the change in reserves for future policy benefits. Policyholders benefits increased from $1.268 billion in 2000 to $1.388 billion in 2001, primarily as a result of the greater volume of business in force, which was driven by new sales, continued strong persistency and the aging of business in force in markets where our operations are more mature. On a constant exchange rate basis, total segment benefits and expenses increased $2.046 billion. Sales Results In managing our international insurance business, we analyze new annualized premiums, which do not correspond to revenues under GAAP, as well as revenues, because new annualized premiums measure the current sales performance of the business unit, while revenues reflect the renewal persistency and aging of in force policies written in prior years and net investment income in addition to current sales. 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. New annualized premiums increased $51 million from $692 million in 2001 to $743 million in 2002, including an increase of $123 million from Gibraltar Life and reflecting the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. On a constant exchange rate basis, new annualized premiums increased $65 million from 2001 to 2002, including an increase of $127 million from Gibraltar Life. On that basis, new annualized premiums from our operation in Japan were $541 million in 2002, including $234 million from Gibraltar Life, compared to $467 million in 2001 when Gibraltar Lifes sales force sold policies for our existing Japanese insurance operation during a portion of the year, pending the completion of Gibraltar Lifes reorganization. Since the first quarter of 2001, the Gibraltar Life sales force has distributed only Gibraltar Life products. Sales in Japan during 2001 were particularly strong due to anticipated premium rate increases that took effect on April 1, 2001 and October 1, 2001. Sales in all other countries, also on a constant exchange rate basis, decreased $9 million as a result of a decrease from our operations in Taiwan and Korea, where 2002 sales were affected by premium rate increases in 2001. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. New annualized premiums increased $183 million, or 36%, from $509 million in 2000 to $692 million in 2001, including $110 million from Gibraltar Life and reflecting the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. On a constant exchange rate basis, new annualized premiums increased $237 million, or 54%, from 2000 to 2001, including $107 million from Gibraltar Life. On that basis, new annualized premiums from our operations other than Gibraltar Life increased $130 million, or 29%. The $130 million increase included $51 million from our existing operation in Japan, reflecting an increase in the number of Life Planners from 1,811 at December 31, 2000 to 1,992 at December 31, 2001 as well as $25 million of new annualized premiums sold by the Gibraltar Life sales force for our existing operation prior to the acquisition date. After that date, the Gibraltar Life sales force has distributed only Gibraltar products. For all countries other than Japan, also on a constant exchange rate basis, new annualized premiums increased $79 million, or 59%, with $78 million of the increase coming from our operations in Korea and Taiwan. The increase in countries other than Japan reflects an increase in the number of Life Planners, from 1,684 at December 31, 2000 to 2,112 at December 31, 2001, as well as an increase in Life Planner productivity. Investment Margins and Other Profitability Factors Many of our insurance products sold in international markets provide for the buildup of cash values for the policyholder at mandated guaranteed interest rates. The spread between the actual investment returns and these guaranteed rates of return to the policyholder is an element of the profit or loss that we will experience on these products. Interest rates guaranteed in our Japanese insurance contracts are regulated by Japanese authorities. Between July 1, 1996 and April 1, 1999, we guaranteed premium rates using an interest rate of 3.1% on most of 114 Table of Contents the products we sold even though the yield on Japanese government and high quality corporate bonds was less than that much of this time. This resulted in some negative investment spreads over this period. As a consequence, our profitability with respect to these products in Japan during that period resulted primarily from margins on mortality, morbidity and expense charges. In response to the low interest rate environment, Japanese regulators approved a reduction in the required rates for most of the products we sell to 2.35% in April 1999, which results in our charging higher premiums on new business for the same amount of insurance. While this has also resulted in an improvement in investment spreads, these spreads had a negative impact on adjusted operating income from our Japanese insurance operation other than Gibraltar Life in 2002 and 2001, and the profitability of these products in Japan continues to result primarily from margins on mortality, morbidity, and expense charges. In 2001, Japanese regulators approved further reductions in the required interest rates applicable to most of the products we sell. As a result, we increased premium rates on most of our products sold in Japan when the new rates were implemented, in April 2001 for some products and in October 2001 for other products. Additionally, interest rates on our guaranteed products sold in Korea are regulated by Korean authorities, who approved, in April 2001, a reduction in the required rates for most of the products we sell, allowing us to charge higher premiums on new business for the same amount of insurance. While these actions enhance our ability to set rates commensurate with available investment returns, the major sources of profitability on our products in Korea, as in Japan, are margins on mortality and expense charges rather than investment spreads. We base premiums and cash values in most countries in which we operate on mandated mortality tables. Our mortality experience in the International Insurance segment on an overall basis for 2002 and 2001 was well within our pricing assumptions and below the guaranteed levels reflected in the premiums we charge. International Investments Operating Results The following table sets forth the International Investments segments operating results for the periods indicated. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, there was no activity that resulted in items excluded from adjusted operating income. Therefore, results of this segment were the same on both an adjusted operating income basis and a GAAP basis. Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (in millions) Operating results: Revenues $ 327 $ 303 $ 355 Expenses 337 344 379 Adjusted operating income $ (10 ) $ (41 ) $ (24 ) Adjusted Operating Income 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Our International Investments segment reported a loss, on an adjusted operating income basis, of $10 million for 2002 compared to a loss of $41 million in 2001. The $31 million reduction in the loss reflected earnings from recently acquired units and lower expenses resulting from our earlier actions to reduce the cost structure. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. The International Investments segment reported a loss, on an adjusted operating income basis, of $41 million in 2001 compared to $24 million for 2000 as 2000 results included a $17 million gain from our interest in the conversion of London Stock Exchange and Hong Kong Stock and Futures Exchange seats into listed shares and trading rights in 2000. Additionally, revenue growth was partially offset by expenses associated with the expansion of this developing business. 115 Table of Contents Revenues 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Revenues, as shown in the table above under Operating Results, increased $24 million, from $303 million in 2001 to $327 million in 2002 due primarily to asset management fees and commissions earned by recently acquired units partially offset by lower commission revenues from our futures operations. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Revenues decreased $52 million, or 15%, from 2000 to 2001. The decrease reflects lower commission revenues associated with reduced transaction volume resulting from less active equity markets in comparison to 2000 which benefited from exceptionally active equity markets in the early part of the year partially offset by increased asset management fees and commissions associated with recently acquired units. In addition, revenues for 2000 included the $17 million gain from our interest in the conversion of stock exchange seats as noted above. Expenses 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Expenses, as shown in the table above under Operating Results, decreased $7 million from $344 million in 2001 to $337 million in 2002 primarily due to decreases in revenue based compensation costs and cost saving measures implemented in 2001 partially offset by expenses associated with recently acquired units. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Expenses decreased $35 million, or 9%, from 2000 to 2001, due primarily to decreases in revenue based compensation costs. In addition, results for 2001 include expenses associated with staff reductions and facilities consolidations. Expenses associated with recently acquired units partially offset the aforementioned expense declines. Corporate and Other Operations Corporate and Other operations include corporate level activities that we do not allocate to our business segments. It also consists of real estate and relocation services, international ventures, divested businesses and businesses that we have placed in wind down status but have not divested. Corporate level activities consist primarily of corporate level income and expenses not allocated to any of our business segments, including costs for company wide initiatives such as enhancement of our Internet capabilities and income from our qualified pension plans, as well as investment returns on capital that is not deployed in any of our segments. Corporate level activities also include returns from investments that we do not allocate to any of our business segments, including a debt financed investment portfolio, which was substantially reduced in 2001 and the remainder liquidated in 2002, and transactions with other segments. Corporate level activities also include certain obligations retained at the corporate level relating to policyholders whom we had previously agreed to provide insurance for reduced or no premium, in accordance with contractual settlements related to prior sales practices remediation. Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (in millions) Adjusted operating income: Corporate level activities(1) $ 155 $ 90 $ (21 ) Other businesses: Real estate and relocation services 46 (11 ) 31 International ventures (2 ) (23 ) (17 ) Other (5 ) 8 50 Adjusted operating income 194 64 43 Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments (92 ) 187 (280 ) Sales practices remedies and costs (20 ) Divested businesses (80 ) (147 ) (636 ) Demutualization costs and expenses (588 ) (143 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes $ 2 $ (484 ) $ (1,016 ) (1) Includes consolidating adjustments. 116 Table of Contents 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $2 million in 2002, compared to a loss of $484 million in 2001 as the 2001 period included $588 million of demutualization costs and expenses as discussed in Consolidated Results of Operations Demutualization Costs and Expenses. Additionally, adjusted operating income increased $130 million, from $64 million in 2001 to $194 million in 2002 as discussed below. In addition, losses from divested businesses declined $67 million, from $147 million in 2001 to $80 million in 2002 as discussed in Consolidated Results of Operations Divested Businesses. The aforementioned improvements were partially offset by a $279 million decline in realized investment gains, net, and related adjustments, from realized investment gains of $187 million in 2001 to losses of $92 million in 2002, as discussed in Consolidated Results of Operations Realized Investment Gains, and a $20 million charge in 2002 for sales practices remedies and costs as discussed in Consolidated Results of Operations Sales Practices Remedies and Costs. Corporate and Other operations resulted in adjusted operating income of $194 million in 2002 and $64 million in 2001, an increase of $130 million. Corporate level activities resulted in adjusted operating income of $155 million in 2002 and $90 million in 2001. The increase was primarily due to higher investment income, net of interest expense, of $50 million. Corporate level activities benefited from the impact of the transfer of net assets from the Traditional Participating Products segment at the date of our demutualization and from cash and short term investments held at the parent company, which together contributed $229 million to current period adjusted operating income. This additional investment income was offset by lower returns from joint venture and limited partnership investments and reduced investment income, net of interest expense, from the wind down of a debt financed portfolio and lower yields on corporate level invested assets. Corporate level general and administrative expenses were $576 million in 2002, before qualified pension income, compared to $671 million in 2001. Lower expenses, reflecting in part the impact of previous expense reduction initiatives, more than offset expenses incurred in the 2002 period associated with servicing our stockholder base and expenses associated with the implementation of our organizational changes announced in August 2002. Income from our own qualified pension plan amounted to $502 million in 2002, compared to $540 million in 2001. The $38 million decline reflects changes in pension plan assumptions, primarily a decrease in the discount rate from 7.75% to 7.25%. For purposes of calculating pension income from our own qualified pension plan for the year ended December 31, 2003, we will apply an expected return on plan assets of 8.75%, compared to 9.50% used in 2002, and a discount rate of 6.50%, compared to 7.25% in 2002. We determined our expected return on plan assets based upon the arithmetic average of prospective returns, based upon independent third party studies, for equity, debt and real estate markets applied on a weighted average basis to our pension asset portfolio. The decrease in expected rate of return on pension plan assets for 2003 reflects the impact of current market conditions on our prospective view for equity, debt and real estate returns, while the decrease in the discount rate reflects the impact of current market conditions. We will continue to apply a 4.50% rate of increase in compensation levels for purposes of these calculations. Giving effect to the foregoing assumptions for purposes of pension calculations, we expect that income from our own qualified pension plan will continue to contribute to adjusted operating income in 2003 at a level of about $120 million to $140 million below that of the year ended December 31, 2002. Our assumption for return on plan assets for 2003 of 8.75 % has been established as of the September 30, 2002 plan valuation for purposes of results for the year 2003 and will not change with respect to 2003 results. Had a different rate been established for 2003 we estimate that each 1% change, either upward or downward, would have resulted in a corresponding increase or decrease of $95 to $100 million in the expected contribution from our own qualified pension plan to adjusted operating income, if all other assumptions were applied without change. Corporate level activities in 2002 includes expenses of $96 million related to supplemental benefits paid to policyholders whom we had previously agreed to provide insurance for reduced or no premium in accordance with contractual settlements related to prior sales practices remediation. This expense resulted from the securities market downturn in 2002, as well as the reduction in policyholder dividend scale announced in December 2002, 117 Table of Contents as we incur a cost to the extent existing account balances are not adequate to cover the cost of the reduced premiums. These expenses were partially offset by a $26 million reduction, in 2002, of a liability we established in 2001 for death and other benefits due with respect to policies for which we had not received a death claim but where death has occurred, due to a change in our estimate. In 2001 Corporate level activities included a $20 million charge offsetting the income earned by Prudential Securities as co manager in the initial public offering of our Common Stock, which is included in adjusted operating income of our Financial Advisory segment. Other businesses included in Corporate and Other operations resulted in adjusted operating income of $39 million in 2002, as compared to a loss, on an adjusted operating income basis, of $26 million in 2001. The improvement relates primarily to our real estate and relocation business, which reported adjusted operating income of $46 million in 2002 compared to a loss, on an adjusted operating income basis, of $11 million in 2001. The loss in 2001 reflected expenses of $35 million incurred by this business to consolidate its operating facilities, while 2002 results benefited from increased transaction volume, lower expense levels and activities of a subsidiary acquired in the fourth quarter of 2001. In addition, losses from the remaining operations included in other businesses decreased $8 million, on an adjusted operating income basis, from $15 million in 2001 to $7 million in 2002, primarily reflecting the write off of goodwill in our international ventures unit in 2001. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Corporate and Other operations resulted in a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $484 million in 2001, representing a $532 million decrease in the loss from $1.016 billion in 2000. The $532 million decrease in the loss was the primarily the result of a $489 million decline in losses from divested businesses, from $636 million in 2000 to $147 million in 2001 and a decline in realized investment losses, net, and related adjustments from $280 million in 2000 to gains of $187 million in 2001. Additionally, adjusted operating income increased $21 million, from $43 million in 2000 to $64 million in 2001. However, these improvements were partially offset by a $445 million increase in demutualization costs and expenses, from $143 million in 2000 to $588 million in 2001. Corporate and Other operations resulted in adjusted operating income of $64 million in 2001 and $43 million in 2000, an increase of $21 million. Corporate level activities resulted in adjusted operating income of $90 million in 2001 and a $21 million loss, on an adjusted operating income basis, in 2000. The $111 million increase came primarily from $125 million greater income from our own qualified pension plan and a $22 million reduction in hedging losses retained at the corporate level, partially offset by reduced investment income and a $20 million charge offsetting the income earned by Prudential Securities as co manager in the initial public offering of our Common Stock, which is included in adjusted operating income of our Financial Advisory segment. Income from our own qualified pension plan amounted to $540 million in 2001, compared to $415 million in 2000. The $125 million increase came primarily from increased income on pension assets and amortization of deferred gains. Hedging losses retained at the corporate level decreased $22 million from $26 million in 2000 to $4 million in 2001. The increase in income from our own qualified pension plan and decrease in hedging losses were partially offset by reductions in investment income from our debt financed investment portfolio and from invested assets that we held pending disbursement for sales practices remedies and costs. Investment income from the debt financed investment portfolio, net of interest expense, contributed $38 million to adjusted operating income for 2001 compared to $98 million for 2000, as a result of a decline in the assets in the portfolio to approximately $223 million at December 31, 2001 from $3.7 billion a year earlier. Income from invested assets related to sales practices remedies and costs declined $25 million as disbursements were made to satisfy these liabilities. Investment income for 2001 included about $15 million relating to assets initially invested within our Corporate and Other operations as a result of transactions relating to our demutualization, effective as of December 18, 2001. About half of this investment income represents earning on assets corresponding to cash payments in January 2002 for demutualization consideration in lieu of Common Stock. General and administrative expenses at the corporate level, on a gross basis before qualified pension income, amounted to $671 million in 2001 compared to $687 million in 2000. 118 Table of Contents Other businesses included in Corporate and Other operations resulted in a loss, on an adjusted operating income basis of $26 million in 2001 compared to income of $64 million in 2000. The $90 million decline came primarily from the benefit to 2000 results from reductions of reserves for future claims in our remaining Canadian insurance operations and our wind down group credit insurance operations. In addition, our real estate and relocation business reported a loss, on an adjusted operating income basis, of $11 million in 2001 versus adjusted operating income of $31 million in 2000. The loss in 2001 resulted from expenses of $35 million from consolidation of operating facilities as well as a decline in corporate relocation volume. Closed Block Business As discussed under Overview Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Business, we established the Closed Block Business effective at the date of demutualization. The Closed Block Business, which represents results of our former Traditional Participating Products segment prior to the demutualization, includes our in force traditional participating life insurance and annuity products, and assets that are being used for the payment of benefits and policyholder dividends on these policies, as well as other assets and equity and related liabilities that support these policies. We have ceased offering these participating policies. Also concurrently with our demutualization, we issued the IHC debt. We allocated the majority of the net proceeds from the issuance of the IHC debt to the Financial Services Businesses. However, we expect that the IHC debt will be serviced by the net cash flows of the Closed Block Business over time, and results of the Closed Block Business include interest expense associated with the IHC debt. Upon the establishment of the Closed Block Business, we transferred $5.6 billion of net assets previously associated with the former Traditional Participating Products segment to the Financial Services Businesses. As a result, income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes of the Closed Block Business excludes returns on these net assets, which were historically included in income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes of the former Traditional Participating Products segment. At the end of each year, the Board of Directors of Prudential Insurance determines the dividends payable for participating policies for the following year based on its statutory results and past experience, including investment income, net realized gains over a number of years, mortality experience and other factors. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, we developed an actuarial calculation of the timing of the maximum future earnings from the policies included in the Closed Block, and if actual cumulative earnings in any given period are greater than the cumulative earnings we expect, we will record this excess as a policyholder dividend obligation. We will subsequently pay this excess to Closed Block policyholders as an additional dividend unless it is otherwise offset by future Closed Block performance that is less favorable than what we originally expected. The policyholder dividends we charge to expense within the Closed Block Business will include any policyholder dividend obligations that we recognize for the excess of actual cumulative earnings in any given period over the cumulative earnings we expect in addition to the actual policyholder dividends declared by the Board of Directors of Prudential Insurance. If cumulative performance is less favorable than we expected, the policyholder dividends we charge to expense within the Closed Block Business will be the actual dividends declared by the Board of Directors. Subsequent to the date of demutualization, there was no required charge to recognize a policyholder dividend obligation for the excess of actual cumulative earnings in any given period over the cumulative earnings we expect. However, unrealized investment gains and losses that have arisen subsequent to the establishment of the Closed Block have been reflected as a policyholder dividend obligation to be paid to Closed Block policyholders, unless otherwise offset by future experience, with an offsetting amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income and, as such, we have a policyholder dividend obligation to be paid to Closed Block policyholders of $1.605 billion recorded as of December 31, 2002. 119 Table of Contents Operating Results Management does not consider adjusted operating income to assess operating performance of the Closed Block Business. Consequently, results of the Closed Block Business for all periods are presented only in accordance with GAAP. The following table sets forth the Closed Block Businesss GAAP results for the periods indicated. Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (in millions) GAAP results: Revenues $ 7,121 $ 7,728 $ 8,729 Benefits and expenses 7,878 8,347 8,536 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes $ (757 ) $ (619 ) $ 193 Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Loss from continuing operations before income taxes increased $138 million, to $757 million for 2002 from $619 million in 2001. The increase in the loss from continuing operations before income taxes reflects a decline in net investment income, including interest expense on the IHC debt, of $402 million. This decline reflects our transfer of $5.6 billion of net assets previously associated with the former Traditional Participating Products segment at the date of our demutualization in late 2001 and a lower investment yield on the assets remaining in the Closed Block Business, as well as interest expense associated with the IHC debt, which we issued in December 2001. Partially offsetting these items was a decrease in the charge for policyholder dividends of $127 million, reflecting changes in the dividend scale for 2002 and 2003. In addition, we established $144 million of reserves in 2001 for death and other benefits due with respect to policies for which we had not received a death claim but where death has occurred. Lastly, we continue to benefit from our expense reduction efforts, for which the Closed Block Business incurred $48 million of implementation costs in 2001. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Income from continuing operations before income taxes amounted to a loss of $619 million in 2001, compared to income of $193 million in 2000, with the decline primarily due to a $634 million decrease in realized investment gains (losses), net. For a discussion of Closed Block Business realized investment losses, net, see Consolidated Results of Operations Realized Investment Gains. Revenues 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Revenues, as shown in the table above under Operating Results, decreased $607 million, or 8%, from 2001 to 2002. Net investment income declined $279 million, from $3.897 billion in 2001 to $3.618 billion in 2002, for the reasons discussed above. Premiums decreased $228 million, or 5%, from $4.250 billion in 2001 to $4.022 billion in 2002, reflecting a decline in first year and renewal premiums as well as paid up additions, which represent additional insurance purchased with policyholder dividends. We discontinued sales of traditional products in connection with our demutualization and expect the decline in first year and renewal premiums to continue as the policies in force mature or terminate over time. The decline in paid up additions is consistent with the decrease in the dividend scales discussed above. Realized investment losses, net of gains, increased $44 million, from $543 million in 2001 to $587 million in 2002. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Revenues decreased $1.001 billion, or 11%, from 2000 to 2001. Realized investment gains (losses), net decreased $634 million, as discussed above. Premiums decreased $105 million, from $4.355 billion in 2000 to $4.250 billion in 2001, as an increase in paid up additions, which represent additional insurance purchased with policyholder dividends, was more than offset by lower renewal premiums. Net investment income decreased $275 million, from $4.172 billion in 2000 to $3.897 billion in 2001, reflecting a decline in the general account invested assets supporting this business due to a lower level of borrowing activity and a lower investment yield. 120 Table of Contents Benefits and Expenses 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. Benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under Operating Results, decreased $469 million, or 6%, from 2001 to 2002. Operating expenses, including distribution costs that we charge to expense, decreased $136 million, from 2001 to 2002, reflecting our continued efforts to reduce operating cost levels and $48 million of implementation costs for this program incurred by the Closed Block Business in 2001. An increase in interest expense associated with the IHC debt we issued in December 2001, was a partial offset. Policyholder benefits and related changes in reserves, including interest credited to policyholders accounts, decreased $278 million, from $4.722 billion in 2001 to $4.444 billion in 2002. Policyholder benefits for 2001 included $144 million of reserves established for death and other benefits due with respect to policies for which we had not received a death claim but where death has occurred. Reserves established for new and renewal business decreased in 2002, consistent with our expectations and reflecting our discontinuation of sales of traditional products discussed above, partially offset by growth in reserves due to aging of policies in force. Dividends to policyholders amounted to $2.506 billion in 2002, a decrease of $127 million, or 5%, from $2.633 billion in 2001. The decline reflects reductions in the dividend scales for 2002 and 2003 based on evaluations of the experience underlying the dividend scale. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. Benefits and expenses decreased $189 million, or 2%, from 2000 to 2001. Interest expense declined $118 million, from $152 million in 2000 to $34 million in 2001, primarily due to a lower level of borrowing activity associated with the decrease in investment income. Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs decreased $56 million, from $269 million in 2000 to $213 million in 2001, as these costs became fully amortized on a portion of this business. Operating expenses, including distribution costs that we charge to expense, decreased $26 million, from $771 million in 2000 to $745 million in 2001, as a result of efforts to reduce operating cost levels. Policyholder benefits and related changes in reserves, including interest credited to policyholders accounts, increased $84 million, from $4.638 billion in 2000 to $4.722 billion in 2001. The increase in benefits and reserves resulted from death benefits, including $138 million of reserves recorded in 2001 for death and other benefits due with respect to policies for which we had not received a death claim but where death has occurred, and the aging of policies in force, as well as insurance claims relating to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the U.S., which resulted in net losses of approximately $10 million. Partially offsetting these items is a reduction in the amount of reserves established for new and renewal business. Dividends to policyholders amounted to $2.633 billion in 2001, a decrease of $73 million from $2.706 billion in 2000. There was no adjustment to the dividend scale in 2001 from the scale of 2000. The decrease relates to the portion of our dividend provision related to dividends for the subsequent year and reflects dividend scale changes for 2002 based on evaluation of the experience underlying the dividend scale. Sales Results New statutory premiums from sales of traditional participating individual life insurance products amounted to $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, representing first year premiums on policies we sold prior to our demutualization, $36 million for 2001 and $49 million for 2000. We ceased sales of traditional participating products in connection with our demutualization. 121 Table of Contents Policy Surrender Experience The following table sets forth policy surrender experience for the Closed Block Business, measured by cash value of surrenders, for the periods indicated. These amounts do not correspond to the income statement impact of surrenders under GAAP. In managing this business, we analyze the cash value of surrenders because it is a measure of the degree to which policyholders are maintaining their in force business with us, a driver of future profitability. Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 ($ in millions) Cash value of surrenders $ 1,234 $ 1,246 $ 1,217 Cash value of surrenders as a percentage of mean future policy benefit reserves 2.6 % 2.7 % 2.7 % 2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison. The total cash value of surrenders decreased $12 million in 2002 from 2001, primarily as a result of our efforts during 2001 to locate policyholders in connection with our demutualization. The level of surrenders as a percentage of mean future policy benefit reserves was relatively unchanged in 2002 from 2001. 2001 to 2000 Annual Comparison. The total cash value of surrenders increased $29 million, or 2%, from 2000 to 2001, primarily as a result of our efforts to locate policyholders in connection with our demutualization. The level of surrenders as a percentage of mean future policy benefit reserves was unchanged from 2000 to 2001. Liquidity and Capital Resources Prudential Financial The principal sources of funds available to Prudential Financial, the parent holding company, to meet its obligations, including the payment of shareholder dividends, debt service, capital contributions to subsidiaries and operating expenses, are cash and short term investments, dividends and returns of capital, and interest income from its direct and indirect subsidiaries. These sources of funds are complemented by Prudential Financials capital markets access. We believe that cash flows from these sources are more than adequate to satisfy the liquidity requirements of our operations. As of December 31, 2002, Prudential Financial had cash and short term investments of approximately $1.8 billion, a decrease of $2.6 billion, or 59%, from December 31, 2001. Sources of Cash Sources of cash included dividends and returns of capital of approximately $800 million from several operating businesses as well as approximately $700 million in additional cash received from operating businesses, which includes approximately $450 million in excess cash loaned to Prudential Financial on a short term basis. Uses of Cash In addition to the payment of $2.1 billion for demutualization consideration to eligible policyholders in our 2001 demutualization, uses of cash included capital contributions of $1.3 billion to various operating businesses, as well as $173 million in dividends paid to common shareholders and $726 million utilized to repurchase Common Stock. Prudential Financial remains obligated to disburse further payments of approximately $950 million, representing demutualization consideration for eligible policyholders we were unable to locate. To the extent we are unable to locate these policyholders within a prescribed period of time specified by state escheat laws, typically three to seven years, the funds must be remitted to governmental authorities. Liabilities relating to demutualization consideration payments were established on the date of demutualization. Our insurance, broker dealer and various other companies are subject to regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends and on other transfers of funds to affiliates. With respect to Prudential Insurance, New Jersey insurance law provides that, except in the case of extraordinary dividends or distributions, all dividends or 122 Table of Contents distributions paid by Prudential Insurance may be declared or paid only from unassigned surplus, as determined pursuant to statutory accounting principles, less unrealized investment gains and revaluation of assets. Upon demutualization, unassigned surplus was reduced to zero, thereby limiting Prudential Insurances ability to pay a dividend immediately following demutualization. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, Prudential Insurances unassigned surplus (deficit) was ($420) million and $228 million, respectively, and there were no applicable adjustments for unrealized investment gains or revaluation of assets for purposes of the foregoing law regarding dividends and distributions. Prudential Insurance also must notify the New Jersey insurance regulator of its intent to pay a dividend. If the dividend, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, would exceed a specified statutory limit, Prudential Insurance must also obtain a non disapproval from the New Jersey insurance regulator. The current statutory limitation applicable to New Jersey life insurers generally is the greater of 10% of the prior calendar years statutory surplus or the prior calendar years statutory net gain from operations (excluding realized capital gains). In addition to these regulatory limitations, the terms of the IHC debt also contain restrictions potentially limiting dividends by Prudential Insurance applicable to the Financial Services Businesses in the event the Closed Block Business is in financial distress and other circumstances. In 2002, Prudential Insurance notified the New Jersey insurance regulator of its intent to pay an extraordinary dividend and, upon non disapproval from the regulator, paid an extraordinary dividend of $228 million to Prudential Holdings, LLC. Prudential Holdings, LLC, in turn, paid $169 million of such dividend to Prudential Financial of which $150 million was attributable to the Financial Services Businesses. In addition to the Prudential Insurance dividend, two of our property and casualty subsidiaries, Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance Company of New Jersey and Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance Company, paid extraordinary dividends of $100 million and $60 million, respectively, in 2002. These subsidiaries are subject to regulations similar to those applicable to Prudential Insurance with respect to their ability to pay dividends. The laws regulating dividends of the other states and foreign jurisdictions where our other insurance companies are domiciled are similar, but not identical, to New Jerseys. In addition, the net capital rules to which our broker dealer subsidiaries are subject may limit their ability to pay dividends to Prudential Financial. Pursuant to Gibraltar Lifes reorganization, there are certain restrictions on Gibraltar Lifes ability to pay dividends to Prudential Financial. On January 22, 2002, Prudential Financials Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which Prudential Financial was authorized to purchase up to $1 billion of its outstanding Common Stock. As of December 31, 2002, 26.0 million shares of Common Stock were repurchased by the Company at a total cost of $800 million, including 1.7 million shares at a cost of $56 million that were immediately reissued directly to a Company deferred compensation plan. Between January 1, 2003 and February 28, 2003, the Company repurchased an additional 5.6 million shares at a total cost of $175 million. On March 11, 2003, Prudential Financials Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which Prudential Financial is authorized to purchase up to $1 billion of its outstanding Common Stock. The timing and amount of any repurchases under the authorization will be determined by management based on market conditions and other considerations, and such repurchases may be effected in the open market or through negotiated transactions. On November 12, 2002, the Company declared annual dividends for 2002 of $0.40 per share of Common Stock and $9.625 per share of Class B Stock, each payable on December 18, 2002 to shareholders of record as of November 25, 2002. The total dividends payable amounted to $226 million and $19 million for the Common Stock and Class B Stock, respectively, of which $173 million and $19 million, respectively, were paid out as of December 31, 2002. On December 19, 2002, we entered into a definitive Stock Purchase Agreement with Skandia Insurance Company Ltd. (Skandia), an insurance company based in Sweden, pursuant to which Prudential Financial will acquire Skandia U.S. Inc., a Delaware corporation (Skandia U.S.), from Skandia. The total consideration payable in the transaction includes a cash purchase price of $1.15 billion and the assumption of a $115 million liability, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. The transaction, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2003, is subject to various closing conditions, including, among others, regulatory approvals, filing under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and approval by the boards of directors and shareholders of the mutual funds advised by Skandia U.S.s subsidiaries. We plan to utilize cash and borrowing capacity at Prudential Financial to fund this transaction. 123 Table of Contents On February 19, 2003, we announced an agreement with Wachovia to combine each companys respective retail securities brokerage and clearing operations. This transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2003. The new combined company will require additional capital to finance the cost of merging the businesses. Our share of such funding, excluding related tax benefits, is expected to be approximately $400 million. That need is expected to be partially offset at closing with cash that will be distributed to Prudential Securities Group, Inc. from Prudential Securities, Inc. as the businesses are combined. The transaction is not expected to have a material impact on Prudential Financials liquidity and capital position. Financing Activities Prudential Financial is authorized to borrow funds from various sources to meet its financing needs, as well as the financing needs of its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2002, there was no outstanding third party debt at Prudential Financial. To enhance financial flexibility, we plan to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the second quarter of 2003, which will permit the issuance of public debt and equity securities. In addition, Prudential Funding, LLC (Prudential Funding), a wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Insurance, continues to serve as a source of financing for Prudential Insurance and its subsidiaries, as well as for destacked subsidiaries. Prudential Funding operates under a support agreement with Prudential Insurance, whereby Prudential Insurance has agreed to maintain Prudential Fundings positive tangible net worth at all times. Prudential Funding borrows funds primarily through the direct issuance of commercial paper and private placement medium term notes. Prudential Fundings outstanding loans to destacked subsidiaries are expected to decline over time as it transitions into a financing company primarily for Prudential Insurance and its remaining subsidiaries. We anticipate that our other companies will borrow directly from third parties and from Prudential Financial, as well as from Prudential Funding from time to time. Our current financing activities principally consist of unsecured short term and long term unsecured debt borrowings and asset based or secured forms of financing. These secured financing arrangements include transactions such as securities lending and repurchase agreements, which we generally use to finance liquid securities in our short term spread portfolios. The following table sets forth our outstanding financing as of the dates indicated: As of December 31, 2002 2001 (in millions) Borrowings: General obligation short term debt $ 3,468 $ 5,334 General obligation long term debt: Senior debt 1,744 2,042 Surplus notes 690 989 Total general obligation long term debt 2,434 3,031 Total general obligations 5,902 8,365 Total limited and non recourse borrowing(1) 2,324 2,344 Total borrowings(2) 8,226 10,709 Total asset based financing 29,127 24,683 Total borrowings and asset based financings(3) $ 37,353 $ 35,392 (1) As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, $1.75 billion of limited and non recourse debt is within the Closed Block Business. (2) Includes $1.3 billion and $1.7 billion related to Prudential Securities Group Inc. as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. (3) Includes $8.9 billion and $9.6 billion related to Prudential Securities Group Inc. as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Total general debt obligations as of December 31, 2002 decreased by $2.5 billion, or 29%, from December 31, 2001, reflecting a $597 million decrease in long term debt obligations and a $1.9 billion decrease in short term debt obligations. The decrease in short term debt was driven in part by the recapitalization of Prudential Securities Group net of its increased borrowing needs, which contributed approximately $710 million to the decrease in short term debt. In addition, various other businesses utilized over $540 million in cash from operations to reduce commercial paper outstanding. Also contributing to the decline in short term debt were decreased borrowing needs of approximately $750 million in various operating businesses. Long term debt decreased primarily due to the reclassification of $585 million in long term debt to current, including $300 million in surplus notes. Asset based financing increased by $4.4 billion in our short term spread portfolios. 124 Table of Contents Our total borrowings consist of amounts used for general corporate purposes, investment related debt, securities business related debt and debt related to specified other businesses. Borrowings used for general corporate purposes include those used for cash flow timing mismatches at Prudential Financial and investments in equity and debt securities of subsidiaries including amounts utilized for regulatory capital purposes. Investment related borrowings consist of debt issued to finance specific investment assets or portfolios of investment assets, including institutional spread lending investment portfolios, real estate, and real estate related investments held in consolidated joint ventures, as well as institutional and insurance company portfolio cash flow timing differences. Securities business related debt consists of debt issued to finance primarily the liquidity of our broker dealers and our capital markets and other securities business related operations. Debt related to specified other businesses consists of borrowings associated with consumer banking activities, real estate franchises and relocation services. Borrowings under which either the holder is entitled to collect only against the assets pledged to the debt as collateral, or has only very limited rights to collect against other assets, have been classified as limited and non recourse debt. This amount includes $1.75 billion of limited and non recourse debt within the Closed Block Business. Our borrowings as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, categorized by use of proceeds, are summarized below: As of December 31, 2002 2001 (in millions) General obligations: General corporate purposes $ 1,596 $ 2,667 Investment related 899 1,420 Securities business related 2,614 3,123 Specified other businesses 793 1,155 Total general obligations 5,902 8,365 Limited and non recourse debt 2,324 2,344 Total borrowings $ 8,226 $ 10,709 Long term debt $ 4,757 $ 5,304 Short term debt 3,469 5,405 Total borrowings $ 8,226 $ 10,709 Borrowings of Financial Services Businesses $ 6,476 $ 8,959 Borrowings of Closed Block Business 1,750 1,750 Total borrowings $ 8,226 $ 10,709 Our short term debt includes bank borrowings and commercial paper outstanding under Prudential Fundings domestic commercial paper program as well as borrowings outstanding under an asset backed commercial paper conduit that is described below. Prudential Fundings commercial paper borrowings as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 were $1.3 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. In the second quarter of 2002, Prudential Financial issued a subordinated guarantee covering Prudential Fundings domestic commercial paper program. The weighted average interest rates on the commercial paper borrowings under these programs were 1.26%, 4.22% and 6.31% for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The total principal amount of debt outstanding under Prudential Fundings medium term note programs as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $1.4 billon and $2.0 billion, respectively. The weighted average interest rates on Prudential Fundings long term debt, in the aggregate, were 4.71%, 5.94% and 6.67% for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. As of December 31, 2002, Prudential Financial had no short term or long term debt outstanding. We had outstanding surplus notes totaling $990 million and $989 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These debt securities, which are included as surplus of Prudential Insurance on a statutory accounting basis, are subordinate to other borrowings and to policyholder obligations and are subject to regulatory approvals for principal and interest payments. As of December 31, 2002, Prudential Insurance and Prudential Funding had unsecured committed lines of credit totaling $2.6 billion. The lines consist of $0.1 billion expiring during 2003, $1.0 billion expiring in May 2004, and $1.5 billion expiring in October 2006. Borrowings under the outstanding facilities must mature no later than the respective expiration dates of the facilities. The facility expiring in May 2004 includes 28 financial institutions, many of which are also among the 27 financial institutions participating in the October 2006 facility. Up to $2.0 billion of the $2.6 billion available under these facilities can be utilized by Prudential Financial. The 125 Table of Contents $2.0 billion consists of $1.0 billion made available under each of the facilities expiring in May 2004 and October 2006. We use these facilities primarily as back up liquidity lines for our commercial paper programs, and there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities as of December 31, 2002 or 2001. Our ability to borrow under these facilities is conditioned on our continued satisfaction of customary conditions, including maintenance at all times by Prudential Insurance of total adjusted capital of at least $5.5 billion based on statutory accounting principles prescribed under New Jersey law. Prudential Insurances total adjusted capital as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $9.1 billion and $10.0 billion, respectively. The ability of Prudential Financial to borrow under these facilities is conditioned on its maintenance of consolidated net worth of at least $12.5 billion, based on GAAP. Prudential Financials consolidated net worth totaled $21.3 billion and $20.5 billion as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In addition, we have a credit facility utilizing a third party sponsored, asset backed commercial paper conduit, under which we can borrow up to $500 million. This facility is 100% supported by unsecured committed lines of credit from many of the financial institutions included in our other facilities. Our actual ability to borrow under this facility depends on market conditions, and with respect to the lines of credit, Prudential Financial is subject to the same net worth requirement as with our other facilities. This facility expires in December 2003. We also use uncommitted lines of credit from banks and other financial institutions. Insurance, Annuities and Guaranteed Products Liquidity General Our principal cash flow sources from insurance, annuities and guaranteed products are premiums and annuity considerations, investment and fee income, and investment maturities and sales. We supplement these cash inflows with financing activities. We actively use our balance sheet capacity for financing activities on a secured basis through securities lending, repurchase and dollar roll transactions and on an unsecured basis for temporary cash flow mismatch coverage. Historically, we have also used our balance sheet capacity to earn additional spread income, primarily through our debt financed investment portfolio included in Corporate and Other operations, although this portfolio was substantially reduced in 2001, with the remainder liquidated in 2002. Cash outflow requirements principally relate to benefits, claims, dividends paid to policyholders, and payments to contract holders as well as amounts paid to policyholders and contract holders in connection with surrenders, withdrawals and net policy loan activity. Uses of cash also include commissions, general and administrative expenses, purchases of investments, and debt service and repayments in connection with financing activities. We believe that cash flows from operating and investing activities of our insurance, annuity and guaranteed products operations are adequate to satisfy liquidity requirements of these operations based on our current liability structure and considering a variety of reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios. The continued adequacy of this liquidity will depend upon factors including future securities market conditions, changes in interest rate levels and policyholder perceptions of our financial strength, which could lead to reduced cash inflows or increased cash outflows. Prudential Insurance and Insurance Subsidiaries We manage cash flow at these entities to ensure that all liquidity requirements are satisfied. Some of our products, such as guaranteed products offered to institutional customers of the Retirement segment, provide for payment of accumulated funds to the contract holder at a specified maturity date unless the contract holder elects to roll over the funds into another contract with us. We regularly monitor our liquidity requirements associated with policyholder and contractholder obligations so that we can manage cash inflows to match anticipated cash outflow requirements. Gross account withdrawals for Prudential Insurance and its insurance subsidiaries amounted to $6.608 billion and $7.156 billion for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These withdrawals include contractually scheduled maturities of traditional guaranteed investment contracts totaling $1.064 billion and $1.671 billion in 2002 and 2001, respectively. We experienced these withdrawals on guaranteed products as 126 Table of Contents a result of contractual expirations of products sold in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Since these contractual withdrawals, as well as the level of surrenders experienced, were consistent with our assumptions in asset liability management, the associated cash outflows did not have an adverse impact on our overall liquidity. We use surrender charges and other contract provisions to mitigate the extent, timing and profitability impact of withdrawals of funds by customers from annuity contracts. The following table sets forth withdrawal characteristics of our general account annuity reserves and deposit liabilities (based on statutory liability values) as of the dates indicated. As of December 31, 2002 2001 Amount % of Total Amount % of Total ($ in millions) Not subject to discretionary withdrawal provisions $ 17,566 54 % $ 17,593 57 % Subject to discretionary withdrawal, with adjustment: With market value adjustment 5,282 16 % 4,489 15 % At contract value, less surrender charge of 5% or more 2,065 6 % 1,285 4 % Subtotal 24,913 76 % 23,367 76 % Subject to discretionary withdrawal at contract value with no surrender charge or surrender charge of less than 5% 8,053 24 % 7,239 24 % Total annuity reserves and deposit liabilities $ 32,966 100 % $ 30,606 100 % As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, general account balances for variable life insurance products other than single payment life were $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, Prudential Insurance and its insurance subsidiaries had cash and short term investments of approximately $9.798 billion and $9.496 billion, respectively, and fixed maturity investments classified as available for sale with fair values of $92.8 billion and $79.2 billion at those dates, respectively. Gibraltar Life Insurance Company, Ltd. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, Gibraltar Life, which we acquired in April 2001, had $5.741 billion and $5.881 billion of general account annuity reserves and deposit liabilities that are subject to discretionary withdrawal at their contract value, less a surrender charge of 5% or more. Gibraltar Lifes assets and liabilities were substantially restructured under a reorganization concurrent with our acquisition, which included the imposition of special surrender penalties on existing policies according to the following schedule (for each year ending September 30): 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 15% 14% 12% 10% 8% 6% 4% 2% As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, Gibraltar Life had cash and short term investments of approximately $1.172 billion and $5.768 billion, respectively, and fixed maturity investments classified as available for sale with fair values of $20.8 billion and $17.6 billion at those dates, respectively. Prudential Securities Group Liquidity Prudential Securities Group Inc. maintains a highly liquid balance sheet with substantially all of its assets consisting of securities purchased under agreements to resell, short term collateralized receivables from clients and broker dealers arising from securities transactions, marketable securities, securities borrowed and cash equivalents. Prudential Securities Groups assets totaled $20.3 billion and $22.8 billion as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Prudential Securities Groups total capitalization, including equity, subordinated debt and long term debt, was $3.6 billion and $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In October 2000, we announced that we would terminate our institutional fixed income activities that constituted the major portion of the debt capital markets operations of Prudential Securities Group. As of December 31, 2002, Prudential Securities Group had remaining assets amounting to approximately $900 million related to its institutional fixed income activities, as compared to $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2001. 127 Table of Contents Non Insurance Contractual Obligations The following table presents our contractual cash flow commitments on short term and long term debt, equity security units and operating leases as of December 31, 2002. See Notes 12, 13 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our short term and long term debt, equity security units and operating leases. This table does not reflect our obligations under our insurance, annuity and guaranteed products contracts. Payment Due by Period Total 2003 2004 and 2005 2006 and 2007 2008 and After (in millions) Short term and long term debt $ 8,226 $ 3,469 $ 537 $ 326 $ 3,894 Equity security units 690 690 Operating leases 1,687 281 464 348 594 Total $ 10,603 $ 3,750 $ 1,001 $ 1,364 $ 4,488 In connection with our consumer banking business, commitments for home equity lines of credit and other lines of credit include agreements to lend up to specified limits to customers. It is anticipated that commitment amounts will only be partially drawn down based on overall customer usage patterns and, therefore, do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each credit decision on such commitments at least annually and have the ability to cancel or suspend such lines at our option. The total commitments for home equity lines of credit and other lines of credit were $2.0 billion, of which $815 million remains available as of December 31, 2002. We also have other commitments, which primarily include commitments to originate and sell mortgage loans and commitments to fund investments in private placement securities and limited partnerships. These commitments amounted to $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2002. In connection with certain acquisitions, we agreed to pay additional consideration in future periods, based upon the attainment by the acquired entity of defined operating objectives. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, we do not accrue contingent consideration obligations prior to the attainment of the objectives. At December 31, 2002, maximum potential future consideration pursuant to such arrangements, to be resolved over the following six years, is $266 million. Any such payments would result in increases in goodwill. We provide financial guarantees incidental to other transactions. These credit related financial instruments have off balance sheet credit risk because only their origination fees, if any, and accruals for probable losses, if any, are recognized until the obligation under the instrument is fulfilled or expires. These instruments can extend for several years and expirations are not concentrated in any single period. We seek to control credit risk associated with these instruments by limiting credit, maintaining collateral where customary and appropriate and performing other monitoring procedures. As of December 31, 2002, financial guarantees were $841 million. The following table presents the expirations of the contractual commitments discussed above as of December 31, 2002. Expirations by Year Total 2003 2004 and 2005 2006 and 2007 2008 and After (in millions) Commitments for home equity and other lines of credit $ 815 $ 39 $ 175 $ 12 $ 589 Other commitments 2,224 1,032 417 413 362 Contingent consideration 266 20 132 83 31 Financial guarantees 841 51 269 72 449 Total $ 4,146 $ 1,142 $ 993 $ 580 $ 1,431 Ratings See Business Ratings for a summary of the Companys insurance claims paying ratings and credit ratings. 128 Table of Contents Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs We capitalize costs that vary with and are related primarily to the production of new insurance and annuity business. These costs include commissions, costs to issue and underwrite the policies and certain variable field office expenses. The capitalized amounts are known as deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC. Our total DAC, including the impact of unrealized investment gains and losses, amounted to $7.031 billion and $6.868 billion as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Approximately 51% of our total DAC as of December 31, 2002 relates to our Individual Life and Annuities segment, and approximately 16% relates to our Closed Block Business. If we were to experience a significant decrease in asset values or increase in lapse or surrender rates on policies for which we amortize DAC based on estimated gross margins or gross profits, such as participating and variable life insurance, we would expect acceleration of the write off of DAC for the affected blocks of policies. Additionally, for all policies on which we have outstanding DAC, we would be required to evaluate whether this experience called into question our ability to recover all or a portion of the DAC, and we would be required to write off some or all of the DAC if we concluded that we could not recover it. While an accelerated write off of DAC would not affect our cash flow or liquidity, it would negatively affect our reported earnings and level of capital under generally accepted accounting principles. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Guarantees As discussed under Liquidity and Capital Resources Non Insurance Contractual Obligations we provide guarantees incidental to other transactions and services. We provide a number of guarantees related to sales or transfers of real estate, in which the buyer has borrowed funds, and we have guaranteed their obligation to their lender. We provide these guarantees to assist them in obtaining financing for the transaction on more beneficial terms. In some instances, the buyer is an unconsolidated affiliate, and in other instances the buyer is unaffiliated and we retain no interests in the transferred asset. Our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees was $774 million as of December 31, 2002. Any payments that may become required by us under these guarantees would either first be reduced by proceeds received by the creditor on a sale of the assets, or would provide us with rights to obtain the assets. Other Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities, or variable interests in unconsolidated entities or other similar transactions, arrangements or relationships that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support, that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or our access to or requirements for capital resources. In addition, we do not have relationships with any unconsolidated entities that are contractually limited to narrow activities that facilitate our transfer of or access to assets. 129 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Risk Management, Market Risk and Derivative Instruments Risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns on the underlying assets or liabilities. We consider risk management an integral part of our core business. Market risk is the risk of change in the value of financial instruments as a result of absolute or relative changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates or equity or commodity prices. To varying degrees, the investment and trading activities supporting all of our products and services generate market risks. The market risks incurred and our strategies for managing these risks vary by product. With respect to non variable life insurance products, fixed rate annuities, the fixed rate options in our variable life insurance and annuity products, consumer banking products, and other finance businesses, we incur market risk primarily in the form of interest rate risk. We manage this risk through asset/liability management strategies that seek to match the interest rate sensitivity of the assets to that of the underlying liabilities. Our overall objective in these strategies is to limit the net change in value of assets and liabilities arising from interest rate movements. While it is more difficult to measure the interest sensitivity of our insurance liabilities than that of the related assets, to the extent that we can measure such sensitivities we believe that interest rate movements will generate asset value changes that substantially offset changes in the value of the liabilities relating to the underlying products. For variable annuities and variable life insurance products, excluding the fixed rate options in these products, mutual funds and most separate accounts, our main exposure to the market is the risk that asset management fees decrease as a result of declines in assets under management due to changes in prices of securities. We also run the risk that asset management fees calculated by reference to performance could be lower. For variable annuity and variable life insurance products with minimum guaranteed death benefits, we also face the risk that declines in the value of underlying investments as a result of changes in prices of securities may increase our net exposure to death benefits under these contracts. We do not believe that these risks add significantly to our overall market risk. We manage our exposure to equity price risk relating to our general account primarily by seeking to match the risk profile of equity investments against risk adjusted equity market benchmarks. We measure benchmark risk levels in terms of price volatility in relation to the market in general. The sources of our exposure to market risk can be divided into two categories, other than trading activities conducted primarily in our insurance, annuity and guaranteed products operations, and trading activities conducted primarily in our securities operations. As part of our management of both other than trading and trading market risks, we use a variety of risk management tools and techniques. These include sensitivity and Value at Risk (VaR) measures, position and other limits based on type of risk, and various hedging methods. Other Than Trading Activities We hold the majority of our assets for other than trading activities in our segments that offer insurance, annuities and guaranteed products. We incorporate asset/liability management techniques and other risk management policies and limits into the process of investing our assets. We use derivatives for hedging purposes in the asset/liability management process. Insurance, Annuities and Guaranteed Products Asset/Liability Management We seek to maintain interest rate and equity exposures within established ranges, which we periodically adjust based on market conditions and the design of related products sold to customers. Our risk managers establish investment risk limits for exposures to any issuer, geographic region, type of security or industry sector and oversee efforts to manage risk within policy constraints set by management and approved by the Board of Directors. 130 Table of Contents We use duration and convexity analyses to measure price sensitivity to interest rate changes. Duration measures the relative sensitivity of the fair value of a financial instrument to changes in interest rates. Convexity measures the rate of change of duration with respect to changes in interest rates. We seek to manage our interest rate exposure by legal entity by matching the relative sensitivity of asset and liability values to interest rate changes, or controlling duration mismatch of assets and liabilities. We have target duration mismatch constraints for each entity. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the difference between the pre tax duration of assets and the target duration of liabilities in our duration managed portfolios was within our constraint limits. We consider risk based capital implications in our asset/liability management strategies. We also perform portfolio stress testing as part of our regulatory cash flow testing. In this testing, we evaluate the impact of altering our interest sensitive assumptions under various moderately adverse interest rate environments. These interest sensitive assumptions relate to the timing and amount of redemptions and prepayments of fixed income securities and lapses and surrenders of insurance products. We evaluate any shortfalls that this cash flow testing reveals to determine if we need to increase statutory reserves or adjust portfolio management strategies. Market Risk Related to Interest Rates Our other than trading assets that subject us to interest rate risk include fixed maturity securities, commercial loans and policy loans. In the aggregate, the carrying value of these assets represented 70% of our consolidated assets, other than assets that we held in separate accounts, as of December 31, 2002 and 64% as of December 31, 2001. With respect to other than trading liabilities, we are exposed to interest rate risk through policyholder account balances relating to interest sensitive life insurance, annuity and investment type contracts and through outstanding short term and long term debt. 131 Table of Contents We assess interest rate sensitivity for other than trading financial assets, financial liabilities and derivatives using hypothetical test scenarios that assume either upward or downward 100 basis point parallel shifts in the yield curve from prevailing interest rates. The following tables set forth the potential loss in fair value from a hypothetical 100 basis point upward shift at December 31, 2002 and 2001, because this scenario results in the greatest net exposure to interest rate risk of the hypothetical scenarios tested at those dates. While the test scenario is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future interest rates or the performance of fixed income markets, it is a near term, reasonably possible hypothetical change that illustrates the potential impact of such events. These test scenarios do not measure the changes in value that could result from non parallel shifts in the yield curve, which we would expect to produce different changes in discount rates for different maturities. As a result, the actual loss in fair value from a 100 basis point change in interest rates could be different from that indicated by these calculations.

We believe that the interest rate sensitivities of these insurance liabilities offset, in large measure, the interest rate risk of the financial assets set forth in these tables. The $1,255 million increase in the total estimated potential loss at December 31, 2002 from December 31, 2001 resulted primarily from the increase in our portfolio of fixed maturities available for sale during 2002. The estimated changes in fair values of our financial assets shown above relate primarily to assets invested to support our insurance liabilities, but do not include assets associated with products for which investment risk is borne primarily by the contract holders rather than by us. Market Risk Related to Equity Prices We actively manage equity price risk against benchmarks in respective markets. We benchmark our return on equity holdings against a blend of market indices, mainly the S&P 500 and Russell 2000, and we target price sensitivities that approximate those of the benchmark indices. We estimate our equity price risk from a hypothetical 10% decline in equity benchmark market levels and measure this risk in terms of the decline in fair market value of equity securities we hold. Using this methodology, our estimated equity price risk at December 31, 2002 was $281 million, representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of equity securities we held at that date from $2.807 billion to $2.526 billion. Our estimated equity price risk using this methodology at December 31, 2001 was $227 million, representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of equity securities we held at that date from $2.272 billion to $2.045 billion. In calculating these amounts, we exclude equity securities related to products for which the investment risk is borne primarily by the contractholder rather than by us. While these scenarios are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect our expectations regarding future performance of equity markets or of our equity portfolio, they represent near term reasonably possible hypothetical changes that illustrate the potential impact of such events. Market Risk Related to Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in our general account and through our operations in foreign countries. In our international life insurance business, we generally invest in assets denominated in the same currencies as our insurance liabilities, which mitigates our foreign currency exchange rate risk for these operations. Our exposure to foreign currency risk within the general account investment portfolios supporting our U.S. insurance operations arises primarily from purchased investments that are denominated or payable in foreign currencies. We generally hedge substantially all foreign currency denominated fixed income investments supporting our U.S. operations into U.S. dollars, using foreign exchange forward contracts and currency swaps, in order to mitigate the risk that the fair value of these investments fluctuates as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates. We generally do not hedge all of the foreign currency risk of our equity investments in unaffiliated foreign entities. Our operations in foreign countries create two additional sources of foreign currency risk. First, we reflect the operating results of our foreign branches and subsidiaries in our financial statements based on the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. We hedge some of these foreign currency flows based on our overall risk management strategy and loss limits. We generally hedge our anticipated exposure to adjusted operating income fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our International operations in Japan, of which our Japanese insurance operations are the most significant, using foreign exchange forward contracts and currency swaps. Second, we translate our equity investment in foreign branches and subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using the foreign currency exchange rate at the financial statement period end date. We have chosen to partially hedge this exposure. We actively manage foreign currency exchange rate risk within specified limits at the consolidated level using Value at Risk analysis. This statistical technique estimates, at a specified confidence level, the potential pre tax loss in portfolio market value that could occur over an assumed time horizon due to adverse market movements. We calculate this using a variance/covariance approach. 133 Table of Contents We calculate Value at Risk estimates of exposure to loss from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates for one month time periods. Our estimated VaR at December 31, 2002 for foreign currency assets not hedged to U.S. dollars, measured at the 95% confidence level and using a one month time horizon, was $9 million, representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of these foreign currency assets from $494 million to $485 million. Our estimated VaR at December 31, 2001 for foreign currency assets not hedged to U.S. dollars, measured at the 95% confidence level and using a one month time horizon, was $9 million, representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of these foreign currency assets from $495 million to $486 million. These calculations use historical price volatilities and correlation data at a 95% confidence level. We discuss limitations of VaR models below. Our estimated VaR for foreign exchange forward contracts and currency swaps used to hedge our anticipated exposure to adjusted operating income fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our international operations, measured at the 95% confidence level and using a one month time horizon, was $110 million at December 31, 2002 and $45 million at December 31, 2001. Our average monthly Value at Risk for foreign currency assets not hedged to U.S. dollars from foreign currency exchange rate movements, measured at the 95% confidence level over a one month time horizon, was $15 million during 2002 and $13 million during 2001. Derivatives Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices, or the prices of securities or commodities. Derivative financial instruments may be exchange traded or contracted in the over the counter market and include swaps, futures, options and forward contracts. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our derivative positions as of December 31, 2002 and 2001. Under insurance statutes, our insurance companies may use derivative financial instruments to hedge actual or anticipated changes in their assets or liabilities, to replicate cash market instruments or for certain income generating activities. These statutes generally prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. We use derivative financial instruments primarily to seek to reduce market risk from changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates, and to alter interest rate or foreign currency exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities. In addition, derivatives are used in our securities operations for trading purposes. Trading Activities We engage in trading activities primarily in connection with our securities businesses. We maintain trading inventories in various equity and fixed income securities, foreign exchange instruments and commodities, primarily to facilitate transactions for our clients. Market risk affects the values of our trading inventories through fluctuations in absolute or relative interest rates, credit spreads, foreign currency exchange rates, securities and commodity prices. We seek to use short security positions and forwards, futures, options and other derivatives to limit exposure to interest rate and other market risks. We also trade derivative financial instruments that allow our clients to manage exposure to interest rate, currency and other market risks. Most of our derivative transactions involve exchange listed contracts and are short term in duration. We act both as a broker, by selling exchange listed contracts, and as a dealer, by entering into futures and security transactions as a principal. As a broker, we assume counterparty and credit risks that we seek to mitigate by using margin or other credit enhancements and by establishing trading limits and credit lines. As a dealer, we are subject to market risk as well as counterparty and credit risk. We manage the market risk associated with trading activities through hedging activities and formal policies, risk and position limits, counterparty and credit limits, daily position monitoring, and other forms of risk management. Value at Risk VaR is one of the tools we use to monitor and manage our exposure to the market risk of our trading activities. We calculate a VaR that encompasses our trading activities using a 95% confidence level. The VaR method incorporates the risk factors to which the market value of our trading activities is exposed, which consist of interest rates, including credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices, estimates of volatilities from historical data, the sensitivity of our trading activities to changes in those market factors and 134 Table of Contents the correlations of those factors. We regularly test our VaR model by comparing actual adverse results to those estimated by the VaR model with a 95% confidence level over a one day time horizon. The VaR for our trading activities expressed in terms of adverse changes to fair value at the 95% confidence level over a one day time horizon was $2 million at December 31, 2002 and $5 million at December 31, 2001. The average daily VaR for our trading activities, expressed in terms of adverse changes to fair value with a 95% confidence level over a one day time horizon, was $4 million during 2002 and $6 million during 2001. The following table sets forth a breakdown of this VaR by risk component as follows: As of December 31, 2002 Average for2002 As of December 31, 2001 Average for2001 (in millions) Interest rate risk $ 2 $ 4 $ 5 $ 5 Equity risk 1 Total(1) $ 2 $ 4 $ 5 $ 6 (1) At December 31, 2002 and 2001, and during the years then ended, VaR from each of foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity risk in our trading activities was immaterial. Limitations of VaR Models Although VaR models represent a recognized tool for risk management, they have inherent limitations, including reliance on historical data that may not be indicative of future market conditions or trading patterns. Accordingly, you should not view VaR models as a predictor of future results. We may incur losses that could be materially in excess of the amounts indicated by the models on a particular trading day or over a period of time, and there have been instances when results have fallen outside the values generated by our VaR models. A VaR model does not estimate the greatest possible loss. We use these models together with other risk management tools, including stress testing. The results of these models and analysis thereof are subject to the judgment of our risk management personnel. 135 Table of Contents
