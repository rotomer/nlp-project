ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS: This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All statements in this document, other than statements of historical fact, are forward looking statements which may be identified by the use of the words "expects," "believes," "anticipates," "plans," "would," "should," "may," "estimates" and similar expressions. These forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may cause Public Storages actual results and performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements. As a result, you should not rely on any forward looking statements in this report, or which management may make orally or in writing from time to time, as predictions of future events nor guarantees of future performance. We caution you not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements, which speak only as the date of this report or as of the dates indicated in the statements. All of our forward looking statements, including those in this report, are qualified in their entirely by this statement. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, new estimates, or other factors, events or circumstances after the date of this document, except where expressly required by law. Accordingly, you should use caution in relying on past forward looking statements to anticipate future results. Factors and risks that may impact our future results and performance include, but are not limited to, those described in Item 1A, "Risk Factors" and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). These risks include, among others, the following: o general risks associated with the ownership and operation of real estate including changes in demand for our storage facilities, potential liability for environmental contamination, adverse changes in tax, real estate and zoning laws and regulations, and the impact of natural disasters; o risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies in the markets in which we operate; o the risk that Public Storage may for any reason be unable to finalize negotiations and completion of a possible transaction involving Shurgard Europe; o the impact of competition from new and existing storage and commercial facilities and other storage alternatives; o difficulties in our ability to successfully evaluate, finance, integrate into our operations and manage acquired and developed properties; o risks related to our participation in joint ventures; o risks associated with international operations including, but not limited to, unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations that could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows; o the impact of the regulatory environment as well as national, state, and local laws and regulations including, without limitation, those governing REITs; o risks associated with a possible failure by us to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; o disruptions or shutdowns of our automated processes and systems; o difficulties in raising capital at a reasonable cost; 31 o delays in the development process; and o economic uncertainty due to the impact of war or terrorism. The risks included here are not exhaustive as it is not possible for management to predict all possible risk factors that may exist or emerge from time to time. Investors should refer to our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q for future periods and current reports on Form 8 K and other information filed from time to time with the SEC for additional information. OVERVIEW Public Storage was organized in 1980. Effective June 1, 2007, following approval by our shareholders, we reorganized Public Storage, Inc. into Public Storage, a Maryland real estate investment trust (referred to herein as "the Company", "the Trust", "we", "us", or "our"). We are a fully integrated, self administered and self managed real estate investment trust ("REIT") whose principal business activities include the acquisition, development, ownership and operation of self storage facilities which offer storage spaces for lease, generally on a month to month basis, for personal and business use. We are the largest owner and operator of self storage facilities in the United States ("U.S."), and we have an interest in what we believe is the largest owner and operator of self storage facilities in Europe. We significantly increased the scope and scale of our operations on August 22, 2006, when we merged with Shurgard Storage Centers, Inc., ("Shurgard" and the merger referred to as the "Shurgard Merger"), a REIT which had an interest in 487 self storage facilities located in the U.S. and an interest in a platform of self storage facilities in seven Western European countries. At December 31, 2007, we had direct and indirect equity interests in 2,012 self storage facilities located in 38 states within the U.S. operating under the "Public Storage" name containing approximately 126 million net rentable square feet of space, and 174 self storage facilities located in seven Western European countries which operate under the "Shurgard Storage Centers" name containing approximately nine million net rentable square feet of space. We also have direct and indirect equity interests in approximately 21 million net rentable square feet of commercial space located in 11 states in the U.S. operated under the "PS Business Parks" and Public Storage brands. Competition in the market areas in which we operate is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates, rental income and operating expenses of our facilities. Development of new self storage facilities has intensified the competition among storage operators in many market areas in which we operate. BUSINESS ATTRIBUTES We believe that we possess several primary business attributes that permit us to compete effectively: CENTRALIZED INFORMATION NETWORKS: Our facilities in the U.S. and Europe are part of comprehensive centralized reporting and information networks which enable our U.S. and European management teams to identify changing market conditions and operating trends as well as analyze customer data, and quickly change our properties pricing and promotional mix on an automated basis. NATIONAL TELEPHONE RESERVATION CENTER: In the U.S., we operate a centralized telephone reservation system, which provides added customer service and helps to maximize utilization of available self storage space. Customers calling either the toll free telephone referral system, (800) 44 STORE, or a storage facility, are directed to the national reservation system. A representative discusses with the customer space requirements, price and location preferences and also informs the customer of other products and services provided by the Company and its subsidiaries. We believe that the centralized telephone reservation system enhances our ability to market storage space in the United States relative to handling these calls at individual properties, because it allows us to more effectively offer all spaces at all facilities in the vicinity of a customer and we can provide higher quality selling efforts through dedicated sales specialists trained in a central location. We also provide customers the opportunity to review space availability and make reservations online through our website, www.publicstorage.com. 32 ECONOMIES OF SCALE: We are the largest provider of self storage space in the U.S. and Europe. As of December 31, 2007, we operated 2,186 storage facilities in which we had an interest and managed 31 self storage facilities for third parties. These facilities are in markets within 38 states in the U.S. and seven Western European countries. At December 31, 2007, we had over 1,095,000 self storage spaces rented. The size and scope of our operations have enabled us to achieve high operating margins and a low level of administrative costs relative to revenues, through the centralization of many functions with specialists, such as facility maintenance, employee compensation and benefits programs, pricing of our product, as well as the development and documentation of standardized operating procedures. We also believe that our major market concentration provides managerial efficiencies stemming from having a large number of facilities in close proximity to each other. BRAND NAME RECOGNITION: Our operations in the U.S. are conducted under the "Public Storage" brand name, which we believe is the most recognized and established name in the self storage industry in the U.S. Our storage operations within the U.S. are conducted in 38 states, giving us national recognition and prominence. Our facilities tend to be in highly visible and heavily populated areas, improving the local awareness of our brand. Customer awareness of self storage in Europe is emerging. All of our facilities in Europe are operating under the "Shurgard Storage Centers" brand name. We believe we are the single largest self storage operator in Western Europe as of December 31, 2007. MAJOR MARKET CONCENTRATION IN THE U.S.: We focus our operations in the major markets in the U.S., which we believe enhances our marketing efficiency. We can economically purchase large, prominent, well placed yellow page ads that allow us to reach the consumer more effectively than smaller operators. We are also able to purchase and bid aggressively for multiple keyword advertising on national Internet search engines. In addition, we are able to market efficiently using television as a media source. We believe that our competitors cannot use television advertising, because their limited concentration of facilities does not provide a sufficient potential customer base to offset the high cost of television advertising. In addition, we believe that in recent years, zoning requirements in some of the major metropolitan markets in which we operate in the U.S. have increased, resulting in more barriers to new competition. While this has limited our new development opportunities, it has minimized supply increases and competition with certain of our properties. RETAIL OPERATIONS: Through a taxable REIT subsidiary, we sell retail items associated with the storage business and rent trucks at our self storage facilities in order to supplement and strengthen the existing self storage business by further meeting the needs of storage customers. Each of our self storage locations rental offices sell locks, boxes, and packing materials, while certain of the facilities in the U.S. also rent trucks primarily to storage customers or operate as an agent of long distance truck rental companies. These rental offices which conduct these activities include, in some cases, larger retail oriented locations. TENANT INSURANCE PROGRAM: Through taxable REIT subsidiaries, we reinsure policies issued to our tenants against lost or damaged goods stored by tenants in our storage facilities. These subsidiaries receive the premiums and bear the risks associated with the re insurance. We believe that our tenant insurance operations further supplement and strengthen the existing self storage business and provide an additional source of earnings for the Company. GROWTH AND INVESTMENT STRATEGIES Our growth strategies consist of: (i) improving the operating performance of our existing self storage properties, (ii) acquiring properties that are owned or operated by others in the U.S., (iii) expanding and repackaging existing U.S. real estate facilities, (iv) participating in the growth of commercial facilities owned primarily by PSB and (v) capitalizing on the potential growth in the European market. These strategies are described as follows: IMPROVE THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF EXISTING PROPERTIES: We seek to increase the net cash flow generated by our existing self storage properties by 33 a) regularly evaluating our call volume, reservation activity, and move in/move out rates for each of our properties relative to our marketing activities, b) evaluating market supply and demand factors and, based upon these analyses, adjusting our marketing activities and rental rates, c) attempting to maximize revenues through evaluating the appropriate balance between occupancy, rental rates, and promotional discounting and d) controlling expense levels. We believe that our property management personnel and systems, combined with the national telephone reservation system and media advertising programs will continue to enhance our ability to meet these goals. ACQUIRE PROPERTIES OWNED OR OPERATED BY OTHERS IN THE U.S.: We believe our presence in and knowledge of substantially all of the major markets in the U.S. enhances our ability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities and capitalize on the overall fragmentation in the self storage industry. Data on the rental rates and occupancy levels of our existing facilities, which are often located in proximity to potential acquisition candidates, provide us an advantage in evaluating the potential of acquisition opportunities. EXPAND AND REPACKAGE EXISTING REAL ESTATE FACILITIES: We have a substantial number of facilities in the U.S. that were developed and constructed 20 or more years ago based upon local competitive and demographic conditions in place at that time. Population densities and other such conditions may have changed since then, providing opportunities to expand and further invest into our existing self storage locations, either by improving the quality of the existing units by adding amenities such as climate control, or by expanding these facilities at a per square foot cost that is typically less than the cost incurred in developing a new location. At December 31, 2007, we have identified 27 such projects to expand or repackage our existing facilities in the U.S., for an aggregate cost of approximately $106.9 million, which will add an aggregate of approximately 1,105,000 net rentable square feet. Completion of these projects is subject to contingencies, including obtaining governmental agency approvals. We continue to evaluate our existing real estate portfolio to identify additional expansion and repackaging opportunities. In recent years, our rate of development of new self storage facilities in the U.S. has declined due to increases in construction cost, increases in competition with retail, condominium, and apartment operators for quality self storage sites in urban locations, and more difficult zoning and permitting requirements. We will continue to seek favorable sites and markets for development, based upon current market conditions. In the short term we do not expect any significant investment in new development locations in the U.S. PARTICIPATE IN THE GROWTH OF COMMERCIAL FACILITIES PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR OWNERSHIP IN PS BUSINESS PARKS, INC.: At December 31, 2007, we had a 45% common equity interest in PSB and its operating partnership which, consisted of 5,418,273 shares of common stock and 7,305,355 limited partnership units in the Operating Partnership. The limited partnership units are convertible at our option, subject to certain conditions, on a one for one basis into PSB common stock. At December 31, 2007, PSB owned and operated approximately 19.6 million net rentable square feet of commercial space located in the U.S. located in eight states. CAPITALIZE ON THE POTENTIAL FOR GROWTH IN EUROPE: Our European operations are conducted through Shurgard Self Storage SCA, a Belgian company referred to hereinafter as "Shurgard Europe". The self storage market in Europe is relatively new, making it difficult to obtain reliable statistics regarding competition throughout Europe. We track and maintain information regarding customers and competitors in the markets in which we operate, and in markets where we are considering expansion. According to the most recent data provided by the Federation of European Self Storage Associations ("FEDESSA"), the self storage market in Europe (defined as Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) consisted of approximately 1,090 stores as of March 2007, approximately 600 of which are located in the United Kingdom. We believe, however, that because of the number of new entrants into the market, FEDESSA may understate the total number of stores in many markets even as of the date reported. Less fragmented than the U.S. market, the European self storage market is dominated by a handful of larger players and a few midsized operators, with the remainder of the market consisting of smaller operators. The top five operators of stores in Europe, of which we believe we are the largest, collectively have approximately 45% of the aggregate market share for self storage space, based on net rentable square footage, as of March 2007. Because of the number of new entrants into the market and difficulties in collecting data, the information presented by FEDESSA at any 34 time may understate the total number of stores in many markets. However, we believe the information presented by FEDESSA is the best available measure of market size and competition. Although many European consumers are not yet aware of the self storage concept, they tend to live in more densely populated areas in smaller living spaces (as compared to the U.S.) that, we believe, should make self storage an attractive option as product knowledge and availability grows. Most Europeans are familiar with the concept of storage only as an ancillary service provided by moving companies. The service provided by moving companies is typically full service, prevents direct access by customers and may involve security issues for the users because they have less control over their goods in storage. In addition, most of these moving companies require advance notice to retrieve goods and charge handling fees and minimum monthly fees, making the cost of smaller storage requirements costly. As a result of this low density of self storage in Europe relative to population as compared to the U.S., we believe that there is significant growth potential in Europe, even if the density of self storage in Europe does not ultimately approach the levels in the U.S. Capitalizing on this opportunity will require a significant amount of capital to develop new self storage facilities in what could be a process extending through a few decades in time frame, similar to the trajectory of the U.S. self storage industry since its inception in the mid 1960s. Notwithstanding the potential of this opportunity, we believe that it is not appropriate to invest significant amounts of our existing U.S. based capital into Europe, because of a) the lack of tax efficiency of operating in various tax jurisdictions, many of which subject these operations to income tax as well as certain taxes upon repatriation of funds to the U.S., b) constraints on ownership or operations required in order to satisfy the statutory requirements of being a U.S. REIT, as well as c) the differing risk/return profile of such investments in European self storage operations relative to the expectations of our existing investor base. Accordingly, we believe that separate sources of capital obtained through a separate public European based entity, best positions our European operations for long term growth. We attempted a share offering in Europe in mid 2007 in order to establish such a public entity; however, the offering was abandoned because market conditions were and continue to be unfavorable. In January 2008, we announced that we reached an agreement in principle for a prospective investor to acquire a 51% ownership interest in Shurgard Europe in a private transaction at a price generally consistent with the previously disclosed proceeds we expected to receive for our equity interest in last years terminated European share offering. No binding agreement has been signed with the prospective investor and there is no assurance that a binding agreement will be signed or that a transaction will be completed. We estimate the completion of the transaction at the end of the first quarter of 2008 assuming a binding agreement is signed and the conditions related to the transaction are satisfied. While we intend to reduce our exposure to Europe for the aforementioned reasons, we intend to continue to hold a significant minority position in Shurgard Europe in order to participate in this entitys growth. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discuss our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements summarizes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Management believes the following are critical accounting policies whose application has a material impact on the Companys financial presentation. That is, they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. 35 QUALIFICATION AS A REIT INCOME TAX EXPENSE: We believe that we have been organized and operated, and we intend to continue to operate, as a qualifying REIT under the Code and applicable state laws. We also believe that Shurgard qualified as a REIT. A REIT generally does not pay corporate level income taxes on its REIT taxable income that is distributed to its shareholders, and accordingly, we do not pay income tax on the share of our REIT taxable income that is distributed to our shareholders. We therefore do not estimate or accrue any federal income tax expense for income earned and distributed related to REIT operations. This estimate could be incorrect, because due to the complex nature of the REIT qualification requirements, the ongoing importance of factual determinations and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, we cannot be assured that we actually have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements for taxation as a REIT for any particular taxable year. For any taxable year that we fail or have failed to qualify as a REIT and for which applicable relief provisions did not apply, we would be taxed at the regular corporate rates on all of our taxable income, whether or not we made or make any distributions to our shareholders. Any resulting requirement to pay corporate income tax, including any applicable penalties or interest, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we also would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year for which qualification was lost. There can be no assurance that we would be entitled to any statutory relief. In addition, if Shurgard failed to qualify as a REIT, we generally would have succeeded to or incurred significant tax liabilities. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG LIVED ASSETS: Substantially all of our assets consist of long lived assets, including real estate and other intangible assets. The evaluation of our long lived assets for impairment includes determining whether indicators of impairment exist, which is a subjective process. When any indicators of impairment are found, the evaluation of such long lived assets then entails projections of future operating cash flows, which also involves significant judgment. Future events, or facts and circumstances that currently exist, that we have not yet identified, could cause us to conclude in the future that our long lived assets are impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF LONG LIVED ASSETS: Substantially all of our assets consist of depreciable, long lived assets. We record depreciation expense with respect to these assets based upon their estimated useful lives. Any change in the estimated useful lives of those assets, caused by functional or economic obsolescence or other factors, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. ESTIMATED LEVEL OF RETAINED RISK AND UNPAID TENANT CLAIM LIABILITIES: As described in Notes 2 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements, we retain certain risks with respect to property perils, legal liability, and other such risks. In addition, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company reinsures policies against claims for losses to goods stored by tenants in our self storage facilities. In connection with these risks, we accrue losses based upon the estimated level of losses incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based on recommendations from an independent actuary that is a member of the American Academy of Actuaries. While we believe that the amounts of the accrued losses are adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of or less than the amounts recorded. At December 31, 2007, we had approximately 490,000 reinsured policies in the U.S. outstanding representing aggregate coverage of approximately $1.2 billion. ACCRUALS FOR CONTINGENCIES: We are exposed to business and legal liability risks with respect to events that have occurred, but in accordance with GAAP, we have not accrued for such potential liabilities because the loss is either not probable or not estimable or because we are not aware of the event. Future events and the result of pending litigation could result in such potential losses becoming probable and estimable, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Some of these potential losses, of which we are aware, are described in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements. ACCRUALS FOR OPERATING EXPENSES: We accrue for property tax expense and certain other operating expenses based upon estimates and historical trends and current and anticipated local and state government rules and regulations. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, our expenses could be misstated. Cost of operations, interest expense, general and administrative expense, as well as television, yellow page, and other advertising expenditures are expensed as incurred. 36 VALUATION OF DERIVATIVES: As described in our Significant Accounting Policies in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, our derivative instruments are not considered effective hedges. Accordingly, any changes in value of these derivatives are reflected as an increase or decrease in net income. The determination of the value of derivatives is based upon significant judgment and assumptions including interest rates, currency rates, and expected rates of return. The actual value of derivative instruments is dependent upon many factors that our judgments and assumptions may not consider, or may not consider effectively. EUROPEAN NET OPERATING LOSSES INCOME TAX TREATMENT: The Shurgard European real estate operations generated significant operating losses from inception to the date of the Shurgard Merger. We recorded a deferred tax asset arising from the net operating loss carry forward as of the date of acquisition, and recorded a valuation allowance against any net deferred tax asset based on the filing groups in the various countries. To the extent that we determine the valuation allowance is no longer required for the deferred tax asset associated with the filing group, the change in the valuation allowance will first be treated as a reduction of goodwill and other intangible assets related to the Shurgard Merger before being treated as a reduction to the provision for income taxes. VALUATION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ACQUIRED IN THE SHURGARD MERGER: We have estimated the fair value of real estate, intangible assets, debt, and the other assets and other liabilities acquired in the Shurgard Merger. In addition, we have estimated the fair market value of the 38.9 million shares that we issued to the Shurgard shareholders. These estimates are based upon many assumptions, including interest rates, market values of land and buildings in the U.S. and Europe, estimated future cash flows from the then tenant base in place, and the recoverability of certain assets. We believe that the assumptions used were reasonable, however, these assumptions were subject to a significant degree of judgment, and others could come to materially different conclusions as to the estimated values, if different assumptions were used. If the values were determined using different assumptions than those used, our depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, real estate, debt, and intangible assets could have been materially different. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OPERATING RESULTS FOR 2007 AS COMPARED TO 2006: Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $457.5 million compared to $314.0 million for the same period in 2006, representing an increase of $143.5 million. This increase is primarily due to improved operations from our real estate facilities combined with an increased foreign currency exchange gain and a reduction in general and administrative expense. These items were partially offset by increases in depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense. Comparisons of our revenues, expenses, and weighted average shares outstanding are significantly impacted by the Shurgard Merger, which closed on August 22, 2006. The results with respect to the assets and liabilities acquired in the Shurgard Merger are included in our operating results from August 23, 2006 through December 31, 2006 during the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the entire year ended December 31, 2007. Net operating income, before depreciation, for our self storage operations totaled $1,082.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $810.8 million for the same period in 2006, representing an increase of $271.4 million. The increase is primarily due to the addition of 647 facilities that we acquired in the Shurgard Merger. Net operating income of the former Shurgard properties was approximately $347.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $110.1 million for the same period in 2006, which reflects the operations of these facilities from August 23, 2006 through December 31, 2006. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized a foreign currency exchange gain aggregating $57.6 million relating to intercompany loans between our U.S. and European subsidiaries. The gain was the result of the continued weakening of the US Dollar relative to the Euro during the year ended December 31, 2007. See "FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAIN" below for further information. General and administrative expense declined $24.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006. This decline was primarily due to the reduction in integration expenses associated with the 37 Shurgard Merger, contract termination costs, and development costs that were expensed with respect to terminated projects; offset partially by costs incurred in 2007 with respect to our reorganization as a Maryland REIT, and the costs associated with a proposed offering of shares in our European business. These expenses aggregated $56.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $19.0 million for the same period in 2007. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased by $184.8 million, as compared to the same period in 2006. This increase is primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization expense with respect to the buildings and intangible assets acquired in the Shurgard Merger. Net income allocable to our common shareholders (after allocating net income to our preferred and equity shareholders) was $199.4 million or $1.17 per common share on a diluted basis for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $46.9 million or $0.33 per common share on a diluted basis for the same period in 2006, representing an increase of $152.5 million or $0.84 per common share on a diluted basis. The increase in net income allocable to common shareholders and earnings per common share on a diluted basis are due primarily to the impact of the factors described above with respect to net income, as well as a decrease in income allocated to preferred shareholders, as described below. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we allocated $236.8 million and $214.2 million of our net income, respectively, to our preferred shareholders based on distributions paid. The year over year increase is due to the issuance of additional preferred securities, partially offset by the redemption of preferred securities that had higher dividend rates than the newly preferred securities issued. In 2006, we also recorded allocations of income to our preferred shareholders with respect to the application of EITF Topic D 42 totaling $31.5 million (or $0.22 per common share on a diluted basis) in connection with the redemption of preferred securities. Weighted average diluted shares increased to 170,147,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007 from 143,715,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in weighted average diluted shares is due primarily to the impact of the issuance of 38.9 million shares in connection with the Shurgard Merger. OPERATING RESULTS FOR 2006 AS COMPARED TO 2005: Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $314.0 million compared to $456.4 million for the same period in 2005, representing a decrease of $142.4 million, or 31%. This decrease is primarily due to the temporary impact of certain items related to the Shurgard Merger. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we incurred amortization expense totaling $175.9 million due to the amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in the merger and approximately $44.0 million in merger integration expenses. Comparisons of our revenues, expenses, and weighted average shares outstanding are significantly impacted by the Shurgard Merger, which closed on August 22, 2006. The results with respect to the assets and liabilities acquired in the Shurgard Merger are included in our operating results from August 23, 2006 through December 31, 2006 during the year ended December 31, 2006, and none for the year ended December 31, 2005. These items were partially offset by improved operations from our self storage facilities, reduced minority interest in income and higher interest income. Net operating income for our self storage operations, before depreciation expense, increased from $630.8 million in 2005 to $810.8 million in 2006, representing an increase of $180.0 million. This increase was largely due to the acquisition of additional facilities in the Shurgard Merger. We earned an aggregate of $110.1 million in net operating income with respect to the facilities acquired from Shurgard, reflecting the operating results of the facilities acquired from the date of the merger August 22, 2006, through December 31, 2006. Net income allocable to our common shareholders (after allocating net income to our preferred and equity shareholders) was $46.9 million or $0.33 per common share on a diluted basis for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $254.4 million or $1.97 per common share on a diluted basis for the same period in 2005, representing a decrease of $207.5 million or $1.64 per common share. The decreases in net income allocable to common shareholders and earnings per 38 common diluted share are due primarily to the impact of the factors described above with respect to net income, in addition to increased income allocated to preferred shareholders, described below. For the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we allocated $214.2 million and $173.0 million of our net income, respectively, to our preferred shareholders based on distributions paid. The year over year increase is due to the issuance of additional preferred securities, partially offset by the redemption of preferred securities that had higher dividend rates than the newly issued preferred securities. In connection with the redemption of preferred securities, we also recorded allocations of income to our preferred shareholders with respect to the application of EITF Topic D 42 totaling $31.5 million (or $0.22 per diluted common share) and $7.5 million (or $0.06 per diluted common share) for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Weighted average diluted shares increased to 143,715,000 for year ended December 31, 2006 from 128,819,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in weighted average diluted shares is due primarily to the issuance of approximately 38.9 million shares in the Shurgard Merger, which are included in our weighted average shares from August 22, 2006 through December 31, 2006. REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS DOMESTIC SELF STORAGE OPERATIONS: Our domestic self storage operations are by far the largest component of our operating activities, representing approximately 81% of our total revenues generated for the year ended December 31, 2007. Rental income with respect to our domestic self storage operations grew by 24.4% in 2007 as compared to 2006 and by 24.1% in 2006 as compared to 2005. The year over year growth in rental income is primarily due to the acquisition of additional facilities in connection with the Shurgard Merger combined with the addition of new facilities to our portfolio, either through our acquisition or development activities. To enhance year over year comparisons, the following table summarizes, and the ensuing discussion describes the operating results of three groups that management analyzes with respect to the Companys performance. The Public Storage Same Store group, representing our most mature facilities that we have owned prior to January 1, 2004, the Shurgard Same Store group, representing a mature group of facilities that we have owned since August 22, 2006 in connection with the Shurgard Merger; and Other facilities which primarily include Shurgard facilities we acquired other than the Same Store Facilities, as well as the facilities developed or acquired over the past three years. 39 DOMESTIC SELF STORAGE OPERATIONS SUMMARY: Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Percentage Percentage 2007 2006 Change 2006 2005 Change (Dollar amounts in thousands) Rental income: Same Store Facilities Public Storage...... $ 925,088 $ 906,076 2.1% $ 906,076 $ 860,533 5.3% Same Store Facilities Shurgard............ 268,183 91,956 191.6% 91,956 Other Facilities............................ 274,904 182,202 50.9% 182,202 90,837 100.6% Total rental income....................... 1,468,175 1,180,234 24.4% 1,180,234 951,370 24.1% Cost of operations before depreciation and amortization expense (a): Same Store Facilities Public Storage...... 301,429 299,547 0.6% 299,547 286,645 4.5% Same Store Facilities Shurgard............ 87,692 32,439 170.3% 32,439 Other Facilities............................ 98,861 66,774 48.1% 66,774 33,944 96.7% Total cost of operations................. 487,982 398,760 22.4% 398,760 320,589 24.4% Net operating income before depreciation and amortization expense (a): Same Store Facilities Public Storage...... 623,659 606,529 2.8% 606,529 573,888 5.7% Same Store Facilities Shurgard............ 180,491 59,517 203.3% 59,517 Other Facilities............................ 176,043 115,428 52.5% 115,428 56,893 102.9% Total net operating income before depreciation and amortization expense (a) 980,193 781,474 25.4% 781,474 630,781 23.9% Depreciation and amortization expense: Same Store Facilities Public Storage......

See Note 14 to our December 31, 2007 consolidated financial statements, "Segment Information," which includes a reconciliation of net operating income before depreciation and amortization for this segment to our consolidated net income. Although depreciation and amortization are operating expenses, we believe that NOI is a meaningful measure of operating performance, because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, in determining current property values, segment performance, and comparing period to period and market to market property operating results. NOI is not a substitute for net operating income after depreciation and amortization in evaluating our operating results. In the discussion that follows, we present realized annual rent per occupied square foot, which is computed by dividing rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the weighted average occupied square footage for the period. We also present annualized rental income per available square foot ("REVPAF"), which represents annualized rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, divided by total available net rentable square feet. Late charges and administrative fees are excluded to more effectively measure our ongoing level of revenue associated with the leasing of the units. In the above table, the significant increases in revenues and cost of operations, in 2007 and 2006 as compared to 2005 are primarily due to the 40 acquisition of self storage facilities in connection with the Shurgard Merger which was completed on August 22, 2006 (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). As a result of the Shurgard Merger, we acquired interests in 487 self storage facilities (32.3 million net rentable square feet) located in the U.S. Immediately preceding the close of the Shurgard Merger, all of the acquired facilities in the U.S. were integrated into our property management systems, centralized pricing systems, national call center, and website. Temporary signage, re branding the facilities from "Shurgard" to "Public Storage", was also put into place immediately after the close of the Shurgard Merger. Our property management personnel worked diligently to absorb this large acquisition of facilities. Training and hiring new property managers were key elements for the successful integration process. New employees needed to be trained on how to use our property management systems and follow our operating policies and procedures. As expected in a merger of this nature, immediately following the close of the merger, turnover at the property manager level was higher than we normally experience. In anticipation of such turnover, we began to hire additional "bench" property managers in the second quarter of 2006 to fill openings when turnover occurred. Although this strategy was effective at keeping properties opened for business, it did result in incurring additional payroll costs in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2006 due to the additional head count. As a result of the Shurgard Merger, the amount of vacant space increased significantly in our system. The acquired Shurgard portfolio of 487 facilities in the U.S. had aggregate average square foot occupancy of 84.4% at August 31, 2006, which was 530 basis points below the 89.7% for the existing Public Storage portfolio. Average rental rates were approximately the same for each of the portfolios. Our goal has been to increase our overall portfolio occupancy in order to be in a position to drive rental rates. The primary focus in meeting our goal has been to work to improve the Shurgard portfolios overall occupancy level to the occupancy level experienced by our existing portfolio. In order to increase move in volumes and ultimately increase occupancy levels as quickly as possible, we were much more aggressive at reducing our rental rates, increasing promotional discounts and expanding our marketing programs during the fourth quarter of 2006 and continued throughout 2007. We have substantially increased our media advertising expenditures to $25.3 million in 2007, as compared to $17.7 million in 2006 and $13.7 million in 2005. We have made significant progress in improving the occupancy level of the Shurgard portfolio. However, this improvement has come somewhat at the expense of a reduction in the Public Storage Same Store Facilities occupancies and reduced growth in rental rates. We believe that the more aggressive pricing and discounting at the Shurgard properties, combined with the fact that the Shurgard properties had relatively more vacant spaces to rent, has resulted in shifting of new tenant flow not only from our competitors, but also from our existing portfolio to the Shurgard properties during the past year, putting some pressure on the occupancies and rental rate growth for the Public Storage Same Store Facilities. Short term occupancy increases, like those we have experienced in the Shurgard portfolio, tend to result in a higher proportion of short term tenants and a resulting increase in move out ratios, which subsides over time. We believe this is related to the nature of the occupancy stabilization process, which we have observed to have two principal stages first, the physical fill up of the facilities, then the achievement of a stable tenant base with historical levels of move outs, as successive groups of tenants move in, the tenants in such groups with short term needs (such as moving) move out, and the tenants with long term storage needs remain. In addition to our strategy to increase Shurgard occupancies, our operating results have been, and will continue to be, impacted by the general economic trends that affect the self storage business. While it is difficult to quantify the impact of these economic trends, and even more difficult to predict what the impact will be in the future, we do believe that several such factors, including the slowdown in the national housing market, pressure on consumer disposable income, as well as reduced year over year demand in markets which had enhanced self storage demand in 2005 and 2006 due to the hurricanes (such as in Florida), have negatively impacted self storage demand and may continue to do so throughout 2008. Assuming a continuance of recent demand trends that we have observed over the past six months, we expect to continue with aggressive pricing, promotional discounts and marketing in 2008 to maintain or improve our overall occupancy levels. While we increased the number of markets receiving television advertising from 25 markets in the fourth quarter of 2006 to 27 markets in the 41 fourth quarter of 2007, aggregate television spending declined from $7.6 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2006 to $3.3 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2007. Future media advertising expenditures are not determinable at this time, and will be driven in part by demand for our self storage spaces, our current occupancy levels, as well as our evaluation of the most effective mix of yellow page, media, and Internet advertising. We believe that the acquisition of the Shurgard portfolio provided operational efficiencies, specifically in the areas of marketing, national call center, and indirect overhead costs that support the operations of the facilities. We believe that these efficiencies are largely realized and reflected in our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007. DOMESTIC PUBLIC STORAGE SAME STORE FACILITIES The facilities included in the Public Storage Same Store Facilities are all stabilized and have been owned since January 1, 2005 and therefore provide meaningful comparative data for 2005, 2006 and 2007. The Public Storage Same Store Facilities contain approximately 77.8 million net rentable square feet, representing approximately 62% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our consolidated domestic self storage portfolio. Revenues and operating expenses with respect to this group of properties are set forth in the above Self Storage Operations table under the caption, "Same Store Facilities Public Storage." The following table sets forth additional operating data with respect to these facilities: SAME STORE FACILITIES PUBLIC STORAGE Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Percentage Percentage 2007 2006 Change 2006 2005 Change (Dollar amounts in thousands, except weighted average amounts) Rental income...................................... $ 884,379 $ 865,981 2.1% $ 865,981 $ 822,758 5.3% Late charges and administrative fees collected..... 40,709 40,095 1.5% 40,095 37,775 6.1% Total rental income............................. 925,088 906,076 2.1% 906,076 860,533 5.3% Cost of operations before depreciation and amortization: Direct property payroll....................... 63,236 63,945 (1.1)% 63,945 59,717 7.1% Property taxes................................ 85,132 83,262 2.2% 83,262 80,092 4.0% Repairs and maintenance....................... 29,037 29,515 (1.6)% 29,515 27,947 5.6% Advertising and promotion..................... 26,495 26,256 0.9% 26,256 25,115 4.5% Utilities..................................... 21,157 20,459 3.4% 20,459 18,860 8.5% Property insurance............................ 8,835 9,400 (6.0)% 9,400 8,648 8.7% Telephone reservation center.................. 8,549 8,316 2.8% 8,316 8,365 (0.6)% Other cost of management...................... 58,988 58,394 1.0% 58,394 57,901 0.9% Total cost of operations........................ 301,429 299,547 0.6% 299,547 286,645 4.5% Net operating income before depreciation and amortization expense (e)........................... 623,659 606,529 2.8% 606,529 573,888 5.7% Depreciation and amortization expense..............

(c) Annualized rental income per available square foot ("REVPAF") represents annualized rental income, prior to late charges and administrative fees, divided by total available net rentable square feet. (d) In place annual rent per occupied square foot represents annualized contractual rents per occupied square foot without reductions for promotional discounts, and excludes late charges and administrative fees. (e) Total net operating income before depreciation and amortization expense or "NOI" is a non GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure that excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization expense, for our Same Store facilities represents a portion of our total self storage segments net operating income before depreciation and amortization expense, and is reconciled to the segment total in the table "domestic self storage operations summary" above. A reconciliation of our total self storage segments net operating income before depreciation and amortization expense to consolidated net income is included in Note 14 to our December 31, 2007 consolidated financial statements, "Segment Information." Although depreciation and amortization are operating expenses, we believe that NOI is a meaningful measure of operating performance, because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, in determining current property values, segment performance, and comparing period to period and market to market property operating results. NOI is not a substitute for net operating income after depreciation and amortization expense in evaluating our operating results. Rental income increased approximately 2.1% in 2007 as compared to 2006, and 5.3% in 2006 as compared to 2005. These increases were primarily attributable to higher average realized annual rental rates per occupied square foot, which were 2.9% higher in 2007 as compared to 2006, and 5.5% higher in 2006 as compared to 2005. Higher average realized annual rental rates were offset partially by lower occupancy levels. In the first three quarters of 2006, year over year revenue growth was brisk relative to historically experienced growth levels, at 5.9%. Following this period, growth began to slow, with year over year revenue growth of 3.5% for the quarter ended December 31, 2006. In the first three quarters of 2007, revenue growth continued to slow to 2.9% in the quarter ended March 31, 2007, and 1.7% in each of the quarters ended June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2007. Revenue growth improved somewhat in the fourth quarter of 2007 to 2.1%. It is difficult for us to pinpoint the exact reasons for this slow down in revenue growth and the degree to which each factor negatively affected the growth in rental income. We believe, however, that the reduction was due to a number of factors including; (i) the increased number of vacant spaces added to our overall system as a result of the Shurgard Merger and our aforementioned focus on improving the occupancies of the Shurgard portfolio, (ii) hurricane activity that created unusual demand for storage space in our Florida markets in 2005 and 2004, making year over year trends in 2007 less favorable, (iii) general economic conditions, specifically the slow down in housing sales and moving activity, and (iv) increased competition. Many of these factors are beyond our control. As indicated above, it has been our objective to close the occupancy gap between the acquired Shurgard properties versus the Public Storage existing portfolio and achieve a stabilized tenant base. We believe that this strategy has put pressure on occupancies and rental rate growth on our existing Same Store facilities since the merger, as demand appears to have shifted somewhat to the acquired Shurgard facilities as we have adjusted the level of discounts and monthly rents at the acquired Shurgard facilities to accelerate occupancy growth. Because it was important for us to maintain our occupancy levels in the Public Storage Same Store portfolio, we adjusted rental rates and the level of promotional discounts offered to new tenants as a means to expand move in volumes throughout the entire portfolio. It has been challenging to maintain occupancy levels at the Public Storage Same Store group of facilities, while at the same time trying to continue to improve the occupancy levels of the acquired Shurgard facilities and achieve a stabilized tenant base. However, since we believe that we have now closed the occupancy gap between the acquired Shurgard properties versus the Public Storage existing portfolio and have achieved a stabilized tenant base, we expect that the pressure on Public Storage Same Store portfolio should subside. Despite this positive development, the other aforementioned factors noted above may still continue to have a negative impact on our revenue growth, and as a result it is unclear as to when we may achieve higher levels of revenue growth in the Public Storage Same Store pool than we achieved in 2007. 43 Cost of operations (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased by 0.6% in 2007 as compared to 2006, and 4.5% in 2006 as compared to 2005. Growth increased in 2006 due to higher payroll, property tax, utilities, and repairs and maintenance expenses. Growth increased minimally in 2007, because the factors increasing payroll expense in 2006 were somewhat reversed in 2007, and our property tax, utility, and repairs and maintenance expense growth slowed. To a lesser extent, 2007s expenses also benefited from scale efficiencies from the Shurgard Merger. In 2006, we experienced a 7.1% increase in payroll expense as compared to 2005. This growth was driven by higher wage rates due to a tighter labor market in several market areas, higher overtime hours due to understaffing issues, as well as the effects of the Shurgard Merger, with headcount levels increased in order to manage an increased level of turnover stemming from the merger. In 2007, property payroll expense declined 1.1% as many of the inefficiencies such as overtime and increased staffing levels that we experienced in 2006, were eliminated. This was offset partially by higher benefits costs, as we improved the health benefits offered to our property level employees significantly in 2007. For the last few years, we have also benefited from decreased workers compensation costs. For 2008, we expect to incur payroll growth that is higher than inflation, as we do not expect any further declines in payroll hours incurred by our property managers and workers compensation expense should increase as the declines in expense we experienced in the last few years are expected to subside. Property tax expense growth slowed in 2007 as several states (Florida, Texas, and Arizona) passed laws reducing the property tax rates in 2007. While there are states (Indiana, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona) considering new legislation in 2008, nothing has been passed and it is too early to determine any impact on 2008 property tax expense. Therefore, we expect property tax expense growth of approximately 4% in 2008. Repairs and maintenance expense declined 1.6% in 2007 as compared to 2006 but had increased 5.6% in 2006 as compared to 2005. Repairs and maintenance expense include snow removal costs, which totaled $2,297,000, $1,461,000, and $2,209,000, in 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively. Excluding snow removal costs, repairs and maintenance decreased 4.4% in 2007 as compared to 2006 and increased 9.4% in 2006 as compared to 2005. We expect moderated growth in repairs and maintenance in 2008. Advertising and promotion is comprised principally of media (television and radio), yellow page, and Internet advertising. The Public Storage Same Stores pro rata share of advertising and promotion costs increased 0.9% in 2007 as compared to 2006 and 4.5% in 2006 as compared to 2005. Despite significant increases in our aggregate level of media advertising of 42.9% in 2007 and 29.2% in 2006, the Public Storage Same Store properties benefited from the efficiencies of the 487 Shurgard properties added to our portfolio in August 22, 2006, as our aggregate costs were allocated over a larger pool of properties. Utility expenses increased 8.5% in 2006 as compared to 2005, and 3.4% in 2007 as compared to 2006, due principally to fluctuations in electricity and natural gas costs. Future levels of utility expenses will be dependent primarily upon current energy prices and, to a lesser extent, due to changes in demand driven by weather and temperature, both of which are volatile and not predictable. Insurance expense increased 8.7% in 2006 as compared to 2005, and declined 6.0% in 2007 as compared to 2006. The increase in 2006 was due to increases in rates occasioned by the hurricanes that occurred in 2005. The decline in 2007 was likewise market driven, as softer insurance markets in early 2007 as we renewed our premiums effective April 1, 2007, enabled us to receive lower insurance rates. Telephone reservation center costs decreased 0.6% in 2006 as compared to 2005, and increased 2.8% in 2007 as compared to 2006. We continue to evaluate our telephone reservation center as we evaluate the appropriate staffing levels and location of personnel relative to our expanded portfolio, and as a result, expect telephone reservation center costs to remain somewhat volatile during early 2008 until we determine our appropriate ongoing level of expenses. 44 The following table summarizes selected quarterly financial data

Angeles area and San Diego, and has historically been a source of strong growth due to its diverse economy and continued population growth. In addition, barriers to entry in the form of difficult permitting requirements tend to reduce the potential for increased competition in the infill locations where we focus our operations. The Northern California market consists principally of San Francisco and related peripheral areas. While this area has a vibrant economy and relatively strong population growth, it has been subject to general economic conditions, principally issues associated with the technology sector. In addition, there has been increased competition in the areas that we do business, principally in the peripheral areas near San Francisco, due to new supply. As a result, revenue growth in this area has been average relative to our other markets. The Texas market principally includes Dallas, Houston and San Antonio. This market has historically been subject to volatility due to minimal regulatory restraint upon building, which results in cycles of overbuilding and absorption. For the last few years, we have been in a period of increased supply and competition in the areas we operate, and as a result revenue growth has been average relative to other markets. The Florida market principally includes Miami, Orlando, Tampa, and West Palm Beach. Florida has been impacted by the comparative impact of high demand driven by the hurricanes of 2004 and 2005, which resulted in brisk revenue growth in 2006 of 7.6% as compared to 2005. In 2007, since demand is comparatively lower, Floridas revenue has declined 1.8% in 2007 as compared to 2006. Over the longer term, we believe that this market benefits from continued strong population growth and barriers to entry. DOMESTIC SHURGARD SAME STORE FACILITIES In connection with the Shurgard Merger, we acquired 487 self storage facilities in the U.S. located in 23 states. A total of 343 facilities have been operating at a mature stabilized occupancy level for several years under Shurgard management prior to the merger and then under the Public Storage management following the merger. These stabilized facilities are referred to as "Shurgard Same Store Facilities." 47 As reflected in a preceding table entitled "Domestic self storage operations summary" above, the historical operating results for this group of facilities increased significantly for 2007 as compared to 2006 and 2006 as compared to 2005. These increases were primarily the result of having only a partial periods operating results in 2006, from August 23, 2006 (date of the Shurgard Merger) through December 31, 2006, as compared to the entire year ended December 31, 2007. To provide additional comparative operating data, the table below sets forth the operations of the Shurgard Same Store Facilities for the entire periods presented without regard to the timing of the Shurgard Merger. We believe that this presentation more effectively portrays how these facilities are performing, notwithstanding that the data presented for the 2006 and 2005 periods do not represent that actual results included in our operations for those periods.

Included in our consolidated financial statements are only the historical operating results for these facilities from the date of the Shurgard Merger through December 31, 2007, the time that these facilities were owned by us. For comparative purposes, however, the table above includes the historical operating results for these facilities for each of the three years ended December 31, 2007, which includes operations prior to the Shurgard Merger and not included in our consolidated financial statements. (b) Revenues and cost of operations do not include ancillary revenues and expenses generated at the facilities with respect to tenant reinsurance, and retail sales and truck rentals. "Other costs of management" included in cost of operations principally represents all the indirect costs incurred in the operations of the facilities. Indirect costs principally include supervisory costs and corporate overhead cost incurred to support the operating activities of the facilities. These amounts 48 presented herein will not necessarily compare to amounts previously presented by Shurgard in its public reporting due to differences in classification of revenues and expenses, including tenant reinsurance, retail sales and truck rental activities which are included on our income statement under "ancillary operations" but were previously presented by Shurgard as self storage revenue and operating expenses. (c) Net operating income (excluding depreciation) or "NOI" is a non GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure that excludes the impact of depreciation expense. Although depreciation is an operating expense, we believe that NOI is a meaningful measure of operating performance, because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, in determining current property values, segment performance, and comparing period to period and market to market property operating results. NOI is not a substitute for net operating income after depreciation expense in evaluating our operating results. We have not presented depreciation expense for these facilities because the depreciation expense is based upon historical cost, which is substantially different before the merger and after. (d) Square foot occupancies represent weighted average occupancy levels over the entire period. (e) Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by annualizing the result of dividing rental income by the weighted average occupied square footage for the period. Realized annual rent per occupied square foot takes into consideration promotional discounts and other costs that reduce rental income from the contractual amounts due. (f) Annualized rental income per available square foot ("REVPAF") represents annualized rental income divided by total available net rentable square feet. (g) Late charges and administrative fees are excluded from the computation of realized annual rent per occupied square foot and REVPAF because exclusion of these amounts provides a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue, by excluding the volatility of late charges, which are dependent principally upon the level of tenant delinquency, and administrative fees, which are dependent principally upon the absolute level of move ins for a period. (h) In place annual rent per occupied square foot represents annualized contractual rents per occupied square foot without reductions for promotional discounts, and excludes late charges and administrative fees. Reliable data for in place annual rent per occupied square foot as of December 31, 2005 is not available. On the date of the Shurgard Merger, we successfully installed our real time property operation system at all U.S. Shurgard locations. As a result, these facilities were immediately integrated into our national call center, website, and management structure and began to benefit from our operating platform. On August 30, 2006, the occupancy of the Shurgard Same Store facilities was approximately 84.1%, as compared to 91.3% for the Public Storage Same Store facilities. It has been our objective to close this occupancy gap in order to increase REVPAF at the Shurgard facilities. In attempting to accomplish this objective, we significantly expanded our domestic pricing, promotional, and media programs beginning in the fourth quarter of 2006. Revenues for the Shurgard Same Store properties increased 4.7% in 2007 as compared to 2006 and 4.5% in 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase in 2007 is primarily driven by higher occupancy levels as compared to 2006, while the increase in 2006 as compared to 2005 is primarily driven by higher realized rent per occupied square foot. We have improved the occupancy of the Shurgard Same Store Facilities, with average occupancy at December 31, 2007 of 87.6% for the Shurgard Same Store facilities as compared to 88.1% for the Public Storage same store pool. As we have raised the occupancy of the Shurgard Same Store facilities, we have recently been able to be less aggressive on pricing and as a result our trends in realized rent per occupied square foot trends have improved from a reduction of 0.6% in the first nine months of 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006, to a 1.7% increase in the fourth quarter of 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006. Property tax expense increased 11.3% in 2006 as compared to 2005, and 3.6% in 2007 as compared to 2006, due to higher assessments following the Shurgard Merger, particularly with respect to properties in California. Payroll expense decreased from $29,716,000 in 2005, to $28,181,000 in 2006, and to $17,322,000 in 2007. Prior to the Shurgard Merger, Shurgard paid its property managers higher compensation than what we pay our property managers. From the date of the merger until December 31, 2006, the existing Shurgard 49 employees compensation levels were "frozen" at their existing levels. Starting January 1, 2007, the former Shurgard employees who remained had their compensation adjusted to the existing Public Storage compensation levels. Because of this pay disparity and our plan to adjust the former Shurgard employees compensation levels, we expected a significant amount of turnover in the former Shurgard employee ranks following the merger, and as a result we increased the level of "bench" property managers before the merger so that we would have sufficient staffing for the properties. As a result, average pay rates for the property managers staffing the Shurgard properties began declining in Q4 2006, as many of the higher compensated former Shurgard employees left and were replaced with new employees at the Public Storage compensation levels. This decline, however, was offset partially by the impact of increased numbers of bench personnel. Pay rates dropped further on January 1, 2007 as all employees were adjusted to approximate the Public Storage compensation levels. As a result, the compensation levels paid in 2007 approximate the ongoing compensation levels. Overall advertising and promotion increased from $5,148,000 in 2005 to $5,639,000 in 2006 and to $6,840,000 in 2007. As noted previously, we increased advertising and promotional activities immediately following the Shurgard Merger in order to improve the occupancy levels of the facilities acquired in the merger. Shurgard did not employ media advertising and, as a result, there was no media advertising in 2005, as compared to $1,477,000 in 2006 and $3,554,000 in 2007. Yellow page expenditures declined from $3,488,000 in 2005, to $3,027,000 in 2006, to $1,910,000 in 2007. These declines reflect the termination of Shurgards yellow page ads in 2006, and the allocation of the pro rata portion of Public Storages aggregate yellow page expenditures following the Shurgard Merger, which did not increase as a result of the Shurgard Merger. Yellow page expenditure incurred for 2007 approximates the ongoing expected level of yellow page costs. Utility expense increased 8.5% in 2006 as compared to 2005, and 0.7% in 2007 as compared to 2006. Future levels of utility expenses will be dependent primarily upon current energy prices and changes in demand driven by weather and temperature, both of which are volatile and not predictable. Other cost of management, which principally includes supervisory and indirect overhead costs, decreased 9.9% in 2006 as compared to 2005, and 17.1% in 2007 as compared to 2006. These reductions principally represent the synergies created by the merger and the elimination of certain duplicative operating functions. 50 OTHER FACILITIES In addition to the Public Storage and Shurgard Same Store groups of facilities, at December 31, 2007, we had 325 facilities that were not classified into either of these pools. These properties include recently acquired facilities, recently developed facilities and facilities that were recently expanded by adding additional storage units. In general, these facilities are not stabilized with respect to occupancies or rental rates. As a result of the fill up process and timing of when the facilities were put into place, year over year changes can be significant. The following table summarizes operating data with respect to these facilities.

The operations for these 11 facilities from August 23, 2006 through May 24, 2007, combined with the operations of the five facilities that we recommenced consolidation after November 15, 2007, are included in this table. The revenues and expenses, respectively, of these five facilities that we consolidate at December 31, 2007 was $2,063,000 and $965,000, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2007, notwithstanding that only a partial period of operations was included in the table above. (b) Total net operating income before depreciation and amortization or "NOI" is a non GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure that excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization expense, for our self storage facilities represents a portion of our total self storage segments net operating income before depreciation and amortization expense, and is denoted in the table "self storage operations summary" above. A reconciliation of our total self storage segments net operating income before depreciation and amortization expense to consolidated net income is included in Note 14 to our December 31, 2007 consolidated financial statements, "Segment Information." Although depreciation and amortization expense are operating expenses, we believe that NOI is a meaningful measure of operating performance, because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, in determining current property values, segment performance, and comparing period to period and market to market property operating results. NOI is not a substitute for net operating income after depreciation and amortization in evaluating our operating results. (c) Includes 133 facilities acquired in the Shurgard Merger which are not stabilized, as well as 33 other facilities that were acquired or newly developed in 2006. 52 The properties denoted under "Facilities put in place in 2007" and "Facilities put in place in 2006" were put into operation within the Public Storage system at various dates throughout each period presented. Accordingly, rental income, cost of operations, depreciation and amortization, net operating income, weighted average square foot occupancies and realized rents per square foot represent the operating results for the partial period that we owned the facilities during the year acquired. In addition, in place rents per occupied square foot at December 31, 2007 and 2006, reflect the amounts for those facilities we owned at each of those respective dates. In 2007, we acquired seven facilities, in single property transactions, for an aggregate cost of $72,787,000. These facilities contain in aggregate approximately 511,000 net rentable square feet, with one facility located in Hawaii and the remainder in California. In addition, we completed development of three facilities with aggregate square footage of approximately 168,000 and cost of $16,051,000. In 2006, in addition to the facilities we acquired in the Shurgard Merger, we acquired a total of 12 self storage facilities, each in single property transactions. These 12 facilities contain in aggregate approximately 877,000 net rentable square feet and were acquired for an aggregate cost of $103,544,000. These facilities are located in California, Florida, Illinois, New York, Virginia, New Jersey, Delaware, Georgia, and Colorado. Effective January 1, 2006, we commenced consolidating the accounts of three limited partnerships that we had previously accounted for on the equity method, which owned 16 facilities with 879,000 net rentable square feet. We also opened 5 newly developed facilities in 2006. In 2005, we acquired a total of 32 self storage facilities, principally in single property transactions, for an aggregate cost of $254,549,000. These facilities contain in the aggregate approximately 2,390,000 net rentable square feet and are located principally in the Atlanta, Chicago, Miami, and New York metropolitan markets. Effective May 24, 2007, due to a loss in control of the related partnerships that owned these facilities, we began deconsolidating 11 facilities with an aggregate of 624,000 net rentable square feet (referred to hereinafter as "The Deconsolidated Shurgard Properties") that we had originally acquired in the Shurgard Merger. On November 15, 2007, as a result of acquiring a controlling ownership interest, we recommenced consolidating five of these 11 facilities in our operations. The operating results for these facilities are included in the table above for the period each respective facility was consolidated. Our pro rata share of the operating results of the Deconsolidated Shurgard Properties for the periods they were not consolidated are presented in Equity in Earnings of Real Estate Entities. We believe our presence in and knowledge of substantially all of the major markets in the U.S. enhances our ability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities and capitalize on the overall fragmentation in the self storage industry. Our acquisitions consist of facilities that have been operating for a number of years as well as newly constructed facilities that were in the process of filling up to stabilized occupancy levels. In either case, we have been able to leverage off of our operating strategies and improve the occupancy levels of the facilities, or with respect to the newly developed facilities we have been able to accelerate the fill up pace. We expect that our non stabilized facilities will continue to provide earnings growth during 2007 and into 2008 as these facilities continue to improve their occupancy levels as well as realized rental rates. The Expansion facilities represent facilities that have been or are in the process of being expanded in terms of their square footage. We have spent an aggregate of $50,625,000 and $45,300,000 in expanding our facilities in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our level of new development starts has declined significantly in the last few years due to increases in construction cost, increases in competition with retail, condominium, and apartment operators for quality construction sites in urban locations, and more difficult zoning and permitting requirements, which has reduced the number of attractive sites available for development and reduced our development of facilities. It is unclear when, or if, these conditions will improve. 53 EUROPEAN SELF STORAGE OPERATIONS In the Shurgard Merger, we acquired 160 facilities located in seven Western European countries with an aggregate of 8,385,000 net rentable square feet. Since the Shurgard Merger, we opened 15 additional self storage facilities in Europe with an aggregate of 785,000 net rentable square feet. In addition, during 2007, we discontinued a facility (55,000 net rentable square feet) located in France. At December 31, 2007, our European operations comprise 174 facilities with an aggregate of 9,115,000 net rentable square feet, of which, 96 of these facilities are referred to as the Europe Same Store Facilities (defined below). The portfolio consists of 104 facilities are wholly owned facilities and 70 facilities owned by the two joint venture partnerships, in which we have a 20% equity interest. The following table summarizes certain financial data with respect to our self storage operations from the date of the Shurgard Merger (August 23, 2006) through December 31, 2006: Europe self storage operations summary: Year Ended December 31, Percentage 2007 2006 Change (Dollar amounts in thousands) Rental income: Same Store Facilities Shurgard Europe (a). $ 128,278 $ 41,133 211.9% Other wholly owned facilities (b) (c)....... 9,024 3,208 181.3% Joint Venture Facilities (c) (d)............ 56,977 15,122 276.8% Total rental income....................... 194,279 59,463 226.7% Cost of operations before depreciation and amortization expense (e): Same Store Facilities Shurgard Europe..... 51,417 17,303 197.2% Other wholly owned facilities............... 3,523 1,237 184.8% Joint Venture Facilities.................... 37,305 11,610 221.3% Total cost of operations................. 92,245 30,150 206.0% Net operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization expense (e): Same Store Facilities Shurgard Europe..... 76,861 23,830 222.5% Other wholly owned facilities............... 5,501 1,971 179.1% Joint Venture Facilities.................... 19,672 3,512 460.1% Total net operating income before depreciation and amortization expense (e) 102,034 29,313 248.1% Depreciation and amortization expense..........

(b) The other wholly owned facilities include eight facilities that we wholly own, which are not considered European Same Store facilities. (c) Nine facilities were acquired or developed during 2007 for an aggregate of approximately $90,075,000. Our joint ventures own eight of these facilities with aggregate development costs of $81,185,000. (d) The joint ventures, in which we have a 20% equity interest, own 70 facilities which were acquired or developed from 2003 to 2007. (e) Total net operating income before depreciation and amortization expense or "NOI" is a non GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure that excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization expense, for our commercial property segment is presented in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements, "Segment Information," which includes a reconciliation of net operating income before depreciation and amortization expense for this segment to our consolidated net income. Although depreciation and amortization are operating expenses, we believe that NOI is a meaningful measure of operating performance, because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, in determining current property values, segment performance, and comparing period to period and market to market property operating results. NOI is not a substitute for net operating income after depreciation and amortization expense in evaluating our operating results. Amounts presented in the table above reflect significant increases in revenues and cost of operations, in 2007 as compared to 2006, and 2006 as compared to 2005, due to the Shurgard Merger which was completed on August 23, 2006 (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). The operating results of all of the facilities acquired in the merger and located in Europe are included in our financial statements and in the table above for periods after the merger. The Joint Venture opened eight facilities in 2007 with an aggregate development cost of $81,185,000. Revenues and expenses presented in the table above with respect to these properties totaled $869,000 and $2,347,000, respectively. The operating data presented in the table below reflect the historical data through August 22, 2006, the period for which the 96 facilities were operated by Shurgard, combined with the historical data from August 23, 2006 through 55 December 31, 2007, the period operated under Public Storage. In addition, the table utilizes the average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2007, rather than the respective exchange rates in effect for each period. We present this data on such a "constant exchange rate" basis because we believe it allows comparability of the various periods, and isolates the impact of exchange rates with respect to the trends in revenues and cost of operations. As a result, the data presented below does not reflect the actual results included in our operations for 2005, 2006, and 2007. Selected Operating Data for the 96 facilities operated by Shurgard Europe on a stabilized basis since January 1, 2005 ("Europe Same Store Facilities"): (a) Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, Percentage Percentage 2007 2006 Change 2006 2005 Change (Dollar amounts in thousands, except weighted average data, utilizing constant exchange rates) (b) Revenues: Rental income................................. $ 127,001 $ 116,260 9.2% $ 116,260 $ 103,040 12.8% Late charges and administrative fees collected 1,277 1,127 13.3% 1,127 963 17.0% Total revenues (c)............................ 128,278 117,387 9.3% 117,387 104,003 12.9% Cost of operations (excluding depreciation and amortization expense): Property taxes ............................... 5,746 5,352 7.4% 5,352 4,975 7.6% Direct property payroll....................... 15,035 16,614 (9.5)% 16,614 15,294 8.6% Advertising and promotion..................... 4,050 5,832 (30.6)% 5,832 7,639 (23.7)% Utilities..................................... 2,986 3,229 (7.5)% 3,229 3,024 6.8% Repairs and maintenance....................... 3,373 3,602 (6.4)% 3,602 3,540 1.8% Property insurance............................ 1,213 1,564 (22.4)% 1,564 1,658 (5.7)% Other costs of operations..................... 19,014 18,746 1.4% 18,746 22,119 (15.2)% Total cost of operations (c).................... 51,417 54,939 (6.4)% 54,939 58,249 (5.7)% Net operating income (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) (d)...................... $ 76,861 $ 62,448 23.1% $ 62,448 $ 45,754 36.5% Gross margin (before depreciation and amortization expense).......................................... 59.9% 53.2% 12.6% 53.2% 44.0% 20.9% Weighted average for the period: Square foot occupancy (e)....................... 89.8% 85.2% 5.4% 85.2% 78.5% 8.5% Realized annual rent per occupied square foot (f) $26.75 $25.81 3.6% $25.81 $24.83 3.9% REVPAF (g) (h).................................. $24.03 $21.99 9.3% $21.99 $19.49 12.8% Weighted average at December 31: Square foot occupancy........................... 89.0% 89.1% (0.1)% 89.1% 82.2% 8.4% In place annual rent per occupied square foot (i) $30.95 $28.68 7.9% $28.68 $27.94 2.6% Total net rentable square feet (in thousands)..... 5,286 5,286 5,286 5,286 (a) We acquired the Shurgard Europe Same Store facilities in connection with the Shurgard Merger which was completed on August 22, 2006. Included in our consolidated financial statements are only the historical operating results for these facilities from the date of the Shurgard Merger through December 31, 2007, the time that these facilities were owned by us. For comparative purposes, however, the table above includes the historical operating results for these facilities for each of the three years ended December 31, 2007, which includes operations prior to the Shurgard Merger and not included in our consolidated financial statements. (b) The majority of our European operations are denominated in Euros. For comparative purposes, amounts for 2005, 2006, and 2007 are translated at constant exchange rates representing the average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2007. The average exchange rate for the Euro was approximately 1.3698 during 2007. The amounts that are included in our consolidated financial statements are based upon the actual exchange rate for each period. (c) Revenues and cost of operations do not include ancillary revenues and expenses generated at the facilities with respect to tenant reinsurance and retail sales. "Other costs of management" included in cost of operations principally represents all the indirect costs incurred in the operations of the facilities. Indirect costs principally include supervisory costs and corporate overhead cost incurred to support the operating activities of the facilities. 56 (d) Net operating income (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) or "NOI" is a non GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure that excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization expense. Although depreciation and amortization are operating expenses, we believe that NOI is a meaningful measure of operating performance, because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, in determining current property values, segment performance, and comparing period to period and market to market property operating results. NOI is not a substitute for net operating income after depreciation and amortization expense in evaluating our operating results. We have not presented depreciation and amortization expense for these facilities because the depreciation and amortization expense is based upon historical cost, which is substantially different before the merger and after. (e) Square foot occupancies represent weighted average occupancy levels over the entire period. (f) Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by annualizing the result of dividing rental income by the weighted average occupied square footage for the period. Realized annual rent per occupied square foot takes into consideration promotional discounts and other costs that reduce rental income from the contractual amounts due. (g) Annualized rental income per available square foot ("REVPAF") represents annualized rental income divided by total available net rentable square feet. (h) Late charges and administrative fees are excluded from the computation of realized annual rent per occupied square foot and REVPAF because exclusion of these amounts provides a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue, by excluding the volatility of late charges, which are dependent principally upon the level of tenant delinquency, and administrative fees, which are dependent principally upon the absolute level of move ins for a period. (i) In place annual rent per occupied square foot represents annualized contractual rents per occupied square foot without reductions for promotional discounts, and excludes late charges and administrative fees. The Europe Same Store properties continue to reflect above average growth. With occupancy stabilized at above 90%, we believe we have pricing power and expect to generate additional growth through rental rate increases. The properties are also benefiting from expense control, resulting in negative expense growth. The European team is selectively adapting various operating strategies we use in the U.S. and incorporating them into their operating model.

Revenues are comprised of fees charged to tenants electing such policies. Cost of operations primarily includes claims paid that are not covered by our outside third party insurers, as well as claims adjusting expenses. The significant increase in tenant reinsurance operations is due primarily to the increase in properties associated with the Shurgard Merger. In 2007 and 2006, respectively, tenant insurance revenues included $9,560,000 and $3,243,000 with respect to the Shurgard facilities in the U.S. and $9,605,000 and $2,731,000, respectively, in tenant insurance revenues with respect to facilities in Europe. 59 Further contributing to our increase in tenant reinsurance revenues were higher rates, and an increase in the percentage of our existing tenants retaining such policies, with respect to our ongoing tenant insurance activities in the U.S. Approximately 45.5%, 35.1%, and 32.4% of our tenants had such policies during 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The future level of tenant reinsurance revenues is largely dependent upon the number of new tenants electing to purchase policies, the level of premiums charged for such insurance, and the number of tenants that continue participating in the insurance program. The future cost of operations will be dependent primarily upon the level of losses incurred, including the level of catastrophic events, such as hurricanes, that occur and affect our properties. MERCHANDISE AND TRUCK RENTAL OPERATIONS: Our subsidiaries sell locks, boxes, and packing supplies to our tenants as well as the general public. Revenues and cost of operations for these activities are included in the table above as "Merchandise Sales." In addition, at selected locations in the U.S., our subsidiaries maintain trucks on site for rent to our self storage customers and the general public on a short term basis for local use. In addition, we also act as an agent for a national truck rental company to provide their rental trucks to customers for long distance use. The revenues and cost of operations for these activities are included in the table above as "Truck rentals." These activities generally serve as an adjunct to our self storage operations providing our tenants with goods and services that they need in connection with moving and storing their goods. The primary factor impacting the level of operations of these activities is the level of customer traffic at our self storage facilities, including the level of move ins. The significant increase in merchandise revenues is due primarily to the increase in properties associated with the Shurgard Merger. In 2007 and 2006, respectively, merchandise revenues included $8,477,000 and $2,674,000 with respect to the Shurgard facilities in the United States; and $7,963,000 and $2,390,000, respectively, in merchandise revenues with respect to Shurgard Europe. In 2007 and 2006, respectively, truck revenues included $1,694,000 and $795,000 with respect to the Shurgard facilities in the U.S. CONTAINERIZED STORAGE OPERATIONS: We have containerized storage facilities located in eight densely populated markets with above average rent and income. Rental and other income includes monthly rental charges to customers for storage of the containers, service fees charged for pickup and delivery of containers to customers homes and businesses and certain non core services which were eliminated, such as handling and packing customers goods from city to city. Direct operating costs principally includes payroll, equipment lease expense, utilities and vehicle expenses (fuel and insurance). We closed certain containerized storage locations; the results of these facilities for all periods presented have been reclassified to the line item "discontinued operations." There can be no assurance as to the level of the containerized storage businesss expansion, level of gross rentals, level of move outs or profitability. We continue to evaluate the businesss operations, based on which we have closed certain of these facilities in recent years, and we may decide to close additional facilities in the future. COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OPERATIONS: Commercial property operations included in our consolidated financial statements include commercial space owned by the Company and entities consolidated by the Company. We have a much larger interest in commercial properties through our ownership interest in PSB. Our investment in PSB is accounted for using the equity method of accounting, and accordingly our share of PSBs earnings is reflected as "Equity in earnings of real estate entities," below. 60 Our commercial operations are comprised of 1,455,000 net rentable square feet of commercial space, which is principally operated at certain of the self storage facilities. The significant increase in commercial property revenues is due principally to commercial space in the facilities we acquired in the Shurgard Merger in the U.S. Our commercial property operations consist primarily of facilities that are at a stabilized level of operations, and generally reflect the conditions in the markets in which they operate. We do not expect any significant growth in net operating income from this segment of our business for 2008. EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF REAL ESTATE ENTITIES: In addition to our ownership of equity interests in PSB, we had general and limited partnership interests in five limited partnerships at December 31, 2007 (PSB and the limited partnerships are collectively referred to as the "Unconsolidated Entities"). Due to our limited ownership interest and limited control of these entities, we do not consolidate the accounts of these entities for financial reporting purposes, and account for such investments using the equity method. Equity in earnings of real estate entities for the year ended December 31, 2007 consists of our pro rata share of the Unconsolidated Entities based upon our ownership interest for the period. The following table sets forth the significant components of equity in earnings of real estate entities: Historical summary: Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Change 2006 2005 Change (Amounts in thousands) Property operations: PSB $ 82,279 $ 73,850 $ 8,429 $ 73,850 $ 68,768 $ 5,082 Consistent investments (1)............. 3,322 3,256 66 3,256 2,951 305 Other Investments (2).................. 1,556 1,556 5,229 (5,229) 87,157 77,106 10,051 77,106 76,948 158 Depreciation: PSB....................................

(2) On January 1, 2006, we commenced consolidating the accounts of three limited partnerships that we had previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, equity in income with respect to these partnerships ceased effective January 1, 2006. In addition, as described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, we deconsolidated certain investments in limited partnerships owning 11 properties effective May 24, 2007, and equity in earnings with respect to these partnerships commenced effective May 24, 2007. We subsequently acquired interests in certain of these deconsolidated partnerships owning five properties and recommenced consolidating these interests effective November 17, 2007. (3) "Other" reflects our share of general and administrative expense, interest expense, interest income, and other non property; non depreciation related operating results of these entities. 61 (4) "Other" with respect to PSB also includes our pro rata share of gains on sale of real estate assets, impairment charges relating to pending sales of real estate and the impact of PSBs application of the SECs clarification of EITF Topic D 42 on redemptions of preferred securities. Our investment in PSB has remained consistent throughout the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005). Throughout 2005, 2006 and 2007, we owned 5,418,273 common shares and 7,305,355 operating partnership units (units which are convertible into common shares on a one for one basis) in PSB. At December 31, 2007, PSB owned and operated 19.6 million net rentable square feet of commercial space located in eight states. PSB also manages commercial space owned by the Company and affiliated entities at December 31, 2007 pursuant to property management agreements. Our future equity income from PSB will be dependent entirely upon PSBs operating results. Our investment in PSB provides us with some diversification into another asset type. We have no plans of disposing of our investment in PSB. PSBs filings and selected financial information can be accessed through the Securities and Exchange Commission, and on its website, www.psbusinessparks.com. The "Consistent Investments" are comprised primarily of our equity in earnings from four limited partnerships, as well as our equity in earnings of two properties owned by the Acquisition Joint Venture as described more fully in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. We held an approximate consistent level of equity interest throughout 2005, 2006, and 2007. The Company formed the four limited partnerships during the 1980s and is the general partner of these partnerships, and we entered into the Acquisition Joint Venture in 2004. We manage each of these facilities for a management fee that is included in "Ancillary operations." The limited partners of the four partnerships consist of numerous individual investors, including the Company, which throughout the 1990s acquired units of limited partnership interests in these limited partnerships in various transactions. Our future earnings with respect to the "Consistent Investments" will be dependent upon the operating results of the 22 self storage facilities that these entities own. The operating characteristics of these facilities are similar to those of the Companys self storage facilities, and are subject to the same operational issues as the Same Store Facilities as discussed above. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for the operating results of these entities for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005. OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE ITEMS INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME: Interest and other income was $11,417,000 in 2007, $31,799,000 in 2006, and $16,447,000 in 2005. Interest and other income has decreased in 2007 as compared to 2006 principally as a result of lower cash balances invested in interest bearing accounts, offset by slightly higher interest rates. Interest and other income increased in 2006 as compared to 2005 principally as a result of higher average cash balances invested in interest bearing accounts at higher interest rates. The changes in average cash balances are primarily due to the timing of investing retained cash into real estate assets; in the case of 2006, we had significant cash balances from proceeds from preferred equity issuances completed in anticipation of the Shurgard Merger. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION: Depreciation and amortization expense was $622,410,000, $437,568,000 and $196,153,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increases in depreciation and amortization expense in 2007 and 2006 are due primarily to the amortization of intangibles acquired primarily in the Shurgard Merger totaling $247,844,000 in 2007 and $175,944,000 in 2006. These intangible assets represent the value of the storage tenants in place at the time of the merger, and are being amortized relative to the expected future benefit of the tenants in place to each period. These increases also reflect depreciation of the buildings acquired in the Shurgard Merger, totaling approximately $142,800,000 in 2007 and $61,703,000 in 2006. In addition, we acquired and opened for operations additional self storage facilities in 2005, 2006, and 2007, resulting in increased depreciation expense of the buildings of these facilities. Depreciation expense in 2007 with respect to facilities acquired or opened for operations in 2007 totaled $2,206,000. We expect the depreciation expense with respect to these facilities to approximate $4,361,000 in 2008. 62 GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE: General and administrative expense was $59,749,000, $84,661,000, and $21,115,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 respectively. General and administrative expense principally consists of state income taxes, investor relations expenses, and corporate and executive salaries. In addition, general and administrative expenses includes expenses that vary depending on the Companys activity levels in certain areas, such as overhead associated with the acquisition and development of real estate facilities, certain expenses related to capital raising and merger and acquisition activities, employee severance, and stock based compensation. General and administrative expense includes the following items that vary depending upon our activities: a) costs and expenses totaling $5,300,000 and $44,010,000, respectively, during 2007 and 2006, incurred in connection with the integration of Shurgard and Public Storage b) costs for cancelled development projects in the U.S. and Europe totaling $2,120,000 and $10,211,000 in 2007 and 2006, respectively; c) $9,600,000 related to our proposed offering of shares in our European business in 2007; d) $2,019,000 associated with our reorganization as a Maryland REIT in 2007; e) $1,900,000 in additional incentive compensation in 2007; and f) contract termination fees of $2,213,000 in 2006. In addition, with the Shurgard Merger, we began to incur general and administrative expense relating to the management and administration of the European operations, which are operated under a separate management team. Restricted stock and stock option expense amounted to approximately $8,511,000, $6,309,000, and $4,758,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. INTEREST EXPENSE: Interest expense was $63,671,000, $33,062,000, and $8,216,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increases in interest expense in 2006 and 2007 are primarily due to $24,855,000 and $58,656,000 in interest incurred on the debt and other obligations we assumed in the Shurgard Merger. See also Notes 7 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements for a schedule of our debt balances, principal repayment requirements, and average interest rates. Capitalized interest expense totaled $4,746,000, $2,716,000, and $2,820,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in connection with our development activities. Included in the interest capitalized for 2007 and 2006 is $2,710,000 and $935,000, respectively, in connection with our development activities in Europe. GAIN ON DISPOSITION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS: During 2007, 2006, and 2005 we have recorded gains on sale of assets, principally partial condemnations and other disposals of real estate facilities, totaling $1,354,000, $2,177,000, and $3,099,000, respectively, in 2007, 2006, and 2005. In addition, on May 14, 2007, one of our European subsidiaries sold limited liability partner interests ("LLP Interests") it held in Shurgard Self Storage SCA ("Shurgard Europe"), also an indirect subsidiary of Public Storage, to various officers of the Company other than our chief executive officer. The aggregate proceeds of the sale were $4,909,000. The sale price for the LLP Interests was the net asset value per LLP Interest using, among other items, information provided by an independent third party appraisal firm of the net asset value of Shurgard Europe as of March 31, 2007. In connection with the sale of these LLP Interests, we recorded a gain of $1,193,000 during 2007, representing the excess of the sales proceeds less the book value of the LLP Interests sold. The gain is reflected in gain on disposition of real estate investments in our accompanying consolidated statements of income. FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAIN: At December 31, 2007, our European subsidiaries owed approximately (euro)377.7 million ($555.9 million as of December 31, 2007) to our domestic subsidiaries. The loans are eliminated in consolidation for financial reporting purposes. We expect our European subsidiaries to obtain external financing in the next 12 to 24 months, which will fund the repayment of 63 the loans. The loans, which are denominated in Euros, have not been hedged. The amount of US dollars that will be received on repayment will depend upon the exchange rates at the time. Based upon the change in estimated US dollars to be received caused by fluctuation in currency rates during 2007, foreign currency translation gains of $57.6 million were recorded in 2007. The U.S. Dollar exchange rate relative to the Euro was approximately 1.319 and 1.472 at December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively. Future foreign exchange gains or losses will be dependent primarily upon the movement of the Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar, the level of our intercompany debt and our continued expectation with respect to repaying intercompany debt. HURRICANE CASUALTY GAIN OR LOSS: Our policy is to record casualty losses or gains in the period the casualty occurs equal to the differential between (a) the book value of assets destroyed and (b) insurance proceeds, if any, that we expect to receive in accordance with our insurance contracts. Potential insurance proceeds that are subject to uncertainties, such as interpretation of deductible provisions of the governing agreements or the estimation of costs of restoration, are treated as a contingent proceeds in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5 ("SFAS 5"), and not recorded until the uncertainties are satisfied. During 2007, we recorded a casualty gain totaling $2,665,000, representing the realization of such contingent proceeds relating to hurricanes which occurred in 2005. During 2005, we recorded a casualty loss of $1,917,000 related to damage to our properties from hurricanes. INCOME FROM DERIVATIVES, NET: This represents the net gain or loss as recognized for the changes in the fair market values of those derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133, combined with net payments from derivative instruments. We recognized net income of $851,000 and $3,926,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease in income in 2006 is due to the extinguishment of certain derivatives on January 2, 2007 and, as a result, no further gains or losses or net payments resulted for these derivatives. We do not expect any significant activity in these derivatives in 2008. MINORITY INTEREST IN INCOME: Minority interest in income represents the income that is allocable to equity interests in the Consolidated Entities, which are not owned by the Company. The following table summarizes minority interest in income for each of the three years ended December 31, 2007: Year Ended December 31 Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Change 2006 2005 Change (Amounts in thousands) Preferred partnership interests (a).......... $ 21,612 $ 19,055 $ 2,557 $ 19,055 $ 17,021 $ 2,034 Newly consolidated partnerships (b).......... 5,507 5,259 248 5,259 5,259 Shurgard European minority interests (c)..... (9,389) (3,631) (5,758) (3,631) (3,631) Other minority interests (d)................. 11,813 11,200 613 11,200 15,630 (4,430) Total minority interests in income....... $ 29,543 $ 31,883 $ (2,340) $ 31,883 $ 32,651 $ (768) (a) The increase in preferred partnership interests is primarily due to the issuance of additional preferred partnership units offset by the redemption of $40,000,000 of our 9.5% Series N Preferred Units on March 17, 2005 and $45,000,000 of our 9.125% Series O Preferred units on March 29, 2005. (b) These amounts reflect income allocated to minority interests for three entities that we commenced consolidating the accounts for effective January 1, 2006 (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements). Included in minority interest in income for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $108,000 and $132,000 in depreciation expense. (c) These amounts reflect income allocated to minority interests from entities we acquired in the Shurgard Merger. These interests include the 80% partners interests in the European joint ventures, First Shurgard and Second Shurgard, as well as those in domestic joint ventures. Included in minority interest in income is $11,513,000 and $3,013,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 in depreciation expense. (d) The other minority interest include depreciation expense of $2,437,000, $1,339,000, and $3,152,000, respectively, for 2007, 2006, and 2005. The level of income allocated to these interests in the future is dependent upon the operating results of the storage facilities that these entities own, as well as any minority interests that the Company acquires in the future. 64 Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our internally generated net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to meet our operating expenses, capital improvements, debt service requirements and distributions requirements to shareholders for the foreseeable future. Operating as a REIT, our ability to retain cash flow for reinvestment is restricted. In order for us to maintain our REIT status, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow must be used to make distributions to our shareholders (see "Requirement to Pay Distributions" below). However, despite the significant distribution requirements, we have been able to retain a significant amount of our operating cash flow. The following table summarizes our ability to fund distributions to the minority interests, capital improvements to maintain our facilities, and distributions to our shareholders through the use of cash provided by operating activities. The remaining cash flow generated is available to make both scheduled and optional principal payments on debt and for reinvestment. For the Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (Amount in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities (a)......................... $ 1,013,204 $ 775,400 $ 673,871 Allocable to minority interests (Preferred Units).....................

(340,002) (298,219) (244,200) Cash available for principal payments on debt and reinvestment........ $ 324,307 $ 143,158 $ 193,174 (a) Represents net cash provided from operating activities for each respective year as presented in our December 31, 2007 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. (b) Cash available for principal payments on debt and reinvestment is not a substitute for cash flows from operations in our liquidity, ability to repay our debt, or to meet our distribution requirements. Cash available for principal payments on debt and reinvestment increased from $143.2 million in 2006 to $324.3 million in 2007 principally due to a significant increase in our self storage operations, primarily as a result of the Shurgard Merger, as well as additional tax depreciation with respect to the assets acquired in the Shurgard Merger which serves to reduce our taxable income and required distributions requirements. Our financial profile is characterized by a low level of debt to total capitalization and a conservative dividend payout ratio with respect to the common shares. We expect to fund our growth strategies and debt obligations with (i) cash on hand at December 31, 2007, (ii) internally generated retained cash flows and (iii) proceeds from issuing equity securities. In general, our current strategy is to continue to finance our growth with permanent capital, either common or preferred equity. Over the past three years, we have funded substantially all of our acquisitions with permanent capital (both common and preferred securities). We have elected to use preferred securities as a form of leverage despite the fact that the dividend rates of our preferred securities exceed the prevailing market interest rates on conventional debt. We have chosen this method of financing for the following reasons: (i) under the REIT structure, a significant amount of operating cash flow needs to be distributed to our shareholders, making it difficult to repay debt with operating cash flow alone, (ii) our perpetual preferred shares have no sinking fund requirement or maturity date and do not require redemption, all of which eliminate any future refinancing risks, (iii) after the end of a non call period, we have the option to redeem the preferred 65 shares at any time, which enable us to refinance higher coupon preferred shares with new preferred shares at lower rates if appropriate, (iv) preferred shares do not contain covenants, thus allowing us to maintain significant financial flexibility, and (v) dividends on the preferred shares can be applied to satisfy our REIT distribution requirements. Our credit ratings on each of our series of preferred shares are "Baa1" by Moodys and "BBB+" by Standard & Poors. On March 27, 2007, we entered into a five year revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with an aggregate limit with respect to borrowings, letters of credit and foreign currency borrowings in Euros or British pounds of $300 million. Amounts drawn under the Credit Agreement bear an annual interest rate ranging from the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 0.35% to LIBOR plus 1.00% depending on our credit ratings (LIBOR plus 0.35% at December 31, 2007). In addition, we are required to pay a quarterly facility fee ranging from 0.10% per annum to 0.25% per annum depending on our credit ratings (0.10% per annum at December 31, 2007). We had no outstanding borrowings on our Credit Agreement at December 31, 2007 or February 28, 2008. At December 31, 2007, we had undrawn standby letters of credit, which reduce our borrowing capacity with respect to our line of credit by the amount of the standby letters of credit, totaling $20.4 million. The Credit Agreement includes various covenants, the more significant of which require us to (i) maintain a leverage ratio (as defined therein) of less than 0.55 to 1.00, (ii) maintain certain fixed charge and interest coverage ratios (as defined therein) of not less than 1.5 to 1.0 and 1.75 to 1.0, respectively, and (iii) maintain a minimum total shareholders equity (as defined therein). We were in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Agreement at December 31, 2007. RECENT ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED SHARES AND PROJECTED REDEMPTION OF PREFERRED SECURITIES: One of our financing objectives over the past several years has been to reduce our average cost of capital with respect to our preferred securities. Accordingly, we have redeemed higher rate preferred securities outstanding and have financed the redemption with cash on hand or from the proceeds from the issuance of lower rate preferred securities. We believe that our size and financial flexibility enables us to access capital when appropriate. Since the beginning of 2005 through December 31, 2007, we have raised approximately $2.6 billion of preferred securities, and used approximately $1.2 billion of these net proceeds in order to redeem higher coupon preferred securities. Over the past several months, accessing capital through the credit markets has become very difficult, in part due to the lack of liquidity. At December 31, 2007, our 7.500% Series V Cumulative Preferred Shares ($172.5 million) were redeemable at our option; however, we have not called these shares for redemption. In addition, in October 2008 our 6.500% Series W Cumulative Preferred Shares ($132.5 million), and in November 2008 our 6.450% Series X Cumulative Preferred Shares ($120.0 million) become available for redemption at our option. It is not advantageous to redeem these shares at this time because, based upon current market conditions, we cannot issue additional preferred securities at a lower coupon rate than the securities that would be called. The timing of redemption of any of these series of preferred shares will depend upon many factors including when, or if, market conditions improve such that we can issue new preferred shares at a lower cost of capital than the shares that would be redeemed. In the past we have typically raised additional capital in advance of the redemption dates to ensure that we have available funds to redeem these securities. Provided market conditions improve in the future, we may raise capital in advance to fund redemptions. REQUIREMENT TO PAY DISTRIBUTIONS: We have operated, and intend to continue to operate, in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT under the Code, but no assurance can be given that we will at all times so qualify. To the extent that the Company continues to qualify as a REIT, we will not be taxed, with certain limited exceptions, on the taxable income that is distributed to our shareholders, provided that at least 90% of our taxable income is so distributed to our shareholders. We believe we have satisfied the REIT distribution requirement since 1981. Aggregate dividends paid during 2007 totaled $236.7 million to the holders of our Cumulative Preferred Shares, $340.0 million to the holders of our common shares and $21.4 million to the holders of our Equity Shares, Series A. Although we have not finalized the calculation of our 2007 taxable income, we believe that the aggregate dividends paid in 2007 to our shareholders enable us to continue to meet our REIT distribution requirements. 66 During 2007, we paid distributions totaling $21.6 million with respect to our Preferred Partnership Units. We estimate the 2008 distribution requirements with respect to the preferred partnership units outstanding at December 31, 2007, to be approximately $21.6 million. In addition, we estimate the 2008 distribution requirements with respect to our preferred shares outstanding at December 31, 2007, to be approximately $241.3 million, assuming no additional preferred share issuances or redemptions during 2008. For 2008, distributions with respect to the common shares and Equity Shares, Series A will be determined based upon our REIT distribution requirements after taking into consideration distributions to the preferred shareholders. We anticipate that, at a minimum, quarterly distributions per common share for 2008 will be $0.55 per common share. For the first quarter of 2008, a quarterly distribution of $0.55 per common share has been declared by our Board, representing a 10% increase from our previous dividend of $0.50 per common share. With respect to the depositary shares representing the Equity Shares, Series A, we have no obligation to pay distributions if no distributions are paid to the common shareholders. To the extent that we do pay common distributions in any year, the holders of the depositary shares receive annual distributions equal to the lesser of (i) five times the per share dividend on the common shares or (ii) $2.45. The depositary shares are non cumulative, and have no preference over our Common Shares either as to dividends or in liquidation. CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT REQUIREMENTS: During 2008, we have budgeted approximately $92 million for capital improvements for our facilities. Capital improvements include major repairs or replacements to the facilities, which keep the facilities in good operating condition and maintain their visual appeal. Capital improvements do not include costs relating to the development or expansion of facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we incurred capital improvements of approximately $69.1 million. EUROPEAN ACTIVITIES: As we previously disclosed, we attempted to liquidate a portion of our investment in our European subsidiaries through an initial public offering, and although market conditions are not favorable at this time for such a transaction, we continue to evaluate our alternatives and still believe that a public entity is the best structure for our European operations long term growth. At December 31, 2007, our European subsidiaries owed approximately (euro)377.7 million ($555.9 million as of December 31, 2007) to our domestic subsidiaries. We expect our European subsidiaries to obtain external financing in the next 12 to 24 months, which will fund the repayment of the loan, resulting in the receipt of additional cash. The loans, which are denominated in Euros, have not been hedged to limit our exposure to fluctuation in exchange rates between the Euro and the U.S. Dollar; as a result, the amount of U.S. Dollars that will be received on repayment will depend upon exchange rates at the time. As disclosed in January 2008, we reached an agreement in principle for a prospective investor to acquire a 51% interest in Shurgard Europe in a private transaction at a price generally consistent with the previously disclosed proceeds Public Storage expected to receive for its equity interest in last years terminated European share offering. No binding agreement has been signed with the prospective investor and there is no assurance that a binding agreement will be signed or that the transaction will be completed. We estimate completion of the transaction at the end of the first quarter of 2008 assuming a binding agreement is signed and the conditions related to the transaction are satisfied. DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS: At December 31, 2007, we have total outstanding debt of approximately $1.1 billion. We do not believe we have any significant refinancing risks with respect to our debt. In connection with the Shurgard Merger, we assumed approximately $2.0 billion of debt from Shurgard and its affiliates. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $945.2 million of such debt remains outstanding. In late December 2006, we entered into a short term unsecured bridge loan with a commercial bank for borrowings up to $300 million and immediately borrowed the entire amount, increasing our cash balances to $555.6 million as of December 31, 2006. A substantial portion of this cash was utilized on January 2, 2007, to retire approximately $429 million of debt assumed from Shurgard that was secured by substantially all of our wholly owned facilities in Europe. The bridge loan was subsequently repaid and terminated on January 10, 2007 with the proceeds from the issuance of preferred securities. 67 Our portfolio of real estate facilities remains substantially unencumbered. At December 31, 2007, we have domestic mortgage debt outstanding of $236.9 million, which encumbers 88 self storage facilities with an aggregate net book value of approximately $601.2 million. In Europe, our joint ventures (in which we have a 20% ownership interest) had mortgage debt at December 31, 2007 totaling $376.7 million, which encumbers 68 facilities with an aggregate net book value of approximately $538.9 million at December 31, 2007. We anticipate that our retained operating cash flow will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make scheduled principal payments. See Notes 7 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements for approximate principal maturities of such borrowings. It is our current intention to fully amortize our outstanding debt as opposed to refinance debt maturities with additional debt. Alternatively, we may prepay debt and finance such prepayments with retained operating cash flow or proceeds from the issuance of preferred securities. Approximately $189.1 million in debt owed by First Shurgard was originally scheduled to mature in May 2008. However, in February 2008, under the terms of the related credit agreement we have requested a one year extension of the loan until May 2009. Assuming we have met our loan covenants, which we believe we have met, the lender is required to grant our request. Notwithstanding our expectation of receiving the requested one year extension, if the extension is not granted, we and our joint venture partner are required to contribute our pro rata share of funds necessary to repay the debt. We believe that our joint venture partner has the intention and ability to contribute their potential 80% share towards repayment of this debt if it is necessary. Concurrent with the completion of the proposed transaction for a prospective investor to acquire a 51% ownership interest in Shurgard Europe, we will seek to obtain a waiver from the lenders of the Second Shurgard credit facility for the change in control acceleration clause contained in the credit facility. See Note 19 to our December 31, 2007 financial statements for further information regarding the proposed transaction involving Shurgard Europe. ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT OF FACILITIES: During 2008, we will continue to seek to acquire additional self storage facilities from third parties; however, it is difficult to estimate the amount of third party acquisitions we will undertake. At December 31, 2007, we have a development "pipeline" of 29 projects in the U.S. and 14 projects in Europe, consisting of newly developed self storage facilities, conversion of space at facilities that was previously used for containerized storage and expansions to existing self storage facilities. At December 31, 2007, we have acquired the land for all of the U.S. projects and seven of the projects in Europe. The development and fill up of these storage facilities is subject to significant contingencies such as obtaining appropriate governmental approvals. We estimate that the amount remaining to be spent to complete development to be approximately $190.7 million and will be incurred over the next 24 months. The following table sets forth certain information with respect to our development pipeline. DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE SUMMARY AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 Total Number Net estimated Costs incurred of rentable development through Costs to projects sq. ft. cost 12/31/07 complete (Amounts in thousands, except number of projects) U.S. under construction 6 337 $ 39,032 $ 23,302 $ 15,730 U.S. in development, land acquired 23 881 88,105 5,072 83,033 European projects in construction 7 373 61,091 30,327 30,764 European projects under development 7 363 62,790 1,623 61,167 Total Development Pipeline 43 1,954 $ 251,018 $ 60,324 $ 190,694 The development and fill up of these storage facilities is subject to significant contingencies such as obtaining appropriate governmental approvals. We estimate that the amount remaining to be spent to complete development will be incurred over the next 24 months. Substantially all of the future costs for the seven European projects that are in construction will be funded by the Shurgard European Joint Ventures, in which we have a 20% interest, and which have a substantial degree of funding by debt. The future costs with respect to all other development projects will be funded by us. 68 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2007 and their impact on our cash flows and liquidity are summarized below for the years ending December 31 (amounts in thousands): Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Long term debt (1) ............ $1,204,818 $ 268,563 $ 240,915 $ 48,218 $ 249,875 $ 73,870 $ 323,377 Capital leases (2)............. 44,434 792 807 749 1,453 700 39,933 Operating leases (3)........... 264,875 20,394 16,197 12,053 10,658 10,202 195,371 Construction commitments (4)... 46,494 37,230 9,264 Total.......................... $1,560,621 $ 326,979 $ 267,183 $ 61,020 $ 261,986 $ 84,772 $ 558,681 (1) Amounts include interest payments on our notes payable based on their contractual terms. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our notes payable. Debt to Joint Venture Partner is not reflected since we have not exercised our option to acquire our partners interest. Approximately $189.1 million in debt owed by First Shurgard was originally scheduled to mature in May 2008. However, in February 2008, under the terms of the related credit agreement we have requested a one year extension of the loan until May 2009. Assuming we have met our loan covenants, which we believe we have met, the lender is required to grant our request. (2) This line item reflects amounts due on five European properties with commitments extending to April 2052 that we assumed in the Shurgard Merger. (3) We lease trucks, land, equipment and office space under various operating leases. Certain leases are cancelable with substantial penalties. (4) Includes obligations for facilities currently under construction at December 31, 2007 as described above under "Acquisition and Development of Facilities." In January 2004, we entered into a joint venture partnership with an institutional investor for the purpose of acquiring up to $125,000,000 of existing self storage properties in the U.S. from third parties (the "Acquisition Joint Venture"). As described more fully in Note 8 to our December 31, 2007 consolidated financial statements, our partners equity contributions with respect to certain transactions are classified as debt under the caption "Debt to Joint Venture Partner" in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2007, our Debt to Joint Venture Partner was $38,081,000. For a six month period beginning 54 months after formation, we have the right to acquire our partners interest based upon the market value of the properties. If we do not exercise our option, our partner can elect to purchase our interest in the properties during a six month period commencing upon expiration of our six month option period. If our partner fails to exercise its option, the Acquisition Joint Venture will be liquidated and the proceeds will be distributed to the partners according to the joint venture agreement. We have not included our Debt to Joint Venture Partner as a contractual obligation in the table above, since we only have the right, rather than a contractual obligation, to acquire our partners interest. Approximately $189.1 million in debt owed by First Shurgard was originally scheduled to mature in May 2008. However, in February 2008, under the terms of the related credit agreement we have requested a one year extension of the loan until May 2009. Assuming we have met our loan covenants, which we believe we have met, the lender is required to grant our request. Notwithstanding our expectation of receiving the requested one year extension, if the extension is not granted, we and our joint venture partner are required to contribute our pro rata share of funds necessary to repay the debt. We believe that our joint venture partner has the intention and ability to contribute their potential 80% share towards repayment of this debt if it is necessary. Concurrent with the completion of the proposed transaction for a prospective investor to acquire a 51% ownership interest in Shurgard Europe, we will seek to obtain a waiver from the lenders of the Second Shurgard credit facility for the change in control acceleration clause contained in the credit facility. See Note 19 to our December 31, 2007 financial statements for further information regarding the proposed transaction involving Shurgard Europe. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS: At December 31, 2007 we had no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined under Regulation S K 303(a)(4) and the instructions thereto. 69 SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM: Our Board has authorized the repurchase from time to time of up to 25,000,000 of our common shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. During 2004, we repurchased 445,700 shares for approximately $20.3 million. During 2005, we repurchased 84,000 shares for approximately $5.0 million. During 2006 and 2007, we did not repurchase any shares. During 2008 (through February 28, 2008), we repurchased 1,520,196 shares for approximately $111.9 million. From the inception of the repurchase program through February 28, 2008, we have repurchased a total of 23,721,916 common shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $679.1 million. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK To limit our exposure to market risk, we principally finance our operations and growth with permanent equity capital consisting either of common shares or preferred shares. At December 31, 2007, our debt as a percentage of total shareholders equity (based on book values) was 12.2%. Our preferred shares are not redeemable at the option of the holders. Our Series V shares are currently redeemable. Except under certain conditions relating to the Companys qualification as a REIT, the preferred shares are not redeemable by the Company prior to the following dates: Series W October 6, 2008, Series X November 13, 2008, Series Y January 2, 2009, Series Z March 5, 2009, Series A March 31, 2009, Series B September 30, 2009, Series C September 13, 2009, Series D February 28, 2010, Series E April 27, 2010, Series F August 23, 2010, Series G December 12, 2010, Series H January 19, 2011, Series I May 3, 2011, Series K August 8, 2011, Series L October 20, 2011, Series M January 9, 2012 and Series N July 2, 2012. On or after the respective dates, each of the series of preferred shares will be redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at $25 per depositary share (or share in the case of the Series Y), plus accrued and unpaid dividends through the redemption date. Our market risk sensitive instruments include notes payable and borrowing on bank credit facilities, which totaled $1,031,847,000 and none, respectively, at December 31, 2007. We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from the floating rate debt arrangements we acquired in the merger with Shurgard. We have foreign currency exposures related to our investment in the construction, acquisition, and operation of storage centers in countries outside the U.S. to the extent such activities are financed with financial instruments or equity denominated in non functional currencies. The aggregate book value of such real estate and intangibles was approximately $1.7 billion at December 31, 2007. Since all foreign debt is denominated in the corresponding functional currency, our currency exposure is limited to our investment (both equity and intercompany debt) in those countries. Countries in which Shurgard had exposure to foreign currency fluctuations include Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom. The table below summarizes annual debt maturities and weighted average interest rates on our outstanding debt at the end of each year (based on relevant LIBOR of 4.60% and a EURIBOR of 4.29% at December 31, 2007 and the applicable forward curve for following years) and fair values required to evaluate our expected cash flows under debt agreements and our sensitivity to interest rate changes at December 31, 2007 (dollar amounts in thousands). 70 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Fair Value Fixed rate debt........ $ 27,021 $ 12,508 $ 14,608 $ 227,179 $55,195 $ 311,291 $ 647,802 $ 647,802 Average interest rate.. 6.73% 6.72% 6.71% 6.01% 5.80% 5.50% Variable rate debt (1). $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ Average interest rate..

(2) First Shurgard and Second Shurgard have senior credit agreements denominated in Euros to borrow, in aggregate, up to (euro)271.6 million ($399.8 million as of December 31, 2007). As of December 31, 2007, the available amount under those credit facilities was in aggregate (euro)12.5 million ($18.4 million). Approximately $189.1 million in debt owed by First Shurgard was originally scheduled to mature in May 2008. However, in February 2008, under the terms of the related credit agreement we have requested a one year extension of the loan until May 2009. Assuming we have met our loan covenants, which we believe we have met, the lender is required to grant our request. At December 31, 2007, through the Shurgard Merger, we were party to pay fixed, receive variable interest rate swaps. The notional amounts, the weighted average pay rates and the terms of these agreements are summarized as follows: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Notional amounts (in millions).................. $ 120.0 $ $ $ $ $ Weighted average interest rate. 3.73% Based on our outstanding variable rate EURIBOR debt and interest rate swaps at December 31, 2007, a hypothetical increase in the interest rates of 100 basis points would cause the value of our derivative financial instruments to increase by $3.0 million. Conversely, a hypothetical decrease in the interest rates of 100 basis points would cause the value of our derivative financial instruments to decrease by $3.0 million. On January 2, 2007, we prepaid the (euro)325 million collateralized notes ($429 million at December 31, 2006) at our European operations that were otherwise payable in 2011. We also terminated the related European currency and interest rate hedges. Accordingly, the remaining debt in Europe relates to the joint venture properties, in which we have a 20% equity interest, and which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes.
