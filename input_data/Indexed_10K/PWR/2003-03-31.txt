ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 6. Selected Financial Data and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included in Item 8. Introduction We derive our revenues from one reportable segment by providing specialized contracting services and offering comprehensive network solutions. Our customers include electric power, gas, telecommunications and cable television companies, as well as commercial, industrial and governmental entities. We had consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 of $1.8 billion, of which 53% was attributable to electric power and gas customers, 16% to telecommunications customers, 12% to cable television operators and 19% to ancillary services, such as inside electrical wiring, intelligent traffic networks, cable and control systems for light rail lines, airports and highways, and specialty rock trenching, directional boring and road milling for industrial and commercial customers. We enter into contracts principally on the basis of competitive unit price or fixed price bids, the final terms and prices of which we frequently negotiate with the customer. Although the terms of our contracts vary considerably, most are made on either a unit price or fixed price basis in which we agree to do the work for a price per unit of work performed (unit price) or for a fixed amount for the entire project (fixed price). We also perform services on a cost plus or time and materials basis. We complete most installation projects within one year, while we frequently provide maintenance and repair work under open ended, unit price or cost plus master service agreements that are renewable annually. We generally recognize revenue when services are performed except when work is being performed under fixed price contracts. We typically record revenues from fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis, using the cost to cost method based on the percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion to total estimated costs to complete the contract. Some of our customers require us to post performance and payment bonds upon execution of the contract, depending upon the nature of the work to be performed. Our fixed price contracts often include payment provisions pursuant to which the customer withholds a 5% to 10% retainage from each progress payment and remits the retainage to us upon completion and approval of the work. Cost of services consists primarily of salaries, wages and benefits to employees, depreciation, fuel and other vehicle expenses, equipment rentals, subcontracted services, insurance, facilities expenses, materials and parts and supplies. Our gross margin, which is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenues, is typically higher on projects where labor, rather than materials, constitutes a greater portion of the cost of services. We can predict materials costs more accurately than labor costs. Therefore, to compensate for the potential variability of labor costs, we seek higher margins on labor intensive projects. We have a deductible of $1,000,000 per occurrence related to workers compensation, employers liability, automobile and general liability claims. On March 1, 2003, we increased the deductible for workers compensation insurance to $2,000,000 per occurrence. Effective January 1, 2002, we consolidated the various non union employee related health care benefits plans that existed at certain of our subsidiaries into one corporate plan that is subject to a deductible of $250,000 per claimant per year. Fluctuations in insurance accruals related to these deductibles could have an impact on operating margins in the period in which such adjustments are made. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits to management, administrative salaries and benefits, marketing, office rent and utilities, communications, professional fees and bad debt expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses can be impacted by our customers inability to pay for services performed. Seasonality; Fluctuations of Quarterly Results Our results of operations can be subject to seasonal variations. During the winter months, demand for new projects and new maintenance service arrangements may be lower due to reduced construction activity. However, demand for repair and maintenance services attributable to damage caused by inclement weather during the winter months may partially offset the loss of revenues from lower demand for new projects and new maintenance service arrangements. Additionally, our industry can be highly cyclical. As a result, our 18 volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in new projects in various geographic regions in the U.S. Typically, we experience lower gross and operating margins during the winter months due to lower demand for our services and more difficult operating conditions. The financial condition of our customers and their access to capital, variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular quarter, the timing and magnitude of acquisition assimilation costs, regional economic conditions and timing of acquisitions may also materially affect quarterly results. Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other quarter or for the entire year. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2002, we had cash and cash equivalents of $27.9 million, working capital of $317.4 million and long term debt of $213.2 million, net of current maturities. Our long term debt balance at that date included borrowings of $210.0 million of senior secured notes, and $3.2 million of other debt. We had $172.5 million of convertible subordinated notes as of December 31, 2002. In addition, we had $71.1 million of letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility. During the year ended December 31, 2002, operating activities provided net cash to us of $121.5 million. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital and other operating accounts totaled $93.1 million. Net changes in working capital and other operating accounts generated $28.4 million of cash flow from operations, in 2002, primarily as a result of managements focus on working capital and a general business slowdown. Cash flow from operations is primarily influenced by demand for our services, operating margins and the type of services we provide. We used net cash in investing activities of $70.1 million, including $49.5 million used for capital expenditures, $8.0 million used for the purchase of two businesses, net of cash acquired, and $17.3 million in additional non current notes receivable issued during 2002. We used net cash in financing activities of $29.8 million, resulting primarily from $109.3 million in net repayments of our credit facility, $10.8 million in payments of other long term debt obligations and $11.7 million used for the purchase of treasury stock, partially offset by $102.1 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock before transaction costs. On August 12, 2002 and December 20, 2002, we amended our credit facility. As a result of both amendments, the commitment of the banks under the credit facility was reduced from $350.0 million to $250.0 million. The commitment will remain in effect at $250.0 million through March 31, 2003, then reduce to $225.0 million and remain in effect at such amount through December 31, 2003. Effective January 1, 2004, the credit facility will reduce to $200.0 million and remain in effect at such amount through maturity of the credit facility on June 14, 2004. Further, the amendment restricts our ability to borrow an additional $25.0 million under the credit facility until we achieve, for two consecutive fiscal quarters beginning with the fourth quarter of 2002, certain minimum EBITDA (as defined in the credit facility) requirements. Amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to either (a) LIBOR plus 1.50% to 3.50%, as determined by the ratio of our total funded debt to EBITDA or (b) the banks prime rate plus up to 2.00%, as determined by the ratio of our total funded debt to EBITDA. Commitment fees of 0.375% to 0.50%, based on our total funded debt to EBITDA, are due on any unused borrowing capacity under the credit facility. Our weighted average borrowing rate under the credit facility for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 4.88%. The amended credit facility is less restrictive with respect to certain financial ratios and indebtedness covenants, including the maximum funded debt to EBITDA ratio, minimum interest coverage ratios and non cash impairment charges under SFAS Nos. 142 and 144. However, the amended credit facility is more restrictive with respect to our maximum senior debt to EBITDA ratio, capital expenditures and asset sales, prohibits any stock repurchase programs, and prohibits acquisitions through May 15, 2003. Additionally, the amended credit facility prohibits the payment of dividends and requires a mandatory reduction in the banks commitment by a portion of the proceeds from asset sales in excess of $5.0 million annually or upon the issuance of additional debt in excess of $15.0 million. Our borrowing availability under the credit facility varies from quarter to quarter depending upon our degree of compliance with certain financial ratios. As of March 14, 2003, we had approximately $50 million in cash and cash equivalents, no borrowings under the credit facility and $77.0 million of letters of credit outstanding, which based upon our current senior debt to EBITDA ratio, results in a borrowing availability of $77.4 million under the credit facility. Our current borrowing rate is LIBOR plus 3.50%. 19 As of December 31, 2002, we had $210.0 million of senior secured notes that have maturities ranging from three to eight years with a weighted average interest rate of 9.91%. On August 12, 2002 and December 20, 2002, we amended the senior secured notes, and as amended, they have financial covenants and restrictions substantially identical to those under the credit facility. In addition, the senior secured notes carry a make whole provision customary for this type of debt instrument on prepayment of principal, including, any mandatory prepayments. Pursuant to an intercreditor agreement, the senior secured notes rank equally in right of repayment with indebtedness under our credit facility. In connection with amendments to both the credit facility and the senior secured notes in 2002, we incurred additional debt issuance costs of approximately $6.2 million. We have accounted for these costs in accordance with EITF 98 14 for the credit facility and EITF 96 19 for the senior secured notes. Accordingly, a majority of these costs were capitalized and will be amortized over the remaining term of the respective agreement, as amended. As a result of the amendments, in accordance with EITF 98 14, we expensed a portion of the unamortized debt issuance costs as interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2002. As of December 31, 2002, we had $172.5 million in convertible subordinated notes that bear interest at 4.0% per year and are convertible into shares of our common stock at a price of $54.53 per share, subject to adjustment as a result of certain events. The convertible subordinated notes require semi annual interest payments until the notes mature on July 1, 2007. We have the option to redeem some or all of the convertible subordinated notes beginning July 3, 2003 at specified redemption prices, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If certain fundamental changes occur, as described in the indenture under which we issued the convertible subordinated notes, holders of the convertible subordinated notes may require us to purchase all or part of their notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In the event of such circumstance, consent to repurchase the convertible subordinated notes would be required under our credit facility and senior secured notes. We have specifically provided for non cash goodwill impairment charges up to $850 million in our credit facility and senior secured notes resulting from the adoption of SFAS Nos. 142 and 144. Goodwill impairment charges do not violate any covenants in our convertible subordinated notes. On October 15, 2002, First Reserve committed, subject to certain conditions, to make an investment in us through two transactions. The first transaction occurred on October 15, 2002, with First Reserve purchasing from us approximately 8.7 million shares of our newly issued common stock at $3.00 per share, for a total purchase price of $26.0 million, before transaction costs. As part of this transaction and in exchange for consideration from us of approximately $2.7 million, we also obtained from Aquila certain waivers of anti dilution rights, preemptive rights and limitations of the number of directors on our board of directors. After amending certain provisions of our agreements with lenders and senior secured note holders, the second transaction occurred on December 20, 2002, with First Reserve purchasing from us approximately 2.4 million shares of newly issued Series E Preferred Stock at $30.00 per share, for an additional investment of approximately $72.9 million. At a special meeting of stockholders held on December 27, 2002, our stockholders approved the convertibility of such Series E Preferred Stock and the conversion of the shares into common stock. The shares of Series E Preferred Stock were converted into 24.3 million shares of common stock on December 31, 2002. As of December 31, 2001 and 2002, dividends of $2.1 million had been accrued on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. In connection with their investment in us, on October 15, 2002, First Reserve forgave approximately $780,000 in dividends that had accrued on 939,380 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock that First Reserve acquired from Aquila. On December 2, 2002, December 23, 2002, and January 9, 2003, 238,000 shares, 7,000 shares and 939,380 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, respectively, were converted into shares of common stock and on February 27, 2003, all remaining outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into shares of common stock. There are currently no outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Any dividends that had accrued on the respective shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock were reversed on the date of conversion. Therefore, as of February 27, 2003, there were no accrued dividends. 20 Through February 20, 2003, First Reserve had the right to require us to repurchase the shares of common stock issued as a result of the conversion of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock for cash if we had a change in control. As such, the investment has been reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as Redeemable Common Stock at December 31, 2002. On February 20, 2003, at the expiration of this right, the Redeemable Common Stock was reclassified to stockholders equity. We anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our credit facility will provide sufficient cash to enable us to meet our working capital needs, debt service requirements and planned capital expenditures for property and equipment for at least the next 12 months. However, further deterioration in the markets we serve, material changes in our customers revenues or cash flows or adverse weather conditions may negatively impact our revenues and cash flows. These factors, coupled with the lowered capacity and restrictive covenants of our credit facility, may negatively impact our ability to meet such needs. Other Commitments. As is common in our industry, we have entered into certain off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets. Our significant off balance sheet transactions include liabilities associated with non cancelable operating leases, letter of credit obligations and surety guarantees. We have not engaged in any off balance sheet financing arrangements through special purpose entities. We enter into non cancelable operating leases for many of our facility, vehicle and equipment needs. These leases allow us to conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for use of facilities, vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them. At the end of the lease, we have no further obligation to the lessor. We may decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term, in which case we are typically liable to the lessor for the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease. We have guaranteed a residual value on certain equipment operating leases. We guarantee the difference between this residual value and the fair market value of the underlying asset at the date of termination of the leases. At December 31, 2002, the maximum guaranteed residual value would have been approximately $123.4 million. We believe that no significant payments will be made as a result of the difference between the fair market value of the leased equipment and the guaranteed residual value. However, there can be no assurance that future significant payments will not be required. Some customers require us to post letters of credit to guarantee performance under our contracts and to ensure payment to our subcontractors and vendors under those contracts. Certain of our vendors also require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on behalf of us, such as to beneficiaries under our self funded insurance programs. Such letters of credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial institution. The letter of credit commits the issuer to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the holder demonstrates that we have failed to perform specified actions. If this were to occur, we would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit. Depending on the circumstances of such a reimbursement, we may also have to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. To date we have not had a claim made against a letter of credit that resulted in payments by the issuer of the letter of credit or by us and do not believe that it is likely that any claims will be made under a letter of credit in the foreseeable future. We had $71.1 million in letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility primarily to secure obligations under our casualty insurance program at December 31, 2002. While not actual borrowings, letters of credit do reflect potential liabilities under our credit facility and therefore are treated as a use of borrowing capacity under our credit facility. These are irrevocable stand by letters of credit with maturities expiring at various times throughout 2003 and 2004. Upon maturity, it is expected that the majority of these letters of credit will be renewed for subsequent one year periods. Based upon our senior debt to EBITDA ratio, the borrowing availability under our credit facility was $83.3 million as of December 31, 2002. Many customers, particularly in connection with new construction, require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety. These bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors. If we fail to perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors, the customer may demand that the 21 surety make payments or provide services under the bond. We must reimburse the surety for any expenses or outlays it incurs. To date, we have not had any significant reimbursements to our surety for bond related costs. We believe that it is unlikely that we will have to fund claims under our surety arrangements in the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2002, the total amount of outstanding performance bonds was approximately $461.0 million. Our future contractual obligations, including interest under capital leases, are as follows (in thousands): Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Long term debt obligations including capital leases $ 392,331 $ 6,663 $ 2,231 $ 103,696 $ 5,225 $ 214,016 $ 60,500 Operating lease obligations $ 44,873 $ 18,970 $ 10,466 $ 8,234 $ 3,739 $ 1,379 $ 2,085 Concentration of Credit Risk. We grant credit, generally without collateral, to our customers, which include electric power and gas companies, telecommunications and cable television system operators, governmental entities, general contractors, and builders, owners and managers of commercial and industrial properties located primarily in the United States. Consequently, we are subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors throughout the United States. However, we generally are entitled to payment for work performed and have certain lien rights on our services provided. Under certain circumstances such as foreclosures or negotiated settlements, we may take title to the underlying assets in lieu of cash in settlement of receivables. As previously discussed herein, our customers in the telecommunications business have experienced significant financial difficulties and in several instances have filed for bankruptcy. Our utility customers are also experiencing business challenges in the current business climate. These economic conditions expose us to increased risk related to collectibility of receivables for services we have performed. No customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable or revenues as of or for the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001 or 2002. In June 2002, one of our customers, Adelphia Communications Corporation, filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, as amended. We have filed liens on various properties to secure substantially all of our pre petition receivables. Our carrying value is based upon our understanding of the current status of the Adelphia bankruptcy proceeding and a number of assumptions, including assumptions about the validity, priority and enforceability of our security interests. We currently believe we will collect a substantial majority of the balances owed. Should any of the factors underlying our estimate change, the amount of our allowance could change significantly. We are uncertain as to whether such receivables will be collected within one year and therefore have included this amount in non current assets as accounts and notes receivable as of December 31, 2002. Also included in accounts and notes receivable are amounts due from another customer relating to the construction of independent power plants. We have agreed to long term payment terms for this customer. The notes receivable are partially secured and bear interest at 9.5% per year. During 2002, we provided allowances for a significant portion of these notes receivable due to a change in the economic viability of the plants securing them. The collectibility of these notes may ultimately depend on the value of the collateral securing these notes. As of December 31, 2002, the total balance due from both of these customers was $78.4 million, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $28.4 million. Stock Employee Compensation Trust (SECT). On March 13, 2002, our board of directors approved the creation of a SECT to fund certain of our future employee benefit obligations using our common stock. The SECT was established by selling 8.0 million shares of our common stock, including 986,000 shares we purchased during 2001 pursuant to our Stock Repurchase Plan, to the SECT in exchange for a promissory note plus an amount equal to the aggregate par value of the shares. As part of the settlement of the proxy contest with Aquila, on May 20, 2002, we terminated the SECT and repurchased the 7,911,069 shares of common stock remaining in the SECT by canceling the promissory note. The 7,911,069 shares were transferred into treasury stock on May 21, 2002, and were retired on June 28, 2002. Stock Repurchase Plan. Our board of directors authorized a Stock Repurchase Plan under which up to $75.0 million of our common stock could be repurchased. Under the Stock Repurchase Plan, we could conduct purchases through open market transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws. During 2001, we purchased 986,000 shares of common stock for approximately $15.3 million. On March 13, 2002, the 22 986,000 shares of common stock were sold to our SECT, and were no longer considered treasury stock. These shares were subsequently retired on June 28, 2002, after we terminated the SECT. During 2002, Quanta purchased 924,500 shares of its common stock for approximately $11.7 million under the Stock Repurchase Plan. As of July 1, 2002, the independent committee of our board of directors determined to cease the Stock Repurchase Plan. As a result of the credit facility and senior secured notes amendments, any further stock repurchases, other than those associated with Quantas stock incentive plans, are prohibited. Litigation. On November 28, 2001, Aquila filed an arbitration demand against us with challenging our amendment to our stockholder rights plan. As part of the settlement of Aquilas proxy contest with us, discussed below, this lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice on May 21, 2002. On November 28, 2001, Aquila also filed a complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery that challenged the adoption of our rights plan amendment. As part of the settlement of Aquilas proxy contest, this lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice on May 31, 2002. On December 21, 2001, a purported stockholder of Quanta filed a putative class action and derivative complaint alleging that the named directors breached their fiduciary duties by taking certain actions, including adoption of the rights plan amendment, in response to the announcement by Aquila that it intended to acquire control of Quanta through open market purchases of our shares. On October 31, 2002, the case was dismissed at the request of the plaintiffs. On March 21, 2002, Aquila filed a complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that the Special Committee of our board of directors breached its fiduciary duty in connection with the adoption of our SECT and new employment agreements entered into with certain of our employees. As part of the settlement of Aquilas proxy contest, this lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice on May 30, 2002. In addition, we are from time to time a party to various other lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions typically seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, we accrue reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We do not believe that any of these other proceedings, separately or in the aggregate would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. Proxy Solicitation. On February 8, 2002, Aquila announced its intention to conduct a proxy solicitation to replace members of our board of directors with a slate of its own nominees. On May 20, 2002, we and Aquila announced that we had reached an agreement for Aquila to terminate its proxy contest. Under the terms of the settlement, Aquila withdrew all pending litigation and arbitration against us. The companies also agreed to a standstill whereby Aquila agreed not to purchase shares of our common stock on the open market and not to wage another proxy fight for control of us and we agreed to terminate the SECT. We recorded approximately $1.1 million and $10.5 million in proxy costs for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2002, respectively, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Change of Control. We entered into new employment agreements with certain employees, as of March 13, 2002, which become effective upon a change of control (as defined in the new employment agreements) of Quanta. The new employment agreements supplemented existing employment agreements already in effect. The new employment agreements provide that, following a change of control, if we terminate the employees employment without cause (as defined in the new employment agreements), the employee terminates employment for good reason (as defined in the new employment agreements), or the employees employment terminates due to death or disability, we will pay certain amounts to the employee, which may vary with the level of the employees responsibility and the terms of the employees prior employment arrangements. In addition, in the case of certain senior executives, these payments would also be due if the employee terminates his or her employment within the 30 day window period commencing six months after the change in control. On June 1, 2002, Mr. Colson, our chief executive officer, relinquished his right to receive the payment described above upon a voluntary termination during such 30 day period. 23 Acquisitions. During 2002, we acquired two companies for an aggregate consideration of 251,079 shares of common stock and approximately $8.0 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The cash portion of such consideration was provided by proceeds from borrowings under the credit facility. In connection with the amendment of our credit facility and senior secured notes, we are limited to an aggregate dollar level of cash consideration that we can use to fund acquisitions. Related Party Transactions. In the normal course of business, we from time to time enter into transactions with related parties. These transactions typically take the form of network service work for Aquila or facility leases with prior owners. See additional discussion in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Inflation Due to relatively low levels of inflation experienced during the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, inflation did not have a significant effect on our results. Significant Balance Sheet Changes Total assets decreased approximately $678.1 million in 2002 compared to 2001. This decrease is primarily due to the following: Goodwill and other intangibles, net decreased $641.4 million primarily due to impairments of goodwill pursuant to SFAS No. 142, which requires goodwill to be tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each subsidiary with its carrying value. Accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts decreased $87.5 million primarily due to lower levels of revenues during 2002, collections on accounts that were outstanding at December 31, 2001 and an increase of $1.7 million in the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, approximately $32.9 million in balances have been reclassified to non current accounts and notes receivable due to uncertainty related to their collectibility within the next twelve months. Current deferred taxes increased $6.9 million primarily due to increases in the current and long term allowance for doubtful accounts, which are not currently deductible. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased $10.8 million primarily due to the recording of a federal net operating loss which we intend to file as a carryback claim with the Internal Revenue Service. We expect to file the claim in 2003. Property and equipment, net decreased $15.9 million due to depreciation of $60.2 million recorded during the period and the sale of equipment that was no longer being used by certain of our subsidiaries, offset by increases as a result of capital expenditures of $49.5 million. Long term accounts and notes receivable, net increased $21.4 million primarily due to the recording of an additional note receivable of $17.3 million from one of our customers. We have agreed to long term payment terms for this customer. The notes receivable are partially secured and bear interest at 9.5% per year. In addition, we reclassified approximately $32.9 million from accounts receivable due to uncertainty related to their collectibility within the next twelve months, as discussed above. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded allowances for these accounts and notes receivable of approximately $28.4 million. Other assets, net increased $5.5 million due primarily to an accounts receivable balance due from one of our customers being reclassified, as title to the work performed by us has been transferred to us in lieu of payment and an increase in debt issuance costs incurred in connection with amendments to certain debt agreements in 2002. 24 In 2002, total liabilities decreased approximately $155.9 million, redeemable common stock increased $72.9 million and stockholders equity decreased approximately $595.1 million. These changes were primarily due to the following: Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased $13.2 million primarily due to a $9.5 million decrease in trade accounts payable due to lower levels of revenue during 2002. Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts decreased $14.7 million. The timing of billings and the willingness of our customers to accept billings in excess of the work performed fluctuate from period to period. In addition, work performed under fixed price contracts generally allow us to bill larger amounts earlier in the project. We performed less work under fixed price contracts during the latter portion of 2002 versus 2001. Long term debt, net of current maturities decreased $114.6 million due to payments against our credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2002, there were no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility. Deferred income taxes and other non current liabilities decreased $11.9 million. Long term deferred income tax assets and liabilities are presented net in the accompanying balance sheet. The $11.9 million decrease was primarily the result of the recording of a deferred tax asset for the tax benefit related to the impairments of goodwill pursuant to SFAS No. 142, partially offset by increases in deferred tax liabilities due to increased differences between the book and tax basis for certain of our assets. This decrease was also partially offset by increases in the long term portion of self insurance reserves. Redeemable common stock increased $72.9 million. On December 20, 2002, First Reserve purchased from us approximately 2.4 million shares of newly issued Series E Preferred Stock at $30.00 per share, for an investment of approximately $72.9 million. At a special meeting of stockholders held on December 27, 2002, our stockholders approved the convertibility of such Series E Preferred Stock and the conversion of the shares into common stock. The shares of Series E Preferred Stock were converted into 24.3 million shares of common stock on December 31, 2002. Through February 20, 2003, First Reserve had the right to require us to repurchase the shares of common stock issued as a result of the conversion of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock for cash if we had a change in control. As such, the investment has been reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as Redeemable Common Stock at December 31, 2002. On February 20, 2003, at the expiration of this right, the Redeemable Common Stock was reclassified to stockholders equity. Stockholders equity decreased $595.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2002. This was primarily the result of a net loss attributable to common stock of $628.1 million associated with the impairments of goodwill recorded pursuant to SFAS No. 142 and the purchase of approximately $11.7 million of treasury stock under our Stock Repurchase Plan, partially offset by the initial investment by First Reserve of $26.0 million, before transaction costs, the issuance of approximately $6.9 million in shares of common stock pursuant to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the acquisition of two companies which resulted in increased additional paid in capital of $3.4 million. 25 Results of Operations The following table sets forth selected statements of operations data and such data as a percentage of revenues for the years indicated (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2000 2001 2002 Revenues $ 1,793,301 100.0 % $ 2,014,877 100.0 % $ 1,750,713 100.0 % Cost of services (including depreciation) 1,379,204 76.9 1,601,039 79.5 1,513,940 86.5 Gross profit 414,097 23.1 413,838 20.5 236,773 13.5 Selling, general and administrative expenses 143,564 8.0 194,575 9.6 225,725 12.9 Special charges 28,566 1.6 Goodwill impairment 166,580 9.5 Goodwill amortization 19,805 1.1 25,998 1.3 Income (loss) from operations 222,162 12.4 193,265 9.6 (155,532 ) (8.9 ) Interest expense (25,708 ) (1.4 ) (36,072 ) (1.8 ) (35,866 ) (2.0 ) Other income (expense), net 2,597 0.1 (227 ) (2,446 ) (0.1 ) Income (loss) before income tax provision (benefit) and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 199,051 11.1 156,966 7.8 (193,844 ) (11.0 ) Provision (benefit) for income taxes 93,328 5.2 71,200 3.5 (19,710 ) (1.1 ) Income (loss) before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 105,723 5.9 85,766 4.3 (174,134 ) (9.9 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of tax 445,422 25.4 Net income (loss) 105,723 5.9 85,766 4.3 (619,556 ) (35.3 ) Dividends on preferred stock, net of forfeitures 930 0.1 930 0.1 (11 ) Non cash beneficial conversion charge 8,508 0.5 Net income (loss) attributable to common stock $ 104,793 5.8 % $ 84,836 4.2 % $ (628,053 ) (35.8 )% Year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the year ended December 31, 2001 Revenues. Revenues decreased $264.2 million, or 13.1%, to $1.75 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was attributable to lower revenues, primarily from telecommunications and cable customers, due in part to the continued decrease in capital spending by our customers, the inability of certain of these customers to raise new capital, bankruptcies of certain customers and the overall downturn in the national economy, which have negatively impacted the award of work to specialty contractors. This decrease was partially offset by a full year of contributed revenues for those companies acquired during 2001 and growth in revenues from our electric power and gas customers. Gross profit. Gross profit decreased $177.1 million to $236.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Gross margin decreased from 20.5% for the year ended December 31, 2001 to 13.5% for the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease in gross margin resulted primarily from declining volumes due to economic factors noted above, significantly lower margins on work performed due to increased pricing pressures and lower asset utilization. The decrease also resulted from higher than normal transition costs during the first six months of 2002 on one telecommunications outsourcing contract. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $31.2 million, or 16.0%, to $225.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded $35.7 million in bad debt expense, $10.5 million in proxy costs and $4.5 million in expensed loan and equity transaction costs associated with amendments of our existing debt agreements and issuances of stock. During the year ended December 31, 2001, we recorded $20.3 million in 26 bad debt expense and $1.1 million in proxy costs. Excluding the impact of these items, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased approximately $1.8 million, primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of costs associated with companies acquired during 2001 and higher professional fees due to increased collection efforts on troubled accounts, partially offset by reductions in personnel and bonuses. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to the items noted above, as well as the impact of lower revenues. Goodwill impairment. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recognized an interim non cash SFAS No. 142 goodwill impairment charge of $166.6 million. Any interim impairment adjustments recognized after adoption are required to be recognized as operating expenses. The primary factor contributing to the interim impairment charge was the overall deterioration of the business climate during 2002 in the markets we serve. Interest expense. Interest expense decreased $0.2 million, or 0.6%, to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, due to lower average levels of debt outstanding during 2002, partially offset by higher weighted average interest rates in 2002 and expensed loan costs associated with debt amendments in 2002. Provision (benefit) for income taxes. The benefit for income taxes was $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, with an effective tax rate of 10.2%, compared to a provision of $71.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 and an effective tax rate of 45.4%. The lower tax rate in 2002 results primarily from the interim goodwill impairment charge, the majority of which is not deductible for tax purposes, thereby reducing the amount of tax benefit recorded. Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of tax. Based on our transitional impairment test performed upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, we recognized a charge, net of tax, of $445.4 million to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill of our reporting units to its implied fair value for the year ended December 31, 2002. Under SFAS No. 142, the impairment adjustment recognized at adoption of the new rule was reflected as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the year ended December 31, 2002. Net income (loss). Net income decreased $705.3 million to a net loss of $619.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to net income of $85.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, primarily due to impairments of goodwill recorded pursuant to SFAS No. 142 and decreased gross profit as described above. Dividends on preferred stock. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded approximately $11,000 in negative dividends on preferred stock. In connection with their investment in us, on October 15, 2002, First Reserve acquired approximately 0.9 million shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. On October 15, 2002, First Reserve forgave approximately $780,000 in dividends that had accrued on those shares. On December 2, 2002, and December 23, 2002, 238,000 shares and 7,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, respectively, were converted into shares of common stock. Any dividends that had accrued on the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock were reversed on the date of conversion. Non cash beneficial conversion charge. The original as converted share price negotiated with First Reserve for the Series E Preferred Stock on October 15, 2002 was $3.00 per share which was an above market price. On December 20, 2002, the date First Reserve purchased the Series E Preferred Stock, our stock closed at $3.35 per share. Accordingly, we recorded a non cash beneficial conversion charge of $8.5 million based on the $0.35 per share differential. The non cash beneficial conversion charge is recognized as a deemed dividend to the Series E Preferred Stockholder and is recorded as a decrease to net income attributable to common stock and an increase in additional paid in capital. The non cash beneficial conversion charge had no effect on our operating income, cash flows or stockholders equity at December 31, 2002. Year ended December 31, 2001 compared to the year ended December 31, 2000 Revenues. Revenues increased $221.6 million, or 12.4%, to $2.01 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase was attributable to strong growth in electric power and gas revenues as a result of increased outsourcing and deregulation, a full year of contributed revenues in 2001 for those companies acquired in 2000 and revenues of $42.3 million from platform companies acquired in 2001 that continued to 27 exist as separate reporting subsidiaries. The increase was partially offset by decreased revenues from telecommunications customers due in part to the continued inability of certain of the customers to raise new capital and the overall downturn in the national economy. Gross profit. Gross profit decreased $0.3 million to $413.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Gross margin decreased from 23.1% for the year ended December 31, 2000 to 20.5% for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in gross margin resulted from lower margins on work performed for telecommunications customers due to increased pricing pressures, lower asset utilization and the economic factors noted above, partially offset by higher margins received on work performed for the electric power and gas customers. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $51.0 million, or 35.5%, to $194.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001 include $13.1 million in increased bad debt expense and $1.1 million in proxy costs. In addition, $4.2 million of the increase was attributable to the platform companies we acquired subsequent to December 31, 2000. Selling, general and administrative expenses also included a full period of costs in 2001 associated with those companies acquired during 2000. The remainder of the increase was attributable to tuck in acquisitions and the continued establishment of infrastructure to facilitate our growth and to integrate our acquired businesses. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to the items noted above. Merger and special charges. In December 2000, we agreed to conclude our obligations under the management services agreement with Aquila in exchange for a one time payment to Aquila of approximately $28.6 million. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $10.4 million, or 40.3%, to $36.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, due to higher average levels of debt experienced during 2001. Provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes was $71.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, with an effective tax rate of 45.4% compared to $93.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 and an effective tax rate of 46.9%. In 2000, the provision reflected a portion of the merger and special charges for which no tax benefit had been provided. Net income. Net income decreased $20.0 million, or 18.9%, to $85.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $105.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. New Accounting Pronouncements In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. SFAS No. 144 supersedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, and the accounting and reporting provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 (APB Opinion No. 30). SFAS No. 144 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and establishes criteria for determining when a long lived asset is held for sale. We adopted SFAS No. 144 on January 1, 2002, with no material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections. SFAS No. 145 requires that gains and losses from extinguishment of debt be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in APB Opinion No. 30. Applying the provisions of APB Opinion No. 30 will distinguish transactions that are part of an entitys recurring operations from those that are unusual and infrequent and meet the criteria for classification as an extraordinary item. SFAS No. 145 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2003. Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 145, if we record any extraordinary items related to the extinguishment of debt, we will have to reclassify such items in our prior period statements of operations to conform to the presentation required by SFAS No. 145. Under SFAS No. 145, we will report gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, if any, in pre tax earnings rather than in extraordinary items. 28 In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities, such as restructurings, involuntarily terminating employees and consolidating facilities initiated after December 31, 2002. We will apply this statement to exit or disposal activities, if any, beginning in fiscal 2003. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, which clarifies the disclosures that are to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements regarding obligations under certain guarantees issued. FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are effective for financial statements of interim or annual reports for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002, which we have adopted. We will adopt the initial recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 45 on a prospective basis. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both interim and annual financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. We have adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148 in these consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. Management has reviewed its development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. We believe the following accounting policies, which are also described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Current and Long Term Accounts and Notes Receivable and Provision for Doubtful Accounts. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts when collection of an account or note receivable is considered doubtful. Inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and estimates including, among others, our customers access to capital, our customers willingness or ability to pay, general economic conditions and the ongoing relationship with the customer. For example, certain of our customers, primarily large public telecommunications carriers, have filed for bankruptcy in the year ended December 31, 2002, or have been experiencing financial difficulties, and as a result we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect that certain customers may be unable to meet their obligations to us in the future. Should additional customers file for bankruptcy or experience difficulties, or should anticipated recoveries relating to the receivables in existing bankruptcies and other workout situations fail to materialize, we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of current reserves. 29 Goodwill and Other Intangibles. As stated in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, SFAS No. 142 provides that goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives not be amortized, but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment, and intangible assets that have finite useful lives should continue to be amortized over their useful lives. SFAS No. 142 also provides specific guidance for testing goodwill and other nonamortized intangible assets for impairment. Goodwill of a reporting unit shall be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Examples of such events or circumstances may include a significant change in business climate or a loss of key personnel, among others. SFAS No. 142 requires that management make certain estimates and assumptions in order to allocate goodwill to reporting units and to determine the fair value of reporting unit net assets and liabilities, including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, cost of capital and growth rates, which could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets, as compared to our accounting policy for the assessment of goodwill impairment in 2001, which was based on an undiscounted cash flow model. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized. Revenue Recognition. We typically record revenues from fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis, using the cost to cost method based on the percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion to total estimated costs to complete the contract. Changes in job performance, job conditions and final contract settlements, among others, are factors that influence the assessment of the total estimated costs to complete these contracts. Self Insurance. We are insured for workers compensation, employers liability, auto liability and general liability claims, subject to a deductible of $1,000,000 per occurrence. On March 1, 2003, we increased the deductible for workers compensation insurance to $2,000,000 per occurrence. Effective January 1, 2002, we consolidated the various non union employee related health care benefits plans that existed at certain of our subsidiaries into one corporate plan that is subject to a deductible of $250,000 per claimant per year. Losses up to the deductible amounts are accrued based upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. However, insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends and management believes such accruals to be adequate. Stock Options. We account for our stock based compensation under APB Opinion No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Under this accounting method, no compensation expense is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations if no intrinsic value of the option exists at the date of grant. In October 1995, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. SFAS No. 123 encourages companies to account for stock based compensation awards based on the fair value of the awards at the date they are granted. The resulting compensation cost would be shown as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Companies can choose not to apply the new accounting method and continue to apply current accounting requirements; however, disclosure is required as to what net income and earnings per share would have been had the new accounting method been followed. Outlook The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially. Like many companies that provide installation and maintenance services to the electric power, gas, telecommunications and cable television industries, we are facing a number of challenges. Our operating environment has changed dramatically. The telecommunications and utility markets have experienced substantial change during 2002 as evidenced by an increased number of bankruptcies in the telecommunica 30 tions market, continued devaluation of many of our customers debt and equity securities and pricing pressures resulting from challenges faced by major industry participants. These factors have contributed to the delay and cancellation of projects and reduction of capital spending that have impacted our operations and ability to grow at historical levels. We continue to focus on the elements of the business we can control, including cost control, the margins we accept on projects, collecting receivables, ensuring quality service and right sizing initiatives to match the markets we serve. These initiatives include aligning our work force with our current revenue base, evaluating opportunities to reduce the number of field offices and evaluating our non core assets for potential sale. Such initiatives could result in future charges related to, among others, severance, facilities shutdown and consolidation, property disposal and other exit costs as we execute these initiatives. We expect consistent demand for our services from our electric power and gas customers throughout 2003 with continued weakness in demand for our services from our telecommunications and cable customers and relatively level demand for our ancillary services. Financial and economic pressures have led our customers to return to their core competencies and focus on cost reductions, resulting in an increased focus on outsourcing services. We believe that we are adequately positioned to provide these services because of our proven full service operating units with broad geographic reach, financial capability and technical expertise. Capital expenditures in 2003 are expected to be approximately $50.0 million. A majority of the expenditures will be for operating equipment. We expect expenditures for 2003 to be funded substantially through internal cash flows and, to the extent necessary, from borrowings under our credit facility. In March 2003, in conjunction with a stock option exchange program, we cancelled eligible options to purchase an aggregate of 6,769,483 shares of our common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the offer, Quanta granted restricted stock representing an aggregate of 3,022,112 shares of our common stock. This restricted stock issuance will require us to recognize a non cash compensation charge of approximately $3.0 million per year over the three year vesting period of the restricted stock. Uncertainty of Forward Looking Statements and Information This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes statements reflecting assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events that are intended as forward looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as anticipate, estimate, project, forecast, may, will, should, could, expect, believe and other words of similar meaning. In particular, these include, but are not limited to, statements relating to the following: Projected operating or financial results; Expectations regarding capital expenditures; The effects of competition in our markets; The duration and extent of the current economic downturn; Materially adverse changes in economic conditions in the markets served by us or by our customers; and Our ability to achieve cost savings. Any or all of our forward looking statements may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions and by known or unknown risks and uncertainties, including the following: The duration and extent of the current economic downturn; The cost of borrowing, availability of credit and other factors affecting our financing activities; Quarterly variations in our operating results due to seasonality and adverse weather conditions; Material adverse changes in economic conditions in the markets served by us or by our customers; 31 The adverse impact of goodwill impairments; Replacement of our contracts as they are completed or expire; Rapid technological and structural changes that could reduce the demand for the services we provide; Our ability to effectively compete for market share; Our ability to generate internal growth; Our growth outpacing our infrastructure; Retention of key personnel and qualified employees; The impact of our unionized workforce on our operations and acquisition strategy; Potential exposure to environmental liabilities; Our ability to integrate companies we acquire; Beliefs and assumptions about the collectibility of receivables; Our dependence on fixed price contracts; and Beliefs or assumptions about the outlook for markets we serve. Many of these factors will be important in determining our actual future results. Consequently, no forward looking statement can be guaranteed. Our actual future results may vary materially from those expressed or implied in any forward looking statements. All of our forward looking statements, whether written or oral, are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements and any other cautionary statements that may accompany such forward looking statements. In addition, we disclaim any obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report. 32 ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk primarily related to potential adverse changes in interest rates and, to a certain extent, commodity prices, as discussed below. Management does not generally use derivative financial instruments for trading or to speculate on changes in interest rates or commodity prices. As of December 31, 2002, however, we had a derivative contract outstanding that related to anticipated exposure in the price of natural gas. We monitor our derivative position by regularly evaluating our position. Management is actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and continues to develop and utilize appropriate risk management techniques. We are not exposed to any other significant market risks, foreign currency exchange risk or interest rate risk from the use of derivative financial instruments. The sensitivity analyses below, which illustrate our hypothetical potential market risk exposure, estimate the effects of hypothetical sudden and sustained changes in the applicable market conditions on 2002 earnings. The sensitivity analyses presented do not consider any additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes. The hypothetical changes and assumptions may be different from what actually occurs in the future. Interest Rates. As of December 31, 2002, we had no derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. As such, we are exposed to earnings and fair value risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to our long term obligations. As of December 31, 2001 and 2002, the fair value of our fixed rate debt of $399.0 million and $392.3 million was approximately $357.1 million and $317.3 million, respectively, based upon discounted future cash flows using incremental borrowing rates and current market prices. As of December 31, 2001, the fair value of our variable rate debt of $109.3 million approximated book value and the detrimental effect on our pretax earnings of a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in fixed interest rates would be approximately $0.5 million. As of December 31, 2002, we had no borrowings under our credit facility and no other variable rate obligations. Commodity Price Exposure. In October 2001, we entered into a forward purchase contract (Contract A) with settlements through 2006, in order to secure pricing on anticipated gas requirements related to a project in process at December 31, 2001 that was substantially complete at March 31, 2002. Our objective was to mitigate the variability in the price of natural gas by securing the price we will have to pay to the Contract A counterparty. On March 29, 2002, we entered into a sub services agreement with one of our customers (the Counterparty Contract) whereby the customer assumed all obligations associated with Contract A. On November 5, 2002, Contract A was sold for a gain of $0.3 million and the related Counterparty Contract was terminated. In April 2002, we entered into another forward purchase contract (Contract B) with settlements through March 2003, in order to secure pricing on anticipated gas requirements related to a project completed during the quarter ended September 30, 2002. Our objective was to mitigate the variability in the price of natural gas by securing the price we will have to pay the Contract B counterparty. As of December 31, 2002, the fair value of Contract B was approximately $257,000. 33
