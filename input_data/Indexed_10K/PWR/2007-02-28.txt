Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 hereof, a significant portion of our revenues is recognized on a percentage of completion method of accounting, using the cost to cost method. This method is used because management considers expended costs to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts. This accounting method is standard for fixed price contracts. The percentage of completion accounting practice we use results in our recognizing contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs. The earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues, costs and profitability. Contract losses are recognized in full when determined, and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract profitability. Further, a substantial portion of our contracts contain various cost and performance incentives. Penalties are recorded when known or finalized, which generally is during the latter stages of the contract. In addition, we record cost recovery claims when we believe recovery is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. Actual collection of claims could differ from estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings. In certain circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments could be significant. Our dependence upon fixed price contracts could adversely affect our business. We currently generate, and expect to continue to generate, a portion of our revenues under fixed price contracts. We must estimate the costs of completing a particular project to bid for fixed price contracts. The actual cost of labor and materials, however, may vary from the costs we originally estimated. These variations, along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price contracts, may cause actual revenue and gross profits for a project to differ from those we originally estimated and could result in reduced profitability or losses on projects. Depending upon the size of a particular project, variations from the estimated contract costs could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal quarter or year. We are self insured against potential liabilities. Although we maintain insurance policies with respect to automobile, general liability, workers compensation and employers liability, those policies are subject to deductibles of $1.0 million to $2.0 million per occurrence, and we are primarily self insured for all claims that do not exceed the amount of the applicable deductible. In addition, beginning August 1, 2006, we have been subject to an additional cumulative aggregate liability of up to $2.0 million on workers compensation claims in excess of $2.0 million per occurrence per policy year. We also have an employee health care benefit plan for employees not subject to collective bargaining agreements, which is subject to a deductible of $250,000 per claimant per year. Losses up to the deductible amounts are accrued based upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported, with assistance from a third party actuary. However, insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program. If we were to experience insurance claims or costs significantly above our estimates, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in a given period. Our casualty insurance carrier for prior periods is experiencing financial distress, which may require us to make payments for losses that otherwise would be insured. Our casualty insurance carrier for the policy periods from August 1, 2000 to February 28, 2003 is experiencing financial distress, but is currently paying valid claims. In the event that this insurers financial situation deteriorates, we may be required to pay certain obligations that 14 Table of Contents otherwise would have been paid by this insurer. We estimate that the total future claim amount that this insurer is currently obligated to pay on our behalf for the above mentioned policy periods is approximately $6.2 million; however, our estimate of the potential range of these future claim amounts is between $3.6 million and $8.5 million. The actual amounts ultimately paid by us related to these claims, if any, may vary materially from the above range and could be impacted by further claims development and the extent to which the insurer can not honor its obligations. In any event, we do not expect any failure by this insurer to honor its obligations to us to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition; however, the impact could be material to our results of operations or cash flow in a given period. We may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial impact relating to occupational health and safety matters. Our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace. While we have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial resources in our occupational health and safety programs, our industry involves a high degree of operational risk and there can be no assurance that we will avoid significant liability exposure. Although we have taken what we believe are appropriate precautions, we have suffered fatalities in the past and may suffer additional fatalities in the future. Claims for damages to persons, including claims for bodily injury or loss of life, could result in substantial costs and liabilities. In addition, if our safety record were to substantially deteriorate over time, our customers could cancel our contracts and not award us future business. Our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of goodwill impairments. When we acquire a business, we record an asset called goodwill equal to the excess amount we pay for the business, including liabilities assumed, over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets of the business we acquire. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 provides that goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives not be amortized, but instead be tested at least annually for impairment, and intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives. SFAS No. 142 provides specific guidance for testing goodwill and other non amortized intangible assets for impairment. SFAS No. 142 requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions when allocating goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of reporting unit net assets and liabilities, including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, cost of capital and growth rates, which could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets. Fair value is determined using a combination of the discounted cash flow, market multiple and market capitalization valuation approaches. Absent any impairment indicators, we perform our impairment tests annually during the fourth quarter. As part of our 2006 annual test for goodwill impairment, goodwill in the amount of $56.8 million was written off as a non cash operating expense associated with a decrease in the expected future demand for the services of one of our businesses, which has historically served the cable television industry. Any future impairments would negatively impact our results of operations for the period in which the impairment is recognized. We may be unsuccessful at integrating companies that either we have acquired or that we may acquire in the future. We cannot be sure that we will successfully integrate our acquired companies with our existing operations without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial problems. If we do not implement proper overall business controls, our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent operating and financial practices at the companies we acquire and our overall profitability could be adversely affected. Integrating our acquired companies involves a number of special risks which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including: failure of acquired companies to achieve the results we expect; diversion of our managements attention from operational and other matters; difficulties integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies; inability to retain key personnel of acquired companies; risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities; and potential disruptions of our business. 15 Table of Contents If one of our acquired companies suffers customer dissatisfaction or performance problems, the reputation of our entire company could suffer. We extend credit to customers for purchases of our services, and in the past we have had, and in the future we may have, difficulty collecting receivables from major customers that have filed bankruptcy or are otherwise experiencing financial difficulties. We grant credit, generally without collateral, to our customers, which include electric power and gas companies, telecommunications and cable television system operators, governmental entities, general contractors, and builders, owners and managers of commercial and industrial properties located primarily in the United States. Consequently, we are subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors throughout the United States. In the past, our customers in the telecommunications business have experienced significant financial difficulties and in several instances have filed for bankruptcy. A number of our utility customers are also experiencing business challenges in the current business climate. If additional major customers file for bankruptcy or continue to experience financial difficulties, or if anticipated recoveries relating to receivables in existing bankruptcies or other workout situations fail to materialize, we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of current allowances provided. In addition, material changes in any of our customers revenues or cash flows could affect our ability to collect amounts due from them. The industries we serve are subject to rapid technological and structural changes that could reduce the demand for the services we provide. The electric power, gas, telecommunications and cable television industries are undergoing rapid change as a result of technological advances that could, in certain cases, reduce the demand for our services or otherwise negatively impact our business. New or developing technologies could displace the wireline systems used for voice, video and data transmissions, and improvements in existing technology may allow telecommunications and cable television companies to significantly improve their networks without physically upgrading them. A portion of our business depends on our ability to provide surety bonds. We may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects if we are not able to obtain the necessary surety bonds. Surety market conditions currently are difficult as a result of significant losses incurred by many sureties in recent periods, both in the construction industry as well as in certain larger corporate bankruptcies. We have granted security interests in various of our assets to collateralize our obligations to the surety. Further, under standard terms in the surety market, sureties issue or continue bonds on a project by project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing or renewing any bonds. Current or future market conditions, as well as changes in our suretys assessment of our operating and financial risk, could cause our surety providers to decline to issue or renew, or substantially reduce the amount of, bonds for our work and could increase our bonding costs. These actions could be taken on short notice. If our surety providers were to limit or eliminate our access to bonding, our alternatives would include seeking bonding capacity from other sureties, finding more business that does not require bonds and posting other forms of collateral for project performance, such as letters of credit or cash. We may be unable to secure these alternatives in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. Accordingly, if we were to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity, we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects. Many of our contracts may be canceled on short notice, and we may be unsuccessful in replacing our contracts if they are canceled or as they are completed or expire. We could experience a decrease in our revenue, net income and liquidity if any of the following occur: our customers cancel a significant number of contracts; we fail to win a significant number of our existing contracts upon re bid; we complete a significant number of non recurring projects and cannot replace them with similar projects; or we fail to reduce operating and overhead expenses consistent with any decrease in our revenue. Many of our customers may cancel our contracts on short notice, typically 30 90 days, even if we are not in default under the contract. Certain of our customers assign work to us on a project by project basis under master service agreements. Under these agreements, our customers often have no obligation to assign a specific amount of work to us. Our operations could decline significantly if the anticipated volume of work is not assigned to us. Many 16 Table of Contents of our contracts, including our master service agreements, are opened to public bid at the expiration of their terms. There can be no assurance that we will be the successful bidder on our existing contracts that come up for re bid. The departure of key personnel could disrupt our business. We depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and on senior management of our operating units, including the businesses we acquire. Although we have entered into employment agreements with terms of one to three years with most of our executive officers and certain other key employees, we cannot be certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees, could negatively impact our ability to manage our business. We do not carry key person life insurance on any of our employees. Our unionized workforce could adversely affect our operations and our ability to complete future acquisitions. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 50% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Although the majority of these agreements prohibit strikes and work stoppages, we cannot be certain that strikes or work stoppages will not occur in the future. Strikes or work stoppages would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and could cause us to lose business and decrease our revenue. In addition, our ability to complete future acquisitions could be adversely affected because of our union status for a variety of reasons. For instance, our union agreements may be incompatible with the union agreements of a business we want to acquire and some businesses may not want to become affiliated with a union based company. Our business is labor intensive, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees. Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability will be limited by our ability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our requirements. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy. For instance, we may experience shortages of qualified journeyman linemen. In addition, we cannot be certain that our labor expenses will not increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of these skilled personnel. Labor shortages or increased labor costs could impair our ability to maintain our business or grow our revenues. Our business growth could outpace the capability of our corporate management infrastructure. We cannot be certain that our infrastructure will be adequate to support our operations as they expand. Future growth also could impose significant additional responsibilities on members of our senior management, including the need to recruit and integrate new senior level managers and executives. We cannot be certain that we will be able to recruit and retain such additional managers and executives. To the extent that we are unable to manage our growth effectively, or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified management, we may not be able to expand our operations or execute our business plan. Our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities. Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, including those dealing with the handling and disposal of waste products, PCBs, fuel storage and air quality. We perform work in many different types of underground environments. If the field location maps supplied to us are not accurate, or if objects are present in the soil that are not indicated on the field location maps, our underground work could strike objects in the soil, some of which may contain pollutants. In such cases, these objects may rupture, resulting in the discharge of pollutants. In such circumstances, we may be liable for fines and damages, and we may be unable to obtain reimbursement from the parties providing the incorrect information. In addition, we perform directional drilling operations below certain environmentally sensitive terrains and water bodies. Due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies, it is possible that such directional drilling may cause a surface fracture, resulting in the release of subsurface materials. These subsurface materials may contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law, potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines. We also own and lease several facilities at which we store our equipment. Some of these facilities contain fuel storage tanks which are above or below ground. If these tanks were to leak, we could be responsible for the cost of remediation as well as potential fines. In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new clean up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could harm our financial condition and results of operations. In certain instances, we have obtained indemnification or covenants from third parties (including predecessors or lessors) for such cleanup and other obligations and liabilities that we believe are 17 Table of Contents adequate to cover such obligations and liabilities. However, such third party indemnities or covenants may not cover all of our costs, and such unanticipated obligations or liabilities, or future obligations and liabilities, may have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial condition. Further, we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify or be indemnified for all potential environmental liabilities relating to any acquired business. Risks associated with operating in international markets could restrict our ability to expand globally and harm our business and prospects. While only a small percentage of our revenue is currently derived from international markets, we hope to continue to expand the volume of services that we provide internationally. We presently conduct our international sales efforts in Canada, Mexico and selected countries overseas, but expect that the number of countries that we operate in could expand significantly over the next few years. Economic conditions, including those resulting from wars, civil unrest, acts of terrorism and other conflicts may adversely affect the global economy, our customers and their ability to pay for our services. In addition, there are numerous risks inherent in conducting our business internationally, including, but not limited to, potential instability in international markets, changes in regulatory requirements, currency fluctuations in foreign countries, and complex U.S. and foreign laws and treaties, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. These risks could restrict our ability to provide services to international customers and could adversely affect our ability to operate our business profitably. Opportunities within the government arena could lead to increased governmental regulation applicable to us and unrecoverable start up costs. Most government contracts are awarded through a regulated competitive bidding process. As we pursue increased opportunities in the government arena, managements focus associated with the start up and bidding process may be diverted away from other opportunities. If we were to be successful in being awarded government contracts, a significant amount of costs could be required before any revenues were realized from these contracts. In addition, as a government contractor, we would be subject to a number of procurement rules and other public sector liabilities, any deemed violation of which could lead to fines or penalties or a loss of business. Government agencies routinely audit and investigate government contractors. Government agencies may review a contractors performance under its contracts, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. If government agencies determine through these audits or reviews that costs were improperly allocated to specific contracts, they will not reimburse the contractor for those costs or may require the contractor to refund previously reimbursed costs. If government agencies determine that we engaged in improper activity, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties. In addition, if the government were to even allege improper activity, we also could experience serious harm to our reputation. Many government contracts must be appropriated each year. If appropriations are not made in subsequent years we would not realize all of the potential revenues from any awarded contracts. We may not be successful in continuing to meet the requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 has introduced many requirements applicable to us regarding corporate governance and financial reporting, including the requirements for management to report on our internal controls over financial reporting and for our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to this report. During 2006, we continued actions to ensure our ability to comply with these requirements. As of December 31, 2006, our internal control over financial reporting was effective; however, there can be no assurance that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in future years. Failure to maintain effective internal controls could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock and our other publicly traded securities, the reduced ability to obtain financing, the loss of customers, penalties and additional expenditures to meet the requirements. We may not have access in the future to sufficient funding to finance desired growth. If we cannot secure additional financing in the future on acceptable terms, we may be unable to support our growth strategy. We cannot readily predict the ability of certain customers to pay for past services or the timing, size and success of our acquisition efforts. Using cash for acquisitions limits our financial flexibility and makes us more likely to seek additional capital through future debt or equity financings. Our existing debt agreements contain significant restrictions on our operational and financial flexibility, including our ability to incur additional debt or conduct equity financings, and if we seek more debt we may have to agree to additional covenants that limit our operational and financial flexibility. When we seek additional debt or equity financings, we cannot be certain that additional debt or equity will be available to us on terms acceptable to us or at all. 18 Table of Contents Our 4.5% convertible subordinated notes are presently convertible. As a result of our common stock satisfying the market price condition of the convertible subordinated notes during the fourth quarter of 2006, the notes are presently convertible at the option of each holder during the first quarter of 2007. We have the right to deliver shares of our common stock, cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock upon a conversion of the notes. The notes may be convertible during future fiscal quarters upon the satisfaction of the market price condition or other conditions in future periods. The number of shares issuable upon a conversion of the notes will be determined based on a conversion rate of approximately $11.14 per share. In the event that all notes were converted for common stock, we would issue an aggregate of 24.2 million shares of our common stock. The conversion of some or all of our 4.5% convertible subordinated notes into our common stock could cause substantial dilution to existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issued upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the possibility that the notes may be converted may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the notes could depress the price of our common stock. If we elect to satisfy the conversion obligation in cash, the amount of cash payable upon conversion of the notes will be determined by the product of (i) the number of shares issuable for the principal amount of the converted notes at a conversion rate of approximately $11.14 per share and (ii) the average closing price of our common stock during a 20 day trading period following the holders unretracted election to convert the notes. To the extent that the average closing price of our common stock during this period exceeds $11.14 per share, we will be required to pay cash in excess of the principal amount of the notes being converted, which would result in the recording of a loss on early extinguishment of debt. Certain provisions of our corporate governing documents could make an acquisition of our company more difficult. The following provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as currently in effect, as well as our stockholder rights plan and Delaware law, could discourage potential proposals to acquire us, delay or prevent a change in control of us or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock: our certificate of incorporation permits our Board of Directors to issue blank check preferred stock and to adopt amendments to our bylaws; our bylaws contain restrictions regarding the right of stockholders to nominate directors and to submit proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings; our certificate of incorporation and bylaws restrict the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to act by written consent; we are subject to provisions of Delaware law which prohibit us from engaging in any of a broad range of business transactions with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date such stockholder became classified as an interested stockholder; and we have adopted a stockholder rights plan that could cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of Directors or permitted by the stockholder rights plan. ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. ITEM 2. Properties Facilities We lease our corporate headquarters in Houston, Texas and maintain offices nationwide. This space is used for offices, equipment yards, warehouses, storage and vehicle shops. As of December 31, 2006, we own 16 of the facilities we occupy, all of which are encumbered by our credit facility, and we lease the remainder. We believe that our existing facilities are sufficient for our current needs. 19 Table of Contents Equipment We operate a nationwide fleet of owned and leased trucks and trailers, support vehicles and specialty construction equipment, such as backhoes, excavators, trenchers, generators, boring machines, cranes, wire pullers and tensioners, all of which are encumbered by our credit facility. As of December 31, 2006, the total size of the rolling stock fleet was approximately 19,130 units. Most of this fleet is serviced by our own mechanics who work at various maintenance sites and facilities. We believe that these vehicles generally are well maintained and adequate for our present operations. ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings We are from time to time a party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions typically seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract and or property damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, we record reserves when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We do not believe that any of these proceedings, separately or in the aggregate, would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders During the fourth quarter of the year covered by this report, no matters were submitted to a vote of our security holders, through the solicitation of proxies or otherwise. PART II ITEM 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol PWR. Our common stock trades with an attached right to purchase Series D Junior Participating Preferred Stock as more fully described under the heading Stockholder Rights Plan in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 hereof. The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices of our common stock per quarter, as reported by the NYSE, for the two most recent fiscal years. High Low Year Ended December 31, 2005 1st Quarter $ 8.40 $ 7.25 2nd Quarter 9.52 7.60 3rd Quarter 12.95 8.85 4th Quarter 14.54 11.02 Year Ended December 31, 2006 1st Quarter $ 16.09 $ 12.24 2nd Quarter 18.92 14.47 3rd Quarter 18.02 14.40 4th Quarter 20.05 16.32 On February 20, 2007, there were 580 holders of record of our common stock and 17 holders of record of our Limited Vote Common Stock. There is no established trading market for the Limited Vote Common Stock; however, the Limited Vote Common Stock converts into common stock immediately upon sale. 20 Table of Contents Stock Repurchases During the Fourth Quarter of 2006 The following table contains information about our purchases of equity securities during the three months ended December 31, 2006. ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES (d) Maximum (c) Total Number Number of Shares of Shares Purchased That May Yet be as Part of Publicly Purchased Under (a) Total Number of (b) Average Price Announced Plans or the Plans or Period Shares Purchased Paid per Share Programs Programs December 1, 2006 December 31, 2006 3,330 (i) $ 17.63 None None (i) Represents shares purchased from employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards pursuant to the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (as amended and restated March 13, 2003) (the 2001 Plan). Dividends We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth, development and expansion of our business. Accordingly, we currently do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the immediate future. The declaration, payment and amount of future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors. These factors include our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows from operations, current and anticipated capital requirements and expansion plans, the income tax laws then in effect and the requirements of Delaware law. In addition, as discussed in Debt Instruments Credit Facility in Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, our credit facility includes limitations on the payment of cash dividends without the consent of the lenders. 21 Table of Contents Performance Graph The following Performance Graph and related information shall not be deemed soliciting material or to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference into such filing. The following graph compares, for the period from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2006, the cumulative stockholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total return on the Standard & Poors 500 Index (the S&P 500 Index), the Russell 2000 Index, and a peer group index previously selected by our management that includes six public companies within our industry (the Peer Group). The comparison assumes that $100 was invested on December 31, 2001 in our common stock, the S&P 500 Index, the Russell 2000 Index and the Peer Group, and further assumes all dividends were reinvested. The stock price performance reflected on the following graph is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance. The Peer Group is composed of Dycom Industries, Inc., MasTec, Inc., Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V., Shaw Group, Inc., InfraSource Services, Inc. and Pike Electric Corporation. The companies in the Peer Group were selected because they comprise a broad group of publicly held corporations, each of which has some operations similar to ours. When taken as a whole, the Peer Group more closely resembles our total business than any individual company in the group.

(b) Based on our transitional impairment test performed upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, we recognized a $488.5 million non cash charge ($445.4 million, net of tax) to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to the implied fair value of our reporting units. Basic and diluted earnings per share before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle were a loss of $2.90 per share. (c) The original as converted share price negotiated with First Reserve Fund IX, L.P.

Accordingly, we recorded a non cash beneficial conversion charge of $8.5 million based on the $0.35 per share differential. The non cash beneficial conversion charge was recognized as a deemed dividend to the Series E Preferred Stockholder and was recorded as a decrease in net income attributable to common stock and an increase in additional paid in capital. The non cash beneficial conversion charge had no effect on our operating income, cash flows or stockholders equity at December 31, 2002.

(f) As part of our 2006 annual goodwill test for impairment, goodwill of $56.8 million was written off as a non cash operating expense associated with a decrease in the expected future demand for the services of one of our businesses, which has historically served the cable television industry. (g) In the second quarter of 2006, we recorded a $1.6 million gain on early extinguishment of debt comprised of the gain from repurchasing a portion of our 4.0% notes, partially offset by costs associated with the related tender offer for such notes.

The following graph compares, for the period from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2006, the cumulative stockholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total return on the Standard & Poors 500 Index (the S&P 500 Index), the Russell 2000 Index, and a peer group index previously selected by our management that includes six public companies within our industry (the Peer Group). The comparison assumes that $100 was invested on December 31, 2001 in our common stock, the S&P 500 Index, the Russell 2000 Index and the Peer Group, and further assumes all dividends were reinvested. The stock price performance reflected on the following graph is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance. The Peer Group is composed of Dycom Industries, Inc., MasTec, Inc., Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V., Shaw Group, Inc., InfraSource Services, Inc. and Pike Electric Corporation. The companies in the Peer Group were selected because they comprise a broad group of publicly held corporations, each of which has some operations similar to ours. When taken as a whole, the Peer Group more closely resembles our total business than any individual company in the group.
