The companys primary products are oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide, helium, electronic gases and a wide range of specialty gases. Praxair Surface Technologies supplies high performance coatings that protect metal parts from wear, corrosion and high heat. Praxairs industrial gas operations are managed on a geographical basis and in 2008, 95% of sales were generated in four geographic segments (North America, Europe, South America, and Asia). The surface technologies segment generated the remaining 5% of sales. Praxair serves approximately 25 industries as diverse as healthcare and petroleum refining; computer chip manufacturing and beverage carbonation; fiber optics and steel making; and aerospace, chemicals and water treatment. The diversity of end markets creates financial stability for Praxair in varied business cycles. Praxair focuses its operational and growth strategies on the following 11 core geographies where the company has its strongest market positions and where distribution and production operations allow the company to deliver the highest level of service to its customers at the lowest cost. North America South America Europe Asia United States Brazil Spain China Canada Italy India Mexico Germany/Benelux Thailand Korea Praxair manufactures and distributes its products through a network of hundreds of production plants, pipeline complexes, distribution centers and delivery vehicles. Major pipeline complexes are located in the United States, Brazil, Spain and Germany. These networks are a competitive advantage, providing the foundation of reliable product supply to the companys customer base. The majority of Praxairs business is conducted through long term contracts which provide stability in cash flow and the ability to pass through changes in energy costs to customers. The company has significant growth opportunities in diverse markets including: hydrogen for refining; oxygen for healthcare; and nitrogen and carbon dioxide for oil and gas production. 17 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FINANCIAL RESULTS & OUTLOOK Praxair delivered strong financial results in 2008, reporting record sales and operating cash flow. Sales growth was driven primarily by new business, plant start ups and higher pricing. These results reflect strong sales growth in the first three quarters and a sequential decline in the fourth quarter due to sharply lower volumes in November and December and negative impact from currency translation. In response to rapidly declining demand and falling commodity prices resulting from the global economic and credit crisis, customers around the world curtailed production, particularly in the electronics, chemicals and metals end markets. Praxair moved quickly to reduce costs resulting in a charge to earnings in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter actions are expected to significantly offset the impact of volume declines in earnings in 2009. 2008 Year in review Sales up 15% to $10,796 million versus $9,402 million in 2007, reflecting growth from new business, new plant start ups and higher pricing. Acquisitions and currency also contributed favorably to sales growth. Results reflect strong sales growth in the first three quarters and a sequential decline in the fourth quarter due to sharply lower volumes in November and December and negative impact from currency translation resulting from the global economic crisis. In the fourth quarter 2008, Praxair recorded pre tax charges totaling $177 million ($114 million after tax and minority interests), relating to the cost reduction program and other charges. In addition, the 2008 first quarter included a pension settlement charge of $17 million ($11 million after tax). Operating profit of $1,883 million, a 5% increase over $1,786 million in 2007, including the impact of the charges above. Underlying operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing, volume growth and cost savings from productivity initiatives. Net income of $1,211 million and diluted earnings per share of $3.80, including the impact of the charges above. Cash flow from operations of $2,038 million, a 4% increase over $1,958 million in 2007. Capital expenditures of $1,611 million to support strong project backlog and core business acquisitions of $130 million. 2009 Outlook Praxairs outlook is cautious for 2009 as the company expects the global economy to remain weak. Sales in the range of $9.5 billion to $10 billion, or about 10% below 2008 sales. The negative impact of currency, lower natural gas prices and lower volumes will be partially offset by growth from new projects and new applications technologies. Diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.80 to $4.20. Effective tax rate of about 28%. Capital expenditures in the range of $1.4 to $1.5 billion. The above guidance should be read in conjunction with the section entitled Forward Looking Statements. Praxair provides quarterly updates on operating results, material trends that may affect financial performance, and financial earnings guidance via earnings releases and investor teleconferences. These materials are available on the companys website, www.praxair.com, but are not incorporated herein. 18 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED RESULTS AND OTHER INFORMATION The following table provides selected data for 2008, 2007, and 2006: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Variance 2008 vs.2007 2007 vs.2006 Sales $ 10,796 $ 9,402 $ 8,324 15 % 13 % Gross margin (a) $ 4,301 $ 3,845 $ 3,356 12 % 15 % As a percent of sales 39.8 % 40.9 % 40.3 % Selling, general and administrative $ 1,312 $ 1,190 $ 1,086 10 % 10 % As a percent of sales 12.2 % 12.7 % 13.0 % Depreciation and amortization $ 850 $ 774 $ 696 10 % 11 % Cost reduction program and other charges $ 177 $ $ Pension settlement charge $ 17 $ $ Other income (expenses) net $ 35 $ 3 $ 32 Operating profit $ 1,883 $ 1,786 $ 1,519 5 % 18 % Interest expense net $ 198 $ 173 $ 155 14 % 12 % Effective tax rate 27.6 % 26.0 % 26.0 % Net income $ 1,211 $ 1,177 $ 988 3 % 19 % Diluted earnings per share $ 3.80 $ 3.62 $ 3.00 5 % 21 % Diluted shares outstanding 318,302 324,842 329,293 (2 )% (1 )% Number of employees 26,936 27,992 27,042 (4 )% 4 % (a) Gross margin excludes depreciation and amortization expense. Special Charges in 2008 Cost Reduction Program and Other Charges Fourth Quarter 2008 In the fourth quarter 2008, Praxair recorded pre tax charges totaling $177 million ($114 million after tax and minority interests), including $118 million relating to severance and other exit costs associated with a previously announced global cost reduction program which was initiated in response to the continuing economic downturn. Other charges totaling $59 million reflect recent developments related primarily to social tax matters in Brazil. Amounts were determined based on formal plans approved by management using the best information available; any differences with actual amounts incurred will be adjusted when determined. Following is a summary of the charges by reportable segment. Corporate costs of $4 million have been allocated to segments based on sales. (Millions of Dollars) Cost Reduction Program SeveranceCosts Costs Associatedwith Exit orDisposalActivities Total CostReductionProgram OtherCharges Total North America $ 25 $ 39 $ 64 $ $ 64 Europe 14 2 16 16 South America 9 10 19 59 78 Asia 1 4 5 5 Surface technologies 6 8 14 14 $ 55 $ 63 $ 118 $ 59 $ 177 19 Table of Contents Severance costs of $55 million are for the termination of approximately 1,675 employees; 1,260 related to cost reduction initiatives spread across all segments, and 415 related to exit or disposal activities. At December 31, 2008, 1,090 of these positions have been eliminated, including about 74% of the cost reduction initiatives. The remaining actions are planned to be completed in 2009 primarily as businesses are sold or shut down. Non severance costs of $63 million associated with exit or disposal activities include asset write downs and other costs associated with non strategic activities, net of expected sale proceeds which are not significant. The other charges of $59 million reflect the impacts of recent developments related to ongoing social tax claims in Brazil. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of these charges, including cash flow requirements and a summary of the activity during 2008. Pre tax cost savings from the cost reduction program are estimated to be about $80 million in 2009 and $100 million annually thereafter. Pension Settlement Charge First Quarter 2008 In the first quarter 2008, Praxair recorded a pension settlement charge of $17 million ($11 million after tax) related to lump sum benefit payments made from the U.S. supplemental pension plan to a number of recently retired senior managers, including Praxairs former chairman and chief executive officer. 2008 Compared With 2007 % Changefrom Prior Year 2008 2007 Sales Volume 3 % 4 % Price 6 % 3 % Acquisitions/divestitures 2 % 2 % Currency 3 % 4 % Natural gas 1 % Total sales change 15 % 13 % Sales in 2008 increased $1,394 million, or 15%, versus 2007. Sales grew in all geographies driven by new business, plant start ups and continued strong pricing trends. Volume growth of 3% reflects strong sales to the manufacturing, energy and metals end markets, mitigated by shut downs in the third quarter due to Hurricanes Ike and Gustav and significantly lower volumes in November and December due to production cut backs and shut downs related to the global economic crisis. Higher pricing contributed 6% to sales growth, due to continued pricing actions and the pass through of higher power costs and surcharges. The favorable impact of currency, primarily in Brazil, Europe and Canada, increased sales by 3%. The net effect of acquisitions and divestitures contributed 2% to sales. The contractual pass through of higher natural gas costs to on site hydrogen customers increased sales by $136 million, or 1%, with a minimal impact on operating profit. Gross margin in 2008 increased $456 million, or 12%, versus 2007. The decrease in the gross margin percentage to 39.8% was due primarily to the contractual pass through of higher natural gas and power costs to customers. 20 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2008 were $1,312 million, or 12.2% of sales, versus $1,190 million, or 12.7% of sales, for 2007. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales was due to realized benefits from productivity initiatives and the increase in sales due to the pass through of higher natural gas costs to customers. Depreciation and amortization expense in 2008 increased $76 million, or 10%, versus 2007. The increase was principally due to new plant start ups. Other income (expenses) net in 2008 was a $35 million benefit versus a $3 million benefit in 2007. 2008 included currency related net gains of $23 million, which primarily consisted of net income hedge gains (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements). See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the major components of Other income (expense) net. Operating profit in 2008 increased $97 million, or 5%, versus 2007. Excluding the $177 million cost reduction program and other charges in the fourth quarter and the $17 million pension settlement charge in the first quarter, operating profit increased $291 million, or 16%. The underlying increase in operating profit was principally due to higher pricing, new business and the continued impact of productivity initiatives. Interest expense net in 2008 increased $25 million, or 14%, versus 2007 due to higher debt levels during 2008 partially offset by capitalized interest relating to higher capital expenditures and lower interest rates in the fourth quarter. The effective income tax rate for 2008 was 27.6% versus 26.0% in 2007. Excluding the impact of the cost reduction program and other charges and the pension settlement charge, the underlying effective tax rate for 2008 was 28.2%. This increase in 2008 was primarily due to earnings growth. At December 31, 2008, minority interests consisted principally of minority shareholders investments in Asia (primarily in China and India), Europe (primarily in Italy), and North America (primarily within Praxair Distribution). The increase in minority interests of $2 million in 2008 was primarily due to increased minority interest income in Italy partially offset by a $4 million impact in minority interests related to the cost reduction program and other charges in the fourth quarter. Praxairs significant equity investments are in Italy, Norway, the United States and China. The companys share of net income from equity investments increased $10 million in 2008 primarily related to the acquisition of a 50% interest in an industrial gas business in Norway in November of 2007 (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements) and higher earnings in its investments in Italy and China. Net income in 2008 increased $34 million, or 3%, versus 2007. Excluding the cost reduction program and other charges of $114 million after tax and the pension settlement charge of $11 million after tax, net income increased $159 million, or 14%. Operating profit growth was the primary driver of the net income growth partially offset by higher interest expense due to higher debt levels in 2008 and the increase in the effective tax rate. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased $0.18 per diluted share, or 5% versus 2007. In 2008, EPS included the cost reduction program and other charges and a pension settlement charge totaling $0.40 per diluted share. Excluding these special charges, EPS increased 16% in 2008. The underlying growth in EPS is in line with net income growth and the lower number of diluted shares outstanding due to the impact of the companys net repurchases of common stock in connection with two publicly announced stock repurchase programs (see Liquidity, Capital Resources and Other Financial Data section of Managements Discussion and Analysis). See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a calculation of diluted earnings per share. 21 Table of Contents The number of employees at December 31, 2008 was 26,936, a decrease of 1,056 employees from December 31, 2007, primarily due to the cost reduction program in the fourth quarter of 2008, partially offset by acquisitions made during the year. 2007 Compared With 2006 % Changefrom Prior Year 2007 2006 Sales Volume 4 % 4 % Price 3 % 4 % Acquisitions/divestitures 2 % Currency 4 % 2 % Natural gas (1 )% Total sales change 13 % 9 % Sales in 2007 increased $1,078 million, or 13%, versus 2006. Sales grew in all geographies, led by growth in Asia and South America from new business and project start ups, and continued volume growth in North America. Volume growth of 4% reflects strong volumes to the manufacturing, energy, and metals end markets. Higher pricing contributed 3% to sales growth. Currency appreciation, primarily in Europe and South America, increased sales by 4%. Acquisitions and divestitures contributed 2%. The pass through of natural gas costs to on site hydrogen customers was neutral for the year. Gross margin in 2007 improved $489 million, or 15%, versus 2006. The increases in the gross margin percentage to 40.9% was due primarily to higher pricing and cost efficiency and productivity programs which outpaced underlying inflationary cost pressures. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2007 were $1,190 million, or 12.7% of sales, versus $1,086 million, or 13.0% of sales, for 2006. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales was due to realized benefits from productivity initiatives. Depreciation and amortization expense in 2007 increased $78 million, or 11%, versus 2006. The increase was principally due to new plant start ups and currency effects. Other income (expenses) net in 2007 was a $3 million benefit versus a $32 million benefit in 2006. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the major components of Other income (expense) net. Operating profit in 2007 increased $267 million, or 18%, versus 2006. The increase was principally driven by new business, higher pricing, and the continued impact of focused productivity initiatives. Interest expense net in 2007 increased $18 million, or 12%, versus 2006 as a result of higher debt balances primarily used to finance acquisitions and common stock repurchases. The increase in interest incurred on outstanding debt was partially reduced by interest capitalized relating to higher capital expenditures. The effective income tax rate for 2007 and 2006 was 26%. At December 31, 2007, minority interests consisted principally of minority shareholders investments in Asia (primarily in China and India), Europe (primarily in Italy), and North America (primarily within Praxair Distribution). The increase in minority interests of $12 million in 2007 was primarily due to increased minority interest income in Italy and the formation of a new majority owned packaged gas distribution subsidiary with GT&S, Inc. (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). 22 Table of Contents Praxairs significant equity investments are in Italy, Norway, the United States and China. The companys share of net income from equity investments increased $16 million in 2007 primarily related to higher earnings in its investments in Italy and China. Income in 2007 increased $189 million, or 19%, versus 2006. Operating profit growth was the primary driver of the net income improvement. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased $0.62 per diluted share, or 21% versus 2006. The underlying growth in EPS is in line with net income growth and the lower number of diluted shares outstanding due to the impact of the companys net repurchases of common stock in connection with a publicly announced stock repurchase program. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a calculation of diluted earnings per share. The number of employees at December 31, 2007 was 27,992, an increase of 950 employees from December 31, 2006, primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2007. Related Party Transactions The companys related parties are primarily unconsolidated equity affiliates. The company did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated with independent parties. Environmental Matters Praxairs principal operations relate to the production and distribution of atmospheric and other industrial gases, which historically have not had a significant impact on the environment. However, worldwide costs relating to environmental protection may continue to grow due to increasingly stringent laws and regulations, and Praxairs ongoing commitment to rigorous internal standards. Climate Change There is increasing political attention being paid to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Internationally, the United Nations meeting in December 2009 in Copenhagen is widely expected to define a post Kyoto international regime to address climate change. In the United States, laws regulating GHG emissions have been enacted in California and New Jersey, among other states, and bills are being considered by still more states. Regional state initiatives have been implemented that will regulate greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel driven power plants and some federal legislative proposals also focus on such power plants. As a large user of electricity, Praxair is aware of potential cost implications that may arise from such regulatory controls. However, Praxairs customer contracts routinely provide rights to recover increased electricity costs incurred by Praxair. Hydrogen production plants have been identified under California law as a source of carbon dioxide emissions and these plants may become subject to proposed federal climate change legislation. Hydrogen is essential to refineries which use it to remove sulfur from transportation fuels in order to meet ambient air quality standards. It is possible that limits or offset requirements may be applied to such plants carbon dioxide emissions at some future time, but it is premature to judge the impact of prospective legislative or regulatory proposals or to try to quantify potential costs to the company. Regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may also provide Praxair with business opportunities. Praxair continues to develop new applications technologies that help its customers lower energy consumption and lower emissions in their own processes. 23 Table of Contents Costs Relating to the Protection of the Environment Environmental protection costs in 2008 included approximately $21 million in capital expenditures and $29 million of expenses. Environmental protection expenditures were approximately $12 million higher in 2008 versus 2007 primarily due to increases in capital projects and increased compliance costs. Praxair anticipates that future annual environmental protection expenditures will be similar to 2008, subject to any significant changes in existing laws and regulations. Based on historical results and current estimates, management does not believe that environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any given year. Legal Proceedings See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning legal proceedings. Retirement Benefits The non cash pension and OPEB funded status liability increased $341 million to $696 million at December 31, 2008 ($457 million after tax) from $355 million at December 31, 2007 ($235 million after tax). The increase was due primarily to the significant reduction in the fair value of the U.S. pension plans assets during 2008. Pension contributions were $20 million in 2008 and $22 million in 2007. Estimates of 2009 contributions are in the range $70 million to $100 million, all of which are required by funding regulations or laws. Praxair assumes an expected return on plan assets for 2009 in the U.S. of 8.25%. In 2009, consolidated pension expense is expected to be approximately $42 million versus $54 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. Consolidated pension expense in 2008 included a settlement charge of $17 million. See the Critical Accounting Policies section and Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of the companys retirement benefits. Insurance Praxair purchases insurance to limit a variety of risks, including those related to workers compensation, third party liability and property. Currently, the company self retains the first $5 million per occurrence for workers compensation, general and vehicle liability and retains $2.5 million to $5 million per occurrence at its various properties worldwide. To mitigate its aggregate loss potential above varying retentions, the company purchases insurance coverage from highly rated insurance companies at what it believes are reasonable coverage levels. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the company had recorded a total of $39 million and $43 million, respectively, representing an estimate of the retained liability for the ultimate cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet dates. The estimated liability is established using statistical analyses and is based upon historical experience, actuarial assumptions and professional judgment. These estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency and are subject to a significant degree of inherent variability. If actual claims differ from the companys estimates, they will be adjusted at that time and financial results could be impacted. Praxair recognizes estimated insurance proceeds relating to damages at the time of loss only to the extent of incurred losses. Any insurance recoveries for business interruption and for property damages in excess of the net book value of the property are recognized only when realized. 24 Table of Contents Currency The results of Praxairs non U.S. operations are translated to the companys reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, from the functional currencies used in the countries in which the company operates. For most foreign operations, Praxair uses the local currency as its functional currency. There is inherent variability and unpredictability in the relationship of these functional currencies to the U.S. dollar and such currency movements may materially impact Praxairs results of operations in any given period. To help understand the reported results, the following is a summary of the significant currencies underlying Praxairs consolidated results and the exchange rates used to translate the financial statements (rates of exchange expressed in units of local currency per U.S. dollar): Percent of2008ConsolidatedSales (a) Income Statement Balance Sheet Average Year Ended December 31, December 31, Currency 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 European euro 16 % 0.67 0.73 0.80 0.71 0.69 Brazilian real 15 % 1.80 1.94 2.17 2.34 1.77 Canadian dollar 8 % 1.04 1.08 1.14 1.22 0.98 Mexican peso 5 % 10.89 10.96 10.91 13.53 10.87 Chinese RMB 2 % 6.96 7.63 7.98 6.84 7.31 Indian rupee 2 % 42.80 41.48 45.38 48.50 39.44 Korean won 2 % 1,056 930 959 1,259 941 Argentinean peso 1 % 3.16 3.12 3.08 3.45 3.15 Colombian peso 1 % 1,947 2,078 2,358 2,243 2,015 Singaporean dollar 1 % 1.41 1.51 1.60 1.44 1.45 Taiwan dollar 1 % 31.45 32.85 32.57 33.01 32.54 Thailand bhat 1 % 32.54 32.46 38.18 35.00 30.10 Venezuelan bolivar (b) &lt;1 % 2.15 2,150 2,150 2.15 2,150 (a) Certain Surface technologies segment sales are included in European and Brazilian sales.

North America % Changefrom Prior Year 2008 2007 Sales Volume 1 % 3 % Price 6 % 3 % Acquisitions/divestitures 4 % 3 % Currency 1 % 1 % Natural gas 3 % Total North America sales change 15 % 10 % The North America segment includes Praxairs industrial gases operations in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Sales for 2008 increased $754 million, or 15%, versus 2007. Volume growth of 1% reflects higher sales to the energy and manufacturing markets which were mitigated by lower volumes in the third quarter due to Hurricanes Ike and Gustav and lower volumes in November and December, primarily in the metals, chemicals 26 Table of Contents and electronics end markets, due to production cut backs and shut downs related to the global economic crisis. Higher pricing contributed 6% to sales growth, due to continued strong pricing trends and the pass through of higher power costs and surcharges. Currency appreciation in Canada contributed 1% to sales. Acquisitions of U.S. and Canadian packaged gas distributors contributed 4% to sales. The contractual pass through of higher natural gas costs to on site hydrogen customers increased sales by $136 million, or 3%, for the year with minimal impact on operating profit. Operating profit for 2008 increased $131 million, or 14%, versus 2007. Strong pricing trends and cost savings from productivity and cost reduction programs were the primary drivers of operating profit growth. Weak volumes are expected to continue into the first quarter of 2009 as underlying demand is not expected to recover and large customer turnarounds are anticipated. In 2008, Praxair acquired Kirk Welding Supply, Inc., an independent packaged gas distributor with sales of $28 million in 2007 and operations in Kansas and Missouri as well as several smaller independent packaged gas distributors in the U.S. and Canada. Sales for 2007 increased $489 million, or 10%, versus 2006. Higher pricing increased sales by 3% due to pricing actions to recover higher costs. Volume growth was 3% due to higher on site, merchant liquid and packaged gases volumes primarily to the energy and general manufacturing end markets. Higher sales to the healthcare, electronics and food and beverage markets also contributed to volume growth. Currency appreciation in Canada contributed 1% to sales. Acquisitions contributed 3% to sales. The pass through of natural gas costs to on site hydrogen customers was neutral to sales for the year. Operating profit for 2007 increased $125 million, or 15%, versus 2006. Volume growth, realized price increases and the continued impact of cost reduction programs were the primary drivers of the strong operating profit growth. Europe % Changefrom Prior Year 2008 2007 Sales Volume 1 % 4 % Price 4 % 3 % Divestitures (2 )% Currency 9 % 9 % Total Europe sales change 12 % 16 % Praxairs European industrial gases business is primarily in Italy, Spain, Germany and the Benelux region. On April 1, 2008, Praxair completed the sale of its majority interest in Maxima Air Separation Center Ltd. with operations in Israel which did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements in 2008. Maxima contributed $27 million to sales in 2007. Sales for 2008 increased $157 million, or 12%, versus 2007. Favorable currency contributed 9% to sales growth. Volume growth of 1% was due to new business and new applications and higher sales to the chemicals, healthcare and food and beverage markets. Volume growth during the year was partially offset by lower volumes in the fourth quarter driven by cutbacks by steel and chemical customers in Germany and lower sales to the metals and general manufacturing end markets in Spain. Realized price increases of 4% included the pass through of higher energy, power and distribution costs. The divestiture of the industrial gas business in Israel decreased sales by 2% for the year. 27 Table of Contents Operating profit for 2008 increased $50 million, or 16%, versus 2007. Operating profit for 2008 included a $10 million gain related to net income hedges (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements). Excluding the impact of net income hedge gains, operating profit increased $40 million, or 13%. Operating profit growth was driven by increased sales volumes, the continued impact of cost reduction programs and currency appreciation. Lower volumes are expected to continue into the first quarter of 2009 due to significant customer shut downs. Sales for 2007 increased $182 million, or 16%, versus 2006. Volume growth of 4% was due to new business in Spain and Germany and strong homecare and packaged gas sales in Spain. Realized price increases of 3% included the pass through of higher energy and power costs. Currency appreciation contributed 9% to sales growth. Operating profit for 2007 increased $49 million, or 18%, versus 2006. Operating profit growth was driven by increased sales volumes, the continued impact of cost reduction programs and currency appreciation. In November 2007, Praxair acquired a 50% interest in the industrial gases business of Yara International ASA of Norway. This joint venture, Yara Praxair AS, is accounted for as an equity investment in the consolidated financial statements.

(White Martins), the largest industrial gases company in Brazil. White Martins also manages Praxairs operations in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela. Sales for 2008 increased $285 million, or 18%, versus 2007. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 12% for the year primarily due to higher sales in the manufacturing, healthcare and food and beverage markets and realized price increases. Volume growth was mitigated by lower on site volumes to commodity producers and lower sales to export industries in the fourth quarter, particularly in metals and chemicals. Operating profit in 2008 increased $78 million, or 25%, versus 2007. Operating profit for 2008 included currency related net gains of $8 million which primarily consisted of net income hedge gains (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements). Excluding the impact of the currency related net gains in 2008, operating profit increased $70 million, or 23%. 2008 operating profit also included amounts related to various contingencies in Brazil reflecting current developments which, on a net basis, were not significant. Underlying operating profit growth was due to strong organic growth in the first three quarters across all major end markets. Currency appreciation also contributed to operating profit growth in 2008. Significantly lower volumes are expected in the first quarter of 2009 due to anticipated large customer shut downs. 28 Table of Contents Sales for 2007 increased $256 million, or 19%, versus 2006. 2006 included an equipment sale to a Venezuela customer. Excluding the equipment sale in 2006 and currency appreciation, sales increased 12%, primarily due to higher sales in the manufacturing, metals and food and beverage markets and realized price increases. Operating profit in 2007 increased $59 million, or 23%, versus 2006. Increased volumes, the continued impact of cost reduction programs, and higher pricing, which outpaced inflationary pressures, all contributed to operating profit growth. Currency also contributed to operating profit growth in 2007. Asia % Changefrom Prior Year 2008 2007 Sales Volume 11 % 11 % Price 8 % Currency 6 % Total Asia sales change 19 % 17 % The Asia segment includes Praxairs industrial gases operations in China, India, Korea and Thailand, with smaller operations in Japan, Malaysia and Taiwan. Sales for 2008 increased $145 million, or 19%, versus 2007. Volume growth of 11% was due to higher on site and merchant sales in most major end markets due to new business and new plant start ups. Price increases contributed 8% to sales. Higher pricing for rare and specialty gases due to strong demand and tight supply for certain products contributed to these increases. Operating profit for 2008 increased $28 million, or 23%, versus 2007. Increased sales volumes and productivity initiatives were the primary drivers of operating profit growth. A slowdown in volumes is expected for the first quarter of 2009 due to the Chinese New Year and extended holiday shut downs. Sales for 2007 increased $110 million, or 17%, versus 2006. Excluding the impact of currency appreciation, sales increased 11% due to strong sales to the electronics, metals and manufacturing markets in China, India and Korea. Operating profit for 2007 increased $10 million, or 9%, versus 2006. Increased sales volumes and productivity initiatives were the primary drivers of operating profit growth partially offset by increased operating costs due to the ramp up in staffing to support new projects expected to start up over the next several years.

Sales for 2008 increased $53 million, or 10%, versus 2007. Underlying growth was due to strong coatings volumes for industrial gas turbines and oilfield drilling parts and realized price increases, partially offset by lower coatings volumes to the aviation markets due to delays in the production of plane engines. Currency appreciation, primarily in Europe, contributed 5% to sales growth. Operating profit for 2008 increased $4 million, or 4%, versus 2007. Increased sales volumes and productivity initiatives were the primary drivers of operating profit growth. Sales for 2007 increased $41 million, or 9%, versus 2006. Sales increased 16% excluding the impact of the divestiture of its aviation services business in July 2006. The strong sales growth was primarily due to higher volumes of industrial coatings for power turbines and OEM aircraft engine parts and realized price increases. Currency appreciation, primarily in Europe, contributed 5% to sales growth. Operating profit for 2007 increased $24 million, or 35%, versus 2006. 2006 included a gain of $7 million from the aviation services divestiture. Excluding the gain from the aviation services divestiture in 2006, underlying operating profit increased $31 million, or 51%. The increase was principally driven by volume growth as well as the favorable benefits of ongoing cost reduction actions and pricing actions to offset increasing raw material costs. 30 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND OTHER FINANCIAL DATA (Millions of dollars) Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net Cash Provided by (Used for) Operating Activities Net income plus depreciation and amortization $ 2,061 $ 1,951 $ 1,684 Working capital 63 (179 ) 103 Cost reduction program and other charges, net of payments 149 Pension contributions (20 ) (22 ) (126 ) Other net (215 ) 208 91 Total provided by operating activities $ 2,038 $ 1,958 $ 1,752 Investing Activities Capital expenditures $ (1,611 ) $ (1,376 ) $ (1,100 ) Acquisitions (130 ) (476 ) (14 ) Divestitures and asset sales 54 39 126 Total used for investing $ (1,687 ) $ (1,813 ) $ (988 ) Financing Activities Debt increases (reductions) net $ 987 $ 795 $ (378 ) Issuances (purchases) of stock net (892 ) (636 ) (220 ) Cash dividends (468 ) (381 ) (323 ) Excess tax benefit on stock option exercises 54 63 29 Minority interest transactions and other (14 ) (11 ) (13 ) Total used for financing $ (333 ) $ (170 ) $ (905 ) Other Financial Data (a) Debt to capital ratio 53.8 % 43.4 % 39.9 % After tax return on capital 15.3 % 15.3 % 14.6 % (a) Non GAAP measures.

The increase was principally a result of the reduction in working capital, higher net income and higher depreciation and amortization partially offset by tax payments in 2008 included in Other net. 2007 compared with 2006 Cash flow from operations increased $206 million to $1,958 million in 2007 from $1,752 million in 2006. The increase was principally a result of higher net income and lower pension contributions compared with 2006, partially offset by working capital growth related to the strong sales increase and increased income tax payments. Investing 2008 compared with 2007 Net cash used for investing activities of $1,687 million in 2008 decreased $126 million versus 2007. The decrease was primarily due to lower acquisitions spending partially offset by higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures in 2008 were $1,611 million, an increase of $235 million from 2007. This increase reflects new investment in customer on site supply systems supported by long term customer contracts primarily in North America, South America and Asia. 32 Table of Contents Acquisition expenditures in 2008 were $130 million, a decrease of $346 million from 2007. 2008 included the acquisition of Kirk Welding Supply Inc., an independent packaged gas distributor in the United States, and several small acquisitions in North America, Europe and South America. 2007 included several larger acquisitions including an industrial gas business in Mexico, an independent packaged gas distributor in the United States and the acquisition of a 50% interest in an industrial gas business in Norway (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). Divestitures and asset sales in 2008 totaled $54 million, an increase of $15 million from 2007. 2008 includes the proceeds from the divestiture of the industrial gas business in Israel. On a worldwide basis, capital expenditures for 2009 are expected to be in the range of $1,400 million to $1,500 million. By region, over half of forecasted capital expenditures will be for projects in North America, the largest of which are energy related hydrogen projects. The second largest region for investment is Asia, driven by two large oxygen plants in China to supply coal gasifiers for chemicals customers. The company also has a large number of projects in South America supplying metals, manufacturing, paper, electronics and chemicals customers. The pace of new project proposals has slowed due to the uncertain economic environment, however, the company has a strong backlog of projects under contract with customers that are expected to be completed and come on stream in 2009 through 2011. 2007 compared with 2006 Net cash used for investing activities of $1,813 million in 2007 increased $825 million versus 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher capital expenditures and acquisitions. Capital expenditures in 2007 were $1,376 million, an increase of $276 million from 2006. This increase reflects new investment in customer on site supply systems supported by long term customer contracts primarily in North America, South America and Asia. Acquisition expenditures in 2007 were $476 million, an increase of $462 million from 2006 levels primarily due to the acquisitions of Linde AGs industrial gas business in Mexico and Mittler Supply Inc., an independent packaged gas distributor in the United States in the first quarter of 2007, and the acquisition of a 50% interest in the industrial gas business of Yara International ASA of Norway in the fourth quarter of 2007 (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). Divestitures and asset sales in 2007 totaled $39 million, a decrease of $87 million from 2006. 2006 included the proceeds from the divestiture of the aviation services business and a Turkish joint venture. 33 Table of Contents Financing Praxairs financing strategy is to secure long term committed funding at attractive interest rates by issuing U.S. public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by long term bank credit agreements. Its international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and inter company funding to minimize the total cost of funds and to manage and centralize currency exchange exposures. As deemed necessary, Praxair manages its exposure to interest rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk). The current United States credit environment has not had, and at this time is not expected to have, a significant adverse impact on the companys liquidity. The company continues to have access to the commercial paper markets, and expects to continue to generate strong operating cash flows. While the impact of continued volatility in the global credit markets cannot be predicted with certainty, the company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2008, the companys credit ratings as reported by Standard & Poors and Moodys were A 1 and P 1 for short term debt, respectively, and A and A 2 for long term debt, respectively. Additionally, the company plans to maintain its undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries to support foreign growth opportunities and reduce local debt. Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the companys current debt position and available credit facilities. Such credit facilities are with major financial institutions and are non cancellable until maturity. Therefore, the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be very low. Praxairs major bank credit and long term debt agreements contain standard financial covenants which the company is in compliance with at December 31, 2008 and expects to remain in compliance with for the foreseeable future. Cash used for financing activities was $333 million in 2008 compared to $170 million in 2007. This increase was primarily due an increase in purchases of common stock, net of issuances and higher dividends, partially offset by an increase in net debt borrowings. Cash dividends of $468 million increased $87 million, or 23%, versus 2007 ($1.50 per share for 2008 compared to $1.20 per share 2007). On July 23, 2008, the companys board of directors approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program authorizing the company to repurchase shares from time to time on the open market or through negotiated transactions, subject to market and business conditions. Share repurchases under this program are expected to be completed over the next two years and will be financed by available cash and debt. This program is in addition to the $1 billion share repurchase program approved in July 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the 2007 program had 34 Table of Contents been completed and $622 million of share repurchases had been completed under the 2008 program, leaving an additional $378 million remaining authorized for purchase. At December 31, 2008, Praxairs total debt outstanding was $5,025 million, $833 million higher than $4,192 million at December 31, 2007. The increase in debt was primarily to fund share repurchases and capital expenditures during 2008. The December 31, 2008 debt balance includes $3,777 million in public securities and $1,248 million representing primarily worldwide bank borrowings. Praxairs global effective borrowing rate was approximately 5% for 2008. Other Financial Data Praxairs debt to capital ratio increased to 53.8% at December 31, 2008 versus 43.4% at December 31, 2007. The increase is due to higher debt levels related primarily to net stock repurchases and a decrease in shareholders equity due to currency and pension asset movements reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income (loss). After tax return on capital in 2008 remained flat with 2007 at 15.3%. Earnings growth was in line with the increase in capital. See the Non GAAP Financial Measures section for definitions and reconciliation of these non GAAP measures to reported amounts. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth Praxairs material contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2008: (millions of dollars) Due or expiring by December 31, 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Long term debt obligations Debt and capitalized lease maturities $ 674 $ 56 $ 1,011 $ 653 $ 354 $ 1,635 $ 4,383 Contractual interest 151 138 136 106 89 163 783 Operating leases 89 74 55 42 35 87 382 Retirement obligations 128 26 26 26 27 140 373 Unconditional purchase obligations 350 238 163 137 91 362 1,341 Construction commitments 925 408 8 1,341 Guarantees and other 145 58 11 214 Total Contractual Obligations $ 2,462 $ 998 $ 1,399 $ 964 $ 596 $ 2,398 $ 8,817 Long term debt and capitalized lease maturities of $4,383 million are more fully described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements and are included on the companys balance sheet as long term liabilities. $1,137 million of commercial paper has been reflected in 2011 and 2012 maturities due to the companys intent and ability to refinance this debt on a long term basis. Contractual interest on long term debt of $783 million represents interest the company is contracted to pay on outstanding long term debt and capital lease obligations, calculated on a basis consistent with planned debt maturities. At December 31, 2008, Praxair had fixed rate debt of $2,677 million and floating rate debt of $2,348 million. The rate assumed for floating rate debt was the rate in effect at December 31, 2008. Obligations under operating leases of $382 million represent non cancelable contractual obligations primarily for manufacturing and distribution equipment and office space. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further details. 35 Table of Contents Retirement obligations of $373 million include estimates of pension plan contributions and expected future benefit payments for unfunded pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions (OPEB). Pension plan contributions are forecast through 2009 only. For purposes of the table, $100 million has been included for 2009 based on the range of $70 million to $100 million. Expected future unfunded pension and OPEB benefit payments are forecast through 2018. Contribution and unfunded benefit payment estimates are based upon current valuation assumptions. Estimates of pension contributions after 2009 and unfunded benefit payments after 2018 are not included in the table because the timing of their resolution cannot be estimated. Retirement obligations are more fully described in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. Unconditional purchase obligations of $1,341 million represent contractual commitments under various long and short term take or pay arrangements with suppliers. These obligations are primarily minimum purchase commitments for helium, electricity, natural gas and feedstock used to produce atmospheric gases, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. During 2008, payments under these contracts totaled $1,153 million, including $484 million for electricity and $456 million for natural gas. A significant portion of these obligations is passed on to customers through similar take or pay contractual arrangements. Purchase obligations that are not passed along to customers do not represent a significant risk to Praxair. Construction commitments of $1,341 million represent outstanding commitments to customers or suppliers to complete authorized construction projects as of December 31, 2008. A significant portion of Praxairs capital spending is related to the construction of new production facilities to satisfy customer commitments which may take a year or more to complete. Significant commitments include two large hydrogen plants to supply hydrogen and steam to BPs refinery complex in Whiting, Indiana and a large hydrogen plant in northern California to supply Chevrons Richmond Refinery. Guarantees and other of $214 million include $70 million relating to Praxairs contingent obligations under guarantees of certain debt of unconsolidated affiliates, $108 million relating to put option agreements with certain affiliated companies and $36 million of various guarantees relating to outstanding receivables and repurchase agreements. Unconsolidated equity investees had total debt of approximately $489 million at December 31, 2008, which was non recourse to Praxair with the exception of the guaranteed portions described above. The put option agreements are primarily related to majority owned packaged gas subsidiaries in the United States and give the minority shareholders the right to require Praxair to purchase their shares at a predefined price calculation. Praxair has no financing arrangements with closely held related parties. Undrawn outstanding letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds valued at approximately $944 million from financial institutions are not included in the table because the timing of their resolution cannot be estimated. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. Long term FIN 48 tax liabilities totaling $305 million, including related interests and penalties, are not included in the table because the timing of their resolution cannot be estimated. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures surrounding uncertain income tax positions under FIN 48. Also, see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for more information concerning commitments and contingencies. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding Praxairs financial statements and accompanying Notes prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). Their application places significant importance on managements judgment as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Praxairs financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected if actual results differ from estimates made. These policies are determined by management and have been reviewed by Praxairs Audit Committee. 36 Table of Contents Depreciable Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment Praxairs net property, plant and equipment at December 31, 2008 was $7,922 million, representing 61% of the companys consolidated total assets. Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $827 million, or 9% of total operating costs. Management judgment is required in the determination of the estimated depreciable lives that are used to calculate the annual depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation. Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over the assets estimated useful lives on a straight line basis for financial reporting purposes. The estimated useful life represents the projected period of time that the asset will be productively employed by the company and is determined by management based on many factors, including historical experience with similar assets, technological life cycles, geographic locations and contractual supply relationships with on site customers. Circumstances and events relating to these assets, such as on site contract modifications, are monitored to ensure that changes in asset lives or impairments (see Asset Impairment) are identified and prospective depreciation expense or impairment expense is adjusted accordingly. Praxairs largest asset values relate to cryogenic air separation production plants with depreciable lives of principally 15 years. Based upon the assets as of December 31, 2008, if depreciable lives of machinery and equipment, on average, were increased or decreased by one year, annual depreciation expense would be decreased by approximately $37 million or increased by approximately $41 million, respectively. Pension Benefits Pension benefits represent financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements. Because of the uncertainties involved in estimating the timing and amount of future payments, significant estimates are required to calculate pension expense and liabilities related to the companys plans. The company utilizes the services of several independent actuaries, whose models are used to facilitate these calculations. Several key assumptions are used in actuarial models to calculate pension expense and liability amounts recorded in the financial statements. Management believes the three most significant variables in the models are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate, and the expected rate of compensation increase. The actuarial models also use assumptions for various other factors, including employee turnover, retirement age, and mortality. Praxair management believes the assumptions used in the actuarial calculations are reasonable, reflect the companys experience and expectations for the future and are within accepted practices in each of the respective geographic locations in which it operates. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors. The weighted average expected long term rates of return on pension plan assets were 8.25% for U.S. plans and 8.50% for international plans for the year ended December 31, 2008 (8.25% and 8.70%, respectively, at December 31, 2007). These rates are determined annually by management based on a weighted average of current and historical market trends, historical and expected portfolio performance and the current and expected portfolio mix of investments. A 0.50% change in these expected long term rates of return, with all other variables held constant, would change Praxairs pension expense by approximately $8 million. The company has consistently used a market related value of assets rather than the fair value at the measurement date to determine annual pension expense. The market related value recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets from year to year are not immediately reflected in the companys annual pension expense. Instead, annual pension expense in future periods will be impacted as deferred investment gains or losses are recognized in the market related value of assets over the five year period. Due to the recent decline in the fair value of pension assets, the consolidated market related value of assets was $1,524 million, or $412 million higher than the fair value of assets of $1,112 million at December 31, 2008. 37 Table of Contents These net deferred investment losses of $412 million will be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets ratably over the next four years and will impact future pension expense annually through 2013. Future actual investment gains or losses will impact the market related value of assets and, therefore, will impact future annual pension expense in a similar manner. The weighted average discount rates for pension plan liabilities were 6.50% for U.S. plans and 8.20% for international plans at December 31, 2008 (6.20% and 6.85%, respectively, at December 31, 2007). These rates are used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities and are determined annually by management. The discount rate for the U.S. plan is established utilizing a bond matching model provided by the companys independent actuaries. The portfolio of bonds includes only corporate bonds graded AA by Moodys or Standard & Poors and matches the U.S. plans projected cash flows to the spot rates and calculates the single equivalent discount rate which produces the same present value. The discount rates for the remaining international plans are based on market yields for high quality fixed income investments representing the approximate duration of the pension liabilities on the measurement date. A 0.50% change in discount rates, with all other variables held constant, would change Praxairs pension expense by approximately $12 million and would impact the projected benefit obligation (PBO) by approximately $97 million. The weighted average expected rate of compensation increase was 3.25% for U.S. plans and 4.00% for international plans at December 31, 2008 (3.50% and 3.00%, respectively, at December 31, 2007). The estimated annual compensation increase is determined by management every year and is based on historical trends and market indices. A 0.50% change in the expected rate of compensation increase, with all other variables held constant, would change Praxairs pension expense by approximately $10 million and would impact the PBO by approximately $39 million. Asset Impairment Goodwill At December 31, 2008, the company had goodwill of $1,909 million, which represents the aggregate of the excess purchase price for acquired businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The company performs a goodwill impairment test annually in the second quarter or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, and no impairments were indicated. Due to the significant recessionary business environment in 2008 and the resulting drop in market values for most companies, including Praxair, the company has continuously re evaluated the likelihood of goodwill impairments in its reporting units subsequent to the second quarter test, and does not believe there is indication of impairment. At December 31, 2008, Praxairs enterprise value was approximately $23 billion (outstanding shares multiplied by the year end stock price plus debt, and without any control premium) while its total capital was $9 billion. The impairment test requires that the company estimate and compare the fair value of its reporting units to their carrying value, including goodwill. Reporting units are determined in accordance with the guidance in SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and generally are at a level below the reportable segments. Fair value is determined through the use of projected future cash flows, multiples of earnings and sales and other factors. Such analysis requires the use of certain future market assumptions and discount factors, which are subjective in nature. Estimated values can be affected by many factors beyond the companys control such as business and economic trends, government regulation, and technological changes. Management believes that the assumptions used to determine fair value are appropriate and reasonable. However, changes in circumstances or conditions affecting these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value determination, which could then result in a material impairment charge to the companys results of operations. 38 Table of Contents See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures concerning the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is tested for impairment in accordance with FAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an individual asset or asset group may not be recoverable. To assess recoverability, the company compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from the asset or asset group to the carrying amount of the asset or asset group. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment charge reducing the carrying amount to fair value is required. Fair value is determined based on the most appropriate valuation technique, including discounted cash flows. This analysis requires management to make various subjective estimates and assumptions, including the amount of projected future cash flows related to the asset or asset group, the useful life over which cash flows will occur and the assets residual value, if any. Income Taxes At December 31, 2008, Praxair had deferred tax assets of $634 million (net of valuation allowances of $245 million), and deferred tax liabilities of $1,058 million. Income tax expense was $465 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Effective January 1, 2007, the company adopted FIN 48 which provides a comprehensive model for the recognition, measurement and disclosure in financial statements of uncertain income tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. At December 31, 2008, such uncertain tax positions totaled $312 million (see Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements). In the preparation of consolidated financial statements, Praxair estimates income taxes based on diverse legislative and regulatory structures that exist in various jurisdictions where the company conducts business. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent tax benefits or obligations that arise from temporary differences due to differing treatment of certain items for accounting and income tax purposes. Praxair evaluates deferred tax assets each period to ensure that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character (e.g. capital gain versus ordinary income treatment), amount and timing to result in their recovery. A valuation allowance is established when management determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized to reduce the assets to their realizable value. Considerable judgments are required in establishing deferred tax valuation allowances and in assessing exposures related to tax matters. As events and circumstances change, related reserves and valuation allowances are adjusted to income at that time. Praxairs tax returns are subject to audit and local taxing authorities could challenge the companys tax positions. The companys practice is to review tax filing positions by jurisdiction and to record provisions for uncertain income tax positions as required by FIN 48, including interest and penalties when applicable. Praxair believes it records and or discloses such potential tax liabilities as appropriate and has reasonably estimated its income tax liabilities and recoverable tax assets. If new information becomes available, adjustments are charged against income at that time. Management does not anticipate that such adjustments would have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on the companys reported results of operations. Contingencies In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, the company accrues liabilities for non income tax contingencies when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, while contingent gains are recognized only when realized. If new information becomes 39 Table of Contents available or losses are sustained in excess of recorded amounts, adjustments are charged against income at that time. Management does not anticipate that in the aggregate such losses would have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on the companys reported results of operations. Praxair is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. These actions are based upon alleged environmental, tax, antitrust and personal injury claims, among others (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements). Such contingencies are significant and the accounting requires considerable management judgments in analyzing each matter to assess the likely outcome and the need for establishing appropriate liabilities and providing adequate disclosures. Praxair believes it records and or discloses such potential contingencies as appropriate and has reasonably estimated its liabilities. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning new accounting standards and the impact of the implementation of these standards on the companys financial statements. Fair Value Measurements Praxair does not expect changes in the aggregate fair value of its financial assets and liabilities to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The company presents the following non GAAP financial measures in Items 6 and 7 of this annual report on Form 10 K.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Praxair is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The objective of financial risk management at Praxair is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the companys earnings, cash flows and equity. To manage these risks, Praxair uses various derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, currency swaps, forward contracts, currency options and commodity contracts. Praxair only uses commonly traded and non leveraged instruments. These contracts are entered into primarily with major banking institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. Also, see Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of Praxairs accounting policies and use of such instruments. The following discussion presents the sensitivity of the market value, earnings and cash flows of Praxairs financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest and exchange rates assuming these changes occurred at December 31, 2008. The range of changes chosen for these discussions reflect Praxairs view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period. Market values represent the present values of projected future cash flows based on interest rate and exchange rate assumptions. Interest Rate and Debt Sensitivity Analysis At December 31, 2008, Praxair had debt totaling $5,025 million ($4,192 million at December 31, 2007). There were no interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007. When considered necessary, interest rate swaps are entered into as hedges of underlying financial instruments to effectively change the characteristics of the interest rate without actually changing the underlying financial instrument. For fixed rate instruments, interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for floating rate instruments, interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but impact future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. At December 31, 2008, Praxair had fixed rate debt of $2,677 million and floating rate debt of $2,348 million, representing 53% and 47%, respectively, of total debt. At December 31, 2007, Praxair had fixed rate debt of $2,552 million and floating rate debt of $1,640 million, representing 61% and 39%, respectively, of total debt. Holding other variables constant (such as foreign exchange rates, swaps and debt levels), a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would increase the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately $128 million ($116 million in 2007). At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the after tax earnings and cash flows impact for the subsequent year resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates would be approximately $16 million and $11 million, respectively, holding other variables constant. Exchange Rate Sensitivity Analysis Praxairs exchange rate exposures result primarily from its investments and ongoing operations in South America (primarily Brazil, Argentina and Colombia), Europe (primarily Italy, Spain and Germany), Canada, Mexico, Asia (primarily China, India, Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand) and other business transactions such as the procurement of equipment from foreign sources. Among other techniques, Praxair utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts and options to hedge these exposures. At December 31, 2008, Praxair had $636 million notional amount ($776 million at December 31, 2007) of foreign exchange contracts of which $616 million ($606 million in 2007) were to hedge recorded balance sheet exposures and $20 million ($170 million in 2007) were to hedge anticipated future net income. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Holding other variables constant, if there were a 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates for the portfolio, the fair market value of foreign currency contracts outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007 would decrease by approximately $1 million and $8 million, respectively, which would be largely offset by an offsetting gain or loss on the foreign currency fluctuation of the underlying exposure being hedged. 44 Table of Contents
