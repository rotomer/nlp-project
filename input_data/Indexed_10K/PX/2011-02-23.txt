The companys primary products are oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide, helium, electronic gases and a wide range of specialty gases. Praxair Surface Technologies supplies high performance coatings that protect metal parts from wear, corrosion and high heat. Praxairs industrial gas operations are managed on a geographical basis and in 2010, 94% of sales were generated in four geographic segments (North America, Europe, South America, and Asia). The surface technologies segment generated the remaining 6% of sales. Praxair serves approximately 25 industries as diverse as healthcare and petroleum refining; computer chip manufacturing and beverage carbonation; fiber optics and steel making; and aerospace, chemicals and water treatment. The diversity of end markets creates financial stability for Praxair in varied business cycles. Praxair generates most of its revenues and earnings through the following 11 core geographies where the company has its strongest market positions and where distribution and production operations allow the company to deliver the highest level of service to its customers at the lowest cost. North America South America Europe Asia United States Brazil Spain China Canada Italy India Mexico Germany/Benelux Thailand Korea Praxair manufactures and distributes its products through a network of hundreds of production plants, pipeline complexes, distribution centers and delivery vehicles. Major pipeline complexes are located in the United States, Brazil, Spain and Germany. These networks are a competitive advantage, providing the foundation of reliable product supply to the companys customer base. The majority of Praxairs business is conducted through long term contracts which provide stability in cash flow and the ability to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers. The company has significant growth opportunities in diverse markets including: hydrogen for refining; oxygen for gasification and oxy fuel applications; and nitrogen and carbon dioxide for oil and gas production. 16 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FINANCIAL RESULTS & OUTLOOK Adjusted Amounts and Comparisons The discussion of consolidated results and outlook in this Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is based on adjusted amounts and comparisons with adjusted amounts. Adjusted amounts are non GAAP measures that supplement an understanding of the companys financial information by presenting information that investors, financial analysts and management use to help evaluate the companys performance and ongoing business trends on a comparable basis. See the Consolidated Results section of this MD&A for a summary of these adjusted amounts. A reconciliation of reported amounts to adjusted amounts can be found in the Non GAAP Financial Measures section of this MD&A. 2010 Year in review Praxair delivered strong financial performance in 2010. Sales were up 13% with adjusted diluted earnings per share up 19% versus 2009. Sales growth was driven by higher volumes in all geographies and major end markets. Adjusted operating profit grew 15% by leveraging volume growth from economic recovery and new plant start ups with continued productivity gains and cost reduction efforts. The company continued to invest in capital projects for future growth and established a presence in two growing geographies, Russia and the Middle East. Sales increased 13% to $10,116 million versus $8,956 million in 2009, due primarily to strong volume growth in all geographic segments. Reported operating profit of $2,082 million increased from $1,575 million in 2009. Adjusted operating profit of $2,167 increased 15% from 2009. Operating profit grew faster than sales from higher volumes and continued leverage from productivity and cost reduction programs. Reported net income Praxair, Inc. of $1,195 million and diluted earnings per share of $3.84, decreased from $1,254 million and $4.01, respectively, in 2009. Adjusted net income Praxair, Inc. and diluted earnings per share increased 18% and 19% from 2009, respectively. Cash flow from operations was $1,905 million, including the Spanish income tax settlement payment of $481 million in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were $1,388 million, primarily for the construction of new on site production plants under contract with customers around the world. Acquisition expenditures of $148 million were primarily related to the purchase of an equity interest in ROC, a leading industrial gas business with operations in Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. 2011 Outlook Sales are forecasted in the area of $11 billion. Reported diluted earnings per share are forecasted to be in the range of $5.25 to $5.40. This represents an increase of 11% to 14% from the 2010 adjusted diluted earnings per share. Effective tax rate of about 28%. Capital expenditures in the range of $1.5 to $1.8 billion. The above guidance should be read in conjunction with the section entitled Forward Looking Statements. Praxair provides quarterly updates on operating results, material trends that may affect financial performance, and financial earnings guidance via earnings releases and investor teleconferences. These materials are available on the companys website, www.praxair.com, but are not incorporated herein. 17 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED RESULTS AND OTHER INFORMATION The following table provides selected data for 2010, 2009, and 2008: Variance (Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data) Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs.2009 2009 vs.2008 Reported Amounts: Sales $ 10,116 $ 8,956 $ 10,796 13 % (17 )% Gross margin (a) $ 4,362 $ 3,924 $ 4,301 11 % (9 )% As a percent of sales 43.1 % 43.8 % 39.8 % Selling, general and administrative $ 1,196 $ 1,088 $ 1,312 10 % (17 )% As a percent of sales 11.8 % 12.1 % 12.2 % Depreciation and amortization $ 925 $ 846 $ 850 9 % % Brazil tax amnesty program and other charges (b) $ 85 $ 306 $ 194 Other income (expenses) net $ 5 $ (35 ) $ 35 Operating profit $ 2,082 $ 1,575 $ 1,883 32 % (16 )% As a percent of sales 20.6 % 17.6 % 17.4 % Interest expense net $ 118 $ 133 $ 198 (11 )% (33 )% Effective tax rate 39.1 % 11.7 % 27.6 % Net income Praxair, Inc. $ 1,195 $ 1,254 $ 1,211 (5 )% 4 % Diluted earnings per share $ 3.84 $ 4.01 $ 3.80 (4 )% 6 % Diluted shares outstanding 311,395 312,382 318,302 % (2 )% Number of employees 26,261 26,164 26,936 % (3 )% Adjusted Amounts (c): Operating profit $ 2,167 $ 1,881 $ 2,077 15 % (9 )% As a percent of sales 21.4 % 21.0 % 19.2 % Effective tax rate 27.9 % 27.6 % 28.2 % Net income Praxair, Inc. $ 1,476 $ 1,247 $ 1,336 18 % (7 )% Diluted earnings per share $ 4.74 $ 3.99 $ 4.20 19 % (5 )% (a) Gross margin excludes depreciation and amortization expense. (b) See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. (c) Adjusted amounts are non GAAP measures. Variances are calculated using adjusted amounts, where indicated. Non GAAP adjustments are summarized below and a reconciliation of reported amounts to adjusted amounts can be found in the Non GAAP Financial Measures section of this MD&A. The following items were recorded in the consolidated financial statements: Year Ended December 31, 2010 (Millions of dollars) Operating Profit(Loss) Income TaxProvision (Benefit) Net Income(Loss) Spanish income tax settlement $ $ 250 $ (250 ) US homecare divestiture (58 ) (18 ) (40 ) Repatriation tax benefit (35 ) 35 Venezuela currency devaluation (27 ) (1 ) (26 ) Total $ (85 ) $ 196 $ (281 ) 18 Table of Contents Spanish Income Tax Settlement During the fourth quarter 2010, the Companys Spanish subsidiaries settled various income tax disputes with the Spanish Government. As a result, Praxair recorded an income tax charge of $250 million representing the settlement amount in excess of previously recorded expenses. The settlement requires cash payments of approximately $500 million, $481 million of which was paid in the fourth quarter 2010. The remaining amounts are expected to be paid in 2011. US Homecare Divestiture During the fourth quarter 2010, the company announced its intent to sell the U.S. homecare portion of its North American healthcare business and recorded a pre tax charge of $58 million ($40 million after tax) representing an adjustment to estimated fair value. On February 2, 2011, the company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement for sale of the U.S. homecare business to Apria Healthcare Group Inc. The sale is expected to close in the first quarter of 2011. Repatriation Tax Benefit Also during the fourth quarter 2010, the company recognized an income tax benefit of $35 million related to the repatriation of highly taxed foreign earnings. Venezuela Currency Devaluation In the first quarter 2010, Praxair recorded a $27 million charge ($26 million after tax) due primarily to the remeasurement of the local Venezuelan balance sheet to reflect the new official 4.3 exchange rate (representing a 50% devaluation). Year Ended December 31, 2009 Brazil Tax Amnesty Program and Other Charges In the third quarter 2009, Praxair recorded a pre tax charge of $306 million (net after tax benefit of $7 million) related primarily to a Federal tax amnesty program in Brazil. The program required a cash outlay of $34 million in the 2009 fourth quarter and is expected to require up to an additional $60 million of cash payments in the next twelve months depending on timing of the Brazilian government consolidation process. Year Ended December 31, 2008 Cost Reduction Program and Other Charges In 2008, Praxair recorded pre tax charges totaling $194 million ($125 million after tax and noncontrolling interests or $0.40 per diluted share), including $118 million related to severance and other exit costs in response to the economic downturn. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of these items. Results of Operations As previously described, references to adjusted amounts refer to reported amounts adjusted to exclude the impact of non GAAP adjustments and are non GAAP measures. A reconciliation of reported amounts to adjusted amounts can be found in the Non GAAP Financial Measures section of this MD&A. 19 Table of Contents 2010 Compared With 2009 % Change from Prior Year 2010 2009 Sales Volume 9 % (10 )% Price/Mix/Other % 2 % Cost pass through 1 % (4 )% Currency 2 % (5 )% Acquisitions/Divestitures 1 % % Total sales change 13 % (17 )% Sales in 2010 increased $1,160 million, or 13% versus 2009. Excluding the impacts of currency, cost pass through and acquisitions/divestitures, sales increased primarily due to 9% volume growth. The favorable impact of currency, primarily in South America, Canada and Mexico, increased sales by 2%. Higher cost pass through increased sales by 1%, with a negligible impact on operating profit. Gross margin in 2010 improved $438 million, or 11%, versus 2009. The decrease in the gross margin percentage to 43.1% in 2010 versus 43.8% in 2009 was due primarily to higher cost pass through to customers. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2010 were $1,196 million, or 11.8% of sales, versus $1,088 million, or 12.1% of sales, for 2009. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales was due to realized benefits from ongoing productivity initiatives. Depreciation and amortization expense in 2010 increased $79 million versus 2009. The increase was due to increased depreciation associated with project start ups and currency impacts. Other income (expenses) net in 2010 was a $5 million benefit versus a $(35) million expense in 2009. The change in 2010 versus 2009 was primarily due to negative currency related items in 2009 and a benefit from an amnesty program in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 2010. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the major components of Other income (expenses) net. Adjusted operating profit of $2,167 million in 2010 was $286 million, or 15%, higher than adjusted operating profit of $1,881 million in 2009. As a percentage of sales, adjusted operating profit improved to 21.4% in 2010 versus 21.0% in 2009. This improvement is a result of strong volume recovery in all geographies and the continued impact of productivity and cost reduction initiatives. Interest expense net in 2010 decreased $15 million, or 11% versus 2009 due to lower interest rates on variable rate debt during 2010 and higher capitalized interest. The adjusted effective tax rate for 2010 was 27.9%, versus 27.6% in 2009, which was essentially unchanged. Praxairs significant sources of equity income are from companies based in China, Italy, the Middle East and Norway. The companys share of net income from equity investments increased $14 million in 2010 related primarily to higher earnings in Italy (including a tax benefit), China and Norway and the acquisition of ROC in the Middle East in 2010. At December 31, 2010, noncontrolling interests consisted primarily of noncontrolling shareholders investments in Asia (primarily in China and India), Europe (primarily in Italy), and North America (primarily within the U.S. packaged gas business). The $4 million decrease in noncontrolling interests in 2010 was due primarily to a tax on the distribution of earnings in India and negative currency effects. 20 Table of Contents Adjusted net income Praxair, Inc. of $1,476 million in 2010 was $229 million, or 18%, higher than adjusted net income Praxair, Inc. of $1,247 million in 2009. The increase was due to higher operating profit, higher income from equity investments and lower interest expense. Adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $4.74 in 2010 increased $0.75 per diluted share, or 19%, from adjusted diluted EPS of $3.99 in 2009. The underlying increase in adjusted diluted EPS was due to higher net income Praxair, Inc. and the lower number of diluted shares outstanding due to the impact of the companys net repurchases of common stock during 2010. The number of employees at December 31, 2010 was 26,261, reflecting an increase of 97 employees from December 31, 2009. 2009 compared with 2008 % Change from Prior Year 2009 2008 Sales Volume (10 )% 3 % Price/Mix/Other 2 % 4 % Cost pass through (4 )% 3 % Currency (5 )% 3 % Acquisitions/Divestitures % 2 % Total sales change (17 )% 15 % Sales in 2009 decreased $1,840 million, or 17% versus 2008. Excluding the impacts of currency and cost pass through, sales declined 8% reflecting significantly lower volumes in most geographies due to lower demand consistent with the global economic slowdown partially offset by higher overall pricing. The unfavorable impact of currency, primarily in South America, Europe, Mexico and Canada, decreased sales by 5%. Lower cost pass through decreased sales by 4%, with a negligible impact on operating profit. Gross margin in 2009 decreased $377 million, or 9%, versus 2008. The increase in the gross margin percentage to 43.8% in 2009 versus 39.8% in 2008 was due to higher pricing, cost reductions and the impact from lower cost pass through. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2009 were $1,088 million, or 12.1% of sales, versus $1,312 million, or 12.2% of sales, for 2008. The decrease in SG&A expenses was due to cost savings resulting from the cost reduction program initiated in 2008, ongoing productivity programs and currency impacts. Depreciation and amortization expense in 2009 decreased $4 million versus 2008. The slight decrease was due to currency effects partially offset by the increased depreciation associated with project start ups. Other income (expenses) net in 2009 was a $(35) million expense versus a $35 million benefit in 2008. The change in 2009 versus 2008 was due to a decrease in partnership income and currency related items. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the major components of Other income (expenses) net. Adjusted operating profit of $1,881 million in 2009 was $196 million, or 9%, lower than adjusted operating profit of $2,077 million in 2008. As a percentage of sales, adjusted operating profit improved to 21.0% in 2009 versus 19.2% in 2008. This improvement is a result of significant cost reductions, higher pricing and the impact of lower cost pass through on sales. Interest expense net in 2009 decreased $65 million, or 33% versus 2008 due to lower interest rates on commercial paper and bank borrowings during 2009. 21 Table of Contents The adjusted effective tax rate for 2009 was 27.6%, versus 28.2% in 2008, which was essentially unchanged. Praxairs significant equity investments are in Italy, Norway, the United States and China. The companys share of net income from equity investments decreased $12 million in 2009 primarily related to lower earnings from all equity investments. At December 31, 2009, noncontrolling interests consisted primarily of noncontrolling shareholders investments in Asia (primarily in China and India), Europe (primarily in Italy), and North America (primarily within the U.S. packaged gas business). The $2 million decrease in noncontrolling interests in 2009 was due to $6 million of lower income partially offset by a $4 million impact related to the cost reduction program and other charges in 2008. Adjusted net income Praxair, Inc. of $1,247 million in 2009 was $89 million, or 7%, lower than adjusted net income Praxair, Inc. of $1,336 million in 2008. The decrease was due to lower operating profit and income from equity investments partially offset by lower interest expense. Adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.99 in 2009 decreased $0.21 per diluted share, or 5%, from adjusted diluted EPS of $4.20 in 2008. The underlying decrease in adjusted diluted EPS is in line with the decrease in net income Praxair, Inc. partially offset by the impact of the companys net repurchases of common stock during 2009. The number of employees at December 31, 2009 was 26,164, reflecting a decrease of 772 employees from December 31, 2008 primarily related to the 2008 cost reduction program partially offset by the additional employees related to the Sermatech acquisition. Related Party Transactions The companys related parties are primarily unconsolidated equity affiliates. The company did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated with independent parties. Environmental Matters Praxairs principal operations relate to the production and distribution of atmospheric and other industrial gases, which historically have not had a significant impact on the environment. However, worldwide costs relating to environmental protection may continue to grow due to increasingly stringent laws and regulations, and Praxairs ongoing commitment to rigorous internal standards. Climate Change Praxair operates in jurisdictions that have, or are developing, laws and or regulations to reduce or mitigate the perceived adverse effects of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and faces a highly uncertain regulatory environment in this area. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has promulgated rules requiring monitoring and controlling GHG emissions and one of these rules regulates GHG emissions from light duty vehicles and certain large manufacturing facilities, many of which are Praxair suppliers or customers. Among other impacts, such regulations are expected to raise the costs of energy, which is a significant cost for Praxair. Nevertheless, Praxairs customer contracts routinely provide rights to recover increased electricity, natural gas, and other costs that are incurred by the company. Praxair anticipates continued growth in its hydrogen business, as hydrogen is essential to refineries which use it to remove sulfur from transportation fuels in order to meet ambient air quality standards in the United States. Hydrogen production plants and a large number of other manufacturing and electricity generating plants 22 Table of Contents have been identified under California law as a source of carbon dioxide emissions and these plants have also become subject to recently promulgated cap and trade regulations in that state. Praxair believes it will be able to mitigate some potential costs through the terms of its product supply contracts; however, legislation that limits GHG emissions may impact growth in this area by increasing operating costs and or decreasing demand. To manage these potential business risks from potential GHG emission regulation, Praxair actively monitors current developments, evaluates the direct and indirect business risks, and takes appropriate actions. Among others, actions include: increasing relevant resources and training; consulting with vendors, insurance providers and industry experts; incorporating GHG provisions in commercial agreements; and conducting regular reviews of the business risks with management. Although there are considerable uncertainties, Praxair believes that the business risk from potential regulations can be effectively managed through its commercial contracts. Additionally, Praxair does not anticipate any material effects regarding its plant operations or business arising from potential physical risks of climate change. Also, Praxair continuously seeks opportunities to reduce its own energy use and GHG footprint. At the same time, governmental regulation of GHG and other emissions and the growth of renewable energy alternatives may provide Praxair with business opportunities. Praxair continues to develop new applications technologies that can lower emissions, including GHG emissions, in Praxairs processes and help customers lower energy consumption and increase product throughout. Stricter regulation of water quality in emerging economies such as China provide a growing market for a number of gases, e.g., oxygen for wastewater treatment. Renewable fuel standards in the European Union and U.S. create a market for second generation biofuels which are users of industrial gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen. Costs Relating to the Protection of the Environment Environmental protection costs in 2010 included approximately $18 million in capital expenditures and $28 million of expenses. Environmental protection expenditures decreased $3 million during 2010, primarily due to new projects coming on line. Praxair anticipates that future annual environmental protection expenditures will be similar to 2010, subject to any significant changes in existing laws and regulations. Based on historical results and current estimates, management does not believe that environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, the consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any given year. Legal Proceedings See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning legal proceedings. Retirement Benefits Pensions The net periodic benefit cost for the U.S. and International pension plans was $57 million in 2010, $43 million in 2009 and $54 million in 2008. Consolidated net periodic benefit cost included settlement charges of $3 million, $4 million and $17 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The funded status (pension benefit obligation (PBO) less the fair value of plan assets) for the U.S. plans improved $73 million to a deficit of $354 million at December 31, 2010 from a deficit of $427 million in 2009. This improvement in 2010 from 2009 was primarily due to cash contributions of $107 million and strong pension asset investment performance in 2010, partially offset by the increased PBO due to the use of a lower discount rate. The funded status deficit for the international plans decreased by $2 million at December 31, 2010 versus 2009 as the increase in plan assets was largely offset by an increase in the PBO from lower discount rates. 23 Table of Contents Global pension contributions were $124 million in 2010, $128 million in 2009 and $20 million in 2008. Estimates of 2011 contributions are in the range $70 million to $120 million. The increase in pension contributions in 2010 and 2009 versus 2008 was primarily due to the decline in the value of pension assets as a result of the 2008 performance of the global securities markets and lower discount rates. Praxair assumes an expected return on plan assets for 2011 in the U.S of 8.25%. In 2011, consolidated pension expense is expected to be approximately $60 million versus $57 million in 2010. The increase is due primarily to an increase in the amortization of net actuarial gains/losses. The amortization is recognized based on the amount of net actuarial gains/losses above certain thresholds and over the period of either the average remaining service lives or average remaining life expectancies of the employees or retirees. OPEB The net periodic benefit cost for postretirement benefits other than pensions (OPEB) was $20 million in 2010 and 2009, and $19 million in 2008. The funded status deficit decreased $38 million during 2010 due primarily to a plan change in the U.S. and benefit payments partially offset by the lower discount rates used in 2010 versus 2009. In 2011, consolidated net periodic benefit costs for the OPEB plans is expected to be approximately $12 million compared to $20 million in 2010. The decrease is primarily due to the favorable impact of a plan amendment within the U.S. plans. See the Critical Accounting Policies section and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of the companys retirement benefits, including a description of the various retirement plans and the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost and funded status. Insurance Praxair purchases insurance to limit a variety of risks, including those related to property, business interruption, third party liability and workers compensation. Currently, the company self retains the first $5 million per occurrence for workers compensation, general and vehicle liability and retains $2.5 million to $5 million per occurrence at its various properties worldwide. To mitigate its aggregate loss potential above varying retentions, the company purchases insurance coverage from highly rated insurance companies at what it believes are reasonable coverage levels. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the company had recorded a total of $28 million and $36 million, respectively, representing an estimate of the retained liability for the ultimate cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet dates. The estimated liability is established using statistical analyses and is based upon historical experience, actuarial assumptions and professional judgment. These estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency and are subject to a significant degree of inherent variability. If actual claims differ from the companys estimates, they will be adjusted at that time and financial results could be impacted. Praxair recognizes estimated insurance proceeds relating to damages at the time of loss only to the extent of incurred losses. Any insurance recoveries for business interruption and for property damages in excess of the net book value of the property are recognized only when realized. 24 Table of Contents SEGMENT DISCUSSION The following summary of sales and operating profit by segment provides a basis for the discussion that follows (for additional information concerning Praxairs segments, see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements). Praxair evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on operating profit, excluding the items not indicative of ongoing business trends. Accordingly, segment operating profit and the following discussion of segment results, including comparisons with prior periods, exclude the impact of: (i) the US homecare divestiture and Venezuela currency devaluation in 2010, (ii) the Brazil tax amnesty program and other charges in 2009, and (iii) the cost reduction program and other charges in 2008.

Sales for 2010 increased $485 million, or 10%, versus 2009. Excluding the impacts of currency and cost pass through, sales increased 7% due largely to higher volumes. Sales to metals and chemical end markets increased significantly from 2009. Sales to manufacturing customers also improved throughout the year as the economy continued to improve. Sales to the energy market, primarily hydrogen for refining, were higher than 2009 due to strong demand and a new plant start up. Currency appreciation in Canada and Mexico increased sales by $108 million, or 2%. Higher cost pass through increased sales by $44 million, or 1%, with a minimal impact on operating profit. 25 Table of Contents Operating profit for 2010 increased $152 million, or 15% versus 2009 driven by higher volumes and productivity gains. Sales for 2009 decreased $1,313 million, or 22%, versus 2008. Excluding the impacts of currency and cost pass through, sales declined 12% due to lower volumes partially offset by higher pricing. Higher sales to the energy markets were offset by lower sales to the chemicals, metals, electronics and manufacturing end markets. Currency depreciation in Canada and Mexico, reduced sales by $201 million, or 3%. Lower cost pass through decreased sales by $443 million, or 7%, with a minimal impact on operating profit. Operating profit for 2009 decreased $34 million, or 3% versus 2008. Excluding the negative impact of currency, operating profit was higher than the prior year despite significantly lower volumes due to cost savings from the cost reduction program and ongoing productivity initiatives.

Excluding unfavorable currency effects, sales increased 9% primarily due to 6% volume growth. Sales grew to the metals, energy and electronics end markets. Cost pass through to customers increased sales by $11 million, or 1%, with a minimal impact on operating profit. Operating profit for 2010 of $267 million was comparable to 2009. Excluding the negative impact currency, underlying operating profit increased due to higher volumes. Sales for 2009 decreased $219 million, or 15% versus 2008. Unfavorable currency reduced sales by 6%. Excluding the impacts of currency and cost pass through, sales declined 9% due primarily to sharply lower volumes in the metals, chemicals and electronics end markets. Cost pass through to customers increased sales by $9 million, or less than 1%, with a minimal impact on operating profit. Operating profit for 2009 decreased $97 million, or 27% versus 2008. Operating profit included net income hedge losses of $2 million in 2009 and a gain of $10 million in 2008 (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements). Excluding the impact of net income hedges in both years, operating profit decreased $85 million, or 24%. The underlying decrease in operating profit was due to lower volumes and negative currency partially offset by cost reductions. 26 Table of Contents South America % Changefrom Prior Year 2010 2009 Sales Volume 8 % (10 )% Price/Mix/Other 3 % 5 % Cost pass through % 1 % Currency 9 % (9 )% Total sales change 20 % (13 )% Praxairs South American industrial gases operations are conducted by its subsidiary, White Martins Gases Industriais Ltda.

Sales in 2010 increased $325 million, or 20% versus 2009. Excluding currency effects, underlying sales grew 11% due to higher sales to metals and manufacturing customers and higher pricing. Operating profit in 2010 increased $104 million, or 30% versus 2009. Operating profit included currency related net losses of $3 million and $13 million, in 2010 and 2009, respectively which primarily pertained to net income hedges (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements). Excluding the impact of currency and net income hedges, underlying operating profit grew 19% as a result of higher volumes and higher pricing. Operating profit for 2010 included a benefit from a decision to settle certain disputes under a special amnesty program recently enacted by the State of Rio de Janeiro, which was largely offset by charges in connection with a non core service business restructuring. Sales for 2009 decreased $244 million, or 13% versus 2008. Excluding the impact of currency and cost pass through, sales decreased 5%. The decrease was primarily due to lower volumes to metals and manufacturing customers, partially offset by higher sales to the food and beverage, healthcare end markets and higher pricing.

Excluding currency and cost pass through effects, and an equipment sale in the prior year, sales increased 21% versus 2009. The underlying increase was driven by strong growth in on site and merchant gas volumes in China, India and Korea due to large plant start ups and higher sales to the electronics, metals and manufacturing end markets. Cost pass through, primarily higher precious metals prices used in electronic materials, increased sales by $55 million, or 6%, with a minimal impact on operating profit. Operating profit for 2010 increased $28 million, or 20% versus the respective 2009 periods, due primarily to higher volumes. Sales for 2009 decreased $6 million, or 1% versus 2008. An equipment sale contributed 3% to sales during 2009. Unfavorable currency decreased sales by 6%. Excluding the impacts of currency, cost pass through and the equipment sale, sales were flat with 2008. The full year 2009 results reflect strong growth in sales volumes in the fourth quarter due to large plant start ups and higher sales to all major end markets. Cost pass through to customers increased sales by $16 million, or 2%, with a minimal impact on operating profit. Operating profit for 2009 decreased $11 million, or 7% versus the respective 2008 periods, primarily as the result of currency depreciation.

Underlying sales increased 3% driven by higher jet engine and industrial coatings volumes. Operating profit increased $3 million, or 4%, versus 2009 periods driven by higher volumes partially offset by the negative impact of currency, a pension settlement charge and restructuring costs. Sales for 2009 decreased $58 million, or 10% versus 2008. The acquisition of Sermatech contributed $44 million in 2009, or 8% of sales. Excluding the impact of negative currency translation and acquisitions, underlying sales decreased 14%. In 2009, growth from higher coatings for jet engines was more than offset by lower coatings for industrial gas turbines and the general manufacturing end markets in the U.S. and Europe. Operating profit for 2009 decreased $15 million, or 16%, for versus 2008 periods. The decrease was principally driven by lower volumes and the negative impact of currency partially offset by productivity and cost reduction initiatives. 28 Table of Contents Currency The results of Praxairs non U.S. operations are translated to the companys reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, from the functional currencies used in the countries in which the company operates. For most foreign operations, Praxair uses the local currency as its functional currency. There is inherent variability and unpredictability in the relationship of these functional currencies to the U.S. dollar and such currency movements may materially impact Praxairs results of operations in any given period. To help understand the reported results, the following is a summary of the significant currencies underlying Praxairs consolidated results and the exchange rates used to translate the financial statements (rates of exchange expressed in units of local currency per U.S. dollar): Currency Percent of2010ConsolidatedSales (a) Statements of Income Balance Sheets Average Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 Brazil real 17 % 1.76 2.00 1.80 1.67 1.74 Euro 15 % 0.75 0.72 0.67 0.76 0.69 Canada dollar 8 % 1.04 1.15 1.04 1.00 1.05 Mexico peso 6 % 12.69 13.61 10.89 12.38 13.03 China yuan 4 % 6.78 6.83 6.96 6.62 6.83 India rupee 2 % 45.95 48.62 42.80 45.10 46.68 Korea won 2 % 1,163 1,287 1,056 1,137 1,170 Singapore dollar 2 % 1.37 1.46 1.41 1.30 1.40 Argentina peso 1 % 3.91 3.73 3.16 3.98 3.80 Colombia peso 1 % 1,897 2,155 1,947 1,914 2,044 Taiwan dollar 1 % 31.69 33.10 31.45 29.42 32.29 Thailand bhat 1 % 31.92 34.44 32.54 30.12 33.36 Venezuela bolivar (b) &lt;1 % 4.30 2.15 2.15 4.30 2.15 a) Certain Surface technologies segment sales are included in European, Indian and Brazilian sales. b) Effective January 8, 2010, the Venezuelan government announced a devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar to 4.30 (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). 29 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND OTHER FINANCIAL DATA (Millions of dollars) Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Net Cash Provided by (Used for) Operating Activities Net income Praxair, Inc. plus depreciation and amortization (a) $ 2,120 $ 2,100 $ 2,061 Noncontrolling interests 39 43 45 Net income plus depreciation and amortization (including noncontrolling interests) 2,159 2,143 2,106 Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities: Brazil tax amnesty program and other charges, net of payments (b) 80 234 149 Working capital 16 (58 ) 63 Spanish income tax settlement (a) (b) (231 ) Pension contributions (124 ) (128 ) (20 ) Other net 5 (23 ) (260 ) Total provided by operating activities $ 1,905 $ 2,168 $ 2,038 Investing Activities Capital expenditures $ (1,388 ) $ (1,352 ) $ (1,611 ) Acquisitions, net of cash acquired (148 ) (131 ) (130 ) Divestitures and asset sales 52 31 54 Total used for investing $ (1,484 ) $ (1,452 ) $ (1,687 ) Financing Activities Debt increases (reductions) net $ 490 $ (62 ) $ 987 Issuances (purchases) of common stock net (404 ) (141 ) (892 ) Cash dividends Praxair, Inc. shareholders (551 ) (491 ) (468 ) Excess tax benefit on stock option exercises 51 23 54 Noncontrolling interest transactions and other (5 ) (40 ) (14 ) Total used for financing $ (419 ) $ (711 ) $ (333 ) Other Financial Data (c) Debt to capital ratio 47.5 % 47.2 % 53.8 % After tax return on capital 14.4 % 13.8 % 15.3 % (a) The total payments related to the Spanish income tax settlement in the fourth quarter 2010 were $481 million and are shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows as follows: Net income Praxair, Inc. plus depreciation and amortization $ (250 ) Spanish income tax settlement payment of previously recorded expense (231 ) Net operating cash flow impact $ (481 ) (b) See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

Capital expenditures were $1,388 million. Acquisition expenditures were $148 million, related primarily to the acquisition of an ownership interest in industrial gas businesses in the Middle East. The company paid $551 million of dividends and repurchased $404 million of stock, net of issuances. In addition, debt increased by approximately $500 million. Cash Flows From Operations * Includes Spanish income tax settlement payment of $481 million. 2010 compared with 2009 Cash flow from operations decreased $263 million to $1,905 million from $2,168 million in 2009. The decrease was due primarily to the Spanish income tax settlement payment partially offset by higher net income Praxair, Inc., and benefits from working capital changes. 2009 compared with 2008 Cash flow from operations increased $130 million to $2,168 million from $2,038 million in 2008. The increase was primarily due to higher net income Praxair, Inc., adjusted for the non cash portion of the Brazil tax amnesty program and other charges, and lower tax payments in 2009 partially offset by increased pension contributions and working capital changes. Investing 31 Table of Contents 2010 compared with 2009 Net cash used for investing activities of $1,484 million in 2010 increased $32 million versus 2009 primarily due to increased capital expenditures and acquisitions. Capital expenditures in 2010 were $1,388 million, an increase of $36 million from 2009. Capital expenditures during 2010 related largely to new production plants under contract for customers in North and South America, China and India. Acquisition expenditures in 2010 were $148 million, an increase of $17 million from 2009. 2010 included the acquisition of 49% ownership interest in the ROC groups Kuwait and Qatar operations. An additional cash outlay of $70 million is anticipated during the first half of 2011 to complete the transaction. 2009 included the acquisition of Sermatech, a global supplier of protective coatings and advanced processes with operations in the U.S., Canada, United Kingdom, Germany and South Korea, and several small acquisitions, primarily related to North American packaged gas distributors (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). Divestitures and asset sales in 2010 totaled $52 million, an increase of $21 million from 2009. 2009 compared with 2008 Net cash used for investing activities of $1,452 million in 2009 decreased $235 million versus 2008 primarily due to decreased capital expenditures partially offset by the impact of lower divestitures and asset sales. Capital expenditures in 2009 were $1,352 million, a decrease of $259 million from 2008. Capital expenditures during 2009 related largely to new production plants under contract for customers in North and South America, China and India. Acquisition expenditures in 2009 were $131 million, which were about flat with 2008. 2009 included the acquisition of Sermatech, a global supplier of protective coatings and advanced processes with operations in the U.S., Canada, United Kingdom, Germany and South Korea, and several small acquisitions, primarily related to North American packaged gas distributors. 2008 included the acquisition of Kirk Welding Supply Inc., an independent packaged gas distributor in the United States, and several small acquisitions in North America, Europe and South America (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). Divestitures and asset sales in 2009 totaled $31 million, a decrease of $23 million from 2008. Financing 32 Table of Contents Praxairs financing strategy is to secure long term committed funding at attractive interest rates by issuing U.S. public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by long term bank credit agreements. Praxairs international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and inter company funding to minimize the total cost of funds and to manage and centralize currency exchange exposures. As deemed necessary, Praxair manages its exposure to interest rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk). The company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2010, the companys credit ratings as reported by Standard & Poors and Moodys were A 1 and P 1 for short term debt, respectively, and A and A 2 for long term debt, respectively. Additionally, the company plans to maintain its undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries to support foreign growth opportunities and reduce local debt. On January 4, 2010, Praxair entered into an interest rate swap agreement related to the $400 million 1.75% Notes due 2012 which effectively converted fixed rate interest to floating rate interest. In October 2010, Praxair settled this interest rate swap agreement and received a cash payment of $16 million. On January 14, 2010, Praxair issued $500 million of 2.125% Notes due 2013 and concurrently entered into an interest rate swap agreement which effectively converted fixed rate interest to floating rate interest. In addition, during 2010, Praxair also borrowed $368 million under its $400 million revolving multi currency credit facility in Europe. The proceeds of these borrowings were used to repay short term debt and for general corporate purposes. Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the companys debt refinancing in 2010, current debt position and available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments. Such credit facilities are with major financial institutions and are non cancellable until maturity. Therefore, the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Praxairs major bank credit and long term debt agreements contain standard financial covenants which the company is in compliance with at December 31, 2010 and expects to remain in compliance with for the foreseeable future. The company intends to secure a new credit facility to replace the $1,000 million Senior Unsecured credit facility that is set to expire in December 2011. Cash used for financing activities was $419 million in 2010 compared to $711 million in 2009. This decrease was primarily due to higher net debt issuances in 2010 partially offset by higher stock repurchases net of issuances. Cash dividends of $551 million increased $60 million from the year ago period. On July 28, 2010, the company announced that the companys board of directors approved a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program authorizing the company to repurchase shares from time to time on the open market or through negotiated transactions, subject to market and business conditions. As of December 31, 2010, $456 million of stock repurchases had been completed under the program, leaving an additional $1,044 million remaining authorized for purchase. The Company completed the purchase of its common stock pursuant to the previously approved $1 billion 2008 share repurchase program during the third quarter of 2010. Year to date repurchases under the 2008 share repurchase program were $142 million. At December 31, 2010, Praxairs total debt outstanding was $5,557 million, $502 million higher than $5,055 million at December 31, 2009. The proceeds from debt issuances and credit facility borrowings during 2010 were used primarily to repay short term debt obligations and for general corporate purposes. The December 31, 2010 debt balance includes $4,923 million in public securities and $634 million representing primarily worldwide bank borrowings. Praxairs global effective borrowing rate was approximately 3.6% for 2010. 33 Table of Contents Other Financial Data Praxairs debt to capital ratio was 47.5% at December 31, 2010 versus 47.2% at December 31, 2009. The slight increase is attributed to higher debt levels offset by an increase in shareholders equity. After tax return on capital increased to 14.4% at December 31, 2010 versus 2009 due primarily to the increase in net operating profit after tax partially offset by an increase in average capital year over year. See the Non GAAP Financial Measures section for definitions and reconciliation of these non GAAP measures to reported amounts. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth Praxairs material contract obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2010: (Millions of dollars) Due or expiring by December 31, 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Long term debt obligations: Debt and capitalized lease maturities $ 32 $ 1,302 $ 899 $ 701 $ 923 $ 1,330 $ 5,187 Contractual interest 197 170 143 124 81 137 852 Operating leases 94 76 62 53 42 48 375 Retirement obligations 154 34 35 35 35 163 456 Unconditional purchase obligations 515 340 250 240 181 1,425 2,951 Construction commitments 673 244 21 938 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,665 $ 2,166 $ 1,410 $ 1,153 $ 1,262 $ 3,103 $ 10,759 Long term debt and capitalized lease maturities of $ 5,187 million are more fully described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements and are included on the companys balance sheet as long term liabilities and current portion of long term debt. Contractual interest on long term debt of $852 million represents interest the company is contracted to pay on outstanding long term debt, current portion of long term debt and capital lease obligations, calculated on a basis consistent with planned debt maturities, excluding the interest impact of interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2010, Praxair had fixed rate debt of $3,834 million and floating rate debt of $1,723 million. The rate assumed for floating rate debt was the rate in effect at December 31, 2010. Obligations under operating leases of $375 million represent non cancelable contractual obligations primarily for manufacturing and distribution equipment and office space. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further details. Retirement obligations of $456 million include estimates of pension plan contributions and expected future benefit payments for unfunded pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions (OPEB). Pension plan contributions are forecast through 2011 only. For purposes of the table, $120 million of contributions have been included for 2011 based on the range of $70 million to $120 million. Expected future unfunded pension and OPEB benefit payments are forecast through 2020. Contribution and unfunded benefit payment estimates are based upon current valuation assumptions. Estimates of pension contributions after 2011 and unfunded benefit payments after 2020 are not included in the table because the timing of their resolution cannot be estimated. Retirement obligations are more fully described in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Unconditional purchase obligations of $2,951 million represent contractual commitments under various long and short term take or pay arrangements with suppliers. These obligations are primarily minimum purchase 34 Table of Contents commitments for helium, electricity, natural gas and feedstock used to produce atmospheric and process gases. During 2010, payments under these contracts totaled $1,016 million, including $526 million for electricity and $225 million for natural gas. A significant portion of these obligations is passed on to customers through similar take or pay contractual arrangements. Purchase obligations that are not passed along to customers do not represent a significant risk to Praxair. Construction commitments of $938 million represent outstanding commitments to complete authorized construction projects as of December 31, 2010. A significant portion of Praxairs capital spending is related to the construction of new production facilities to satisfy customer commitments which may take a year or more to complete. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions totaling $77 million, including interest and penalties, are not included in the table because the timing of their resolution cannot be estimated. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures surrounding uncertain income tax positions. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, at December 31, 2010, Praxair had entered into various guarantees and other arrangements, and had undrawn outstanding letters of credit from financial institutions. These arrangements were entered into in connection with normal business operations and they are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on Praxairs consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding Praxairs financial statements and accompanying notes prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). Their application places significant importance on managements judgment as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Praxairs financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected if actual results differ from estimates made. These policies are determined by management and have been reviewed by Praxairs Audit Committee. Depreciable Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment Praxairs net property, plant and equipment at December 31, 2010 was $9,532 million, representing 62% of the companys consolidated total assets. Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $904 million, or 11% of total operating costs. Management judgment is required in the determination of the estimated depreciable lives that are used to calculate the annual depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation. Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over the assets estimated useful lives on a straight line basis for financial reporting purposes. The estimated useful life represents the projected period of time that the asset will be productively employed by the company and is determined by management based on many factors, including historical experience with similar assets, technological life cycles, geographic locations and contractual supply relationships with on site customers. Circumstances and events relating to these assets, such as on site contract modifications, are monitored to ensure that changes in asset lives or impairments (see Asset Impairments) are identified and prospective depreciation expense or impairment expense is adjusted accordingly. Praxairs largest asset values relate to cryogenic air separation production plants with depreciable lives of principally 15 years. Based upon the assets as of December 31, 2010, if depreciable lives of machinery and equipment, on average, were increased or decreased by one year, annual depreciation expense would be decreased by approximately $42 million or increased by approximately $47 million, respectively. 35 Table of Contents Pension Benefits Pension benefits represent financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements. Because of the uncertainties involved in estimating the timing and amount of future payments, significant estimates are required to calculate pension expense and liabilities related to the companys plans. The company utilizes the services of several independent actuaries, whose models are used to facilitate these calculations. Several key assumptions are used in actuarial models to calculate pension expense and liability amounts recorded in the financial statements. Management believes the three most significant variables in the models are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate, and the expected rate of compensation increase. The actuarial models also use assumptions for various other factors, including employee turnover, retirement age, and mortality. Praxair management believes the assumptions used in the actuarial calculations are reasonable, reflect the companys experience and expectations for the future and are within accepted practices in each of the respective geographic locations in which it operates. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors. The weighted average expected long term rates of return on pension plan assets were 8.25% for U.S. plans and 8.60% for international plans for the year ended December 31, 2010 (8.25% and 9.10%, respectively, at December 31, 2009). These rates are determined annually by management based on a weighted average of current and historical market trends, historical and expected portfolio performance and the current and expected portfolio mix of investments. A 0.50% change in these expected long term rates of return, with all other variables held constant, would change Praxairs pension expense by approximately $8 million. The company has consistently used a market related value of assets rather than the fair value at the measurement date to determine annual pension expense. The market related value recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets from year to year are not immediately reflected in the companys annual pension expense. Instead, annual pension expense in future periods will be impacted as deferred investment gains or losses are recognized in the market related value of assets over the five year period. The consolidated market related value of assets was $1,779 million, or $128 million higher than the fair value of assets of $1,651 million at December 31, 2010. These net deferred investment losses of $128 million will be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets ratably over the next four years and will impact future pension expense. Future actual investment gains or losses will impact the market related value of assets and, therefore, will impact future annual pension expense in a similar manner. The weighted average discount rates for pension plan liabilities were 5.40% for U.S. plans and 7.40% for international plans at December 31, 2010 (5.90% and 7.70%, respectively, at December 31, 2009). These rates are used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities and are determined annually by management. The discount rate for the U.S. plan is established utilizing a bond matching model provided by the companys independent actuaries. The portfolio of bonds includes only corporate bonds graded AA by Moodys or Standard & Poors and matches the U.S. plans projected cash flows to the spot rates and calculates the single equivalent discount rate which produces the same present value. The discount rates for the remaining international plans are based on market yields for high quality fixed income investments representing the approximate duration of the pension liabilities on the measurement date. A 0.50% increase/decrease in discount rates, with all other variables held constant, would decrease/increase Praxairs pension expense by approximately $13 million and would impact the projected benefit obligation (PBO) by approximately $132 million. The weighted average expected rate of compensation increase was 3.25% for U.S. plans and 3.90% for international plans at December 31, 2010 (3.50% and 3.90%, respectively, at December 31, 2009). The estimated annual compensation increase is determined by management every year and is based on historical trends and market indices. A 0.50% change in the expected rate of compensation increase, with all other variables held constant, would change Praxairs pension expense by approximately $6 million and would impact the PBO by approximately $19 million. 36 Table of Contents Asset Impairments Goodwill At December 31, 2010, the company had goodwill of $ 2,066 million, which represents the aggregate of the excess purchase price for acquired businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The company performs a goodwill impairment test annually in the second quarter or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, and no impairments were indicated. The company has continuously re evaluated the likelihood of goodwill impairments in its reporting units subsequent to the second quarter test, and does not believe there is indication of impairment for any of its reporting units. At December 31, 2010, Praxairs enterprise value was approximately $35 billion (outstanding shares multiplied by the year end stock price plus debt, and without any control premium) while its total capital was $12 billion. The impairment test requires that the company estimate and compare the fair value of its reporting units to their carrying value, including goodwill. Reporting units are determined based on one level below the operating segment level. Fair value is determined through the use of projected future cash flows, multiples of earnings and sales and other factors. Such analysis requires the use of certain future market assumptions and discount factors, which are subjective in nature. Estimated values can be affected by many factors beyond the companys control such as business and economic trends, government regulation, and technological changes. Management believes that the assumptions used to determine fair value are appropriate and reasonable. Although current calculations indicate that no reporting units are at risk of goodwill impairment, changes in circumstances or conditions affecting these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value determination, which could then result in a material impairment charge to the companys results of operations. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures concerning the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an individual asset or asset group may not be recoverable. To assess recoverability, the company compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from the asset or asset group to the carrying amount of the asset or asset group. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment charge reducing the carrying amount to fair value is required. Fair value is determined based on the most appropriate valuation technique, including discounted cash flows. This analysis requires management to make various subjective estimates and assumptions, including the amount of projected future cash flows related to the asset or asset group, the useful life over which cash flows will occur and the assets residual value, if any. Income Taxes At December 31, 2010, Praxair had deferred tax assets of $838 million (net of valuation allowances of $111 million), and deferred tax liabilities of $1,378 million. At December 31, 2010, uncertain tax positions totaled $153 million (see Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements). Income tax expense was $768 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. In the preparation of consolidated financial statements, Praxair estimates income taxes based on diverse legislative and regulatory structures that exist in various jurisdictions where the company conducts business. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent tax benefits or obligations that arise from temporary differences due to differing treatment of certain items for accounting and income tax purposes. Praxair evaluates 37 Table of Contents deferred tax assets each period to ensure that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character (e.g. capital gain versus ordinary income treatment), amount and timing to result in their recovery. A valuation allowance is established when management determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized to reduce the assets to their realizable value. Considerable judgments are required in establishing deferred tax valuation allowances and in assessing exposures related to tax matters. As events and circumstances change, related reserves and valuation allowances are adjusted to income at that time. Praxairs tax returns are subject to audit and local taxing authorities could challenge the companys tax positions. The companys practice is to review tax filing positions by jurisdiction and to record provisions for uncertain income tax positions, including interest and penalties when applicable. Praxair believes it records and or discloses such potential tax liabilities as appropriate and has reasonably estimated its income tax liabilities and recoverable tax assets. If new information becomes available, adjustments are charged against income at that time. Management does not anticipate that such adjustments would have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on the companys reported results of operations. Contingencies The company accrues liabilities for non income tax contingencies when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, while contingent gains are recognized only when realized. If new information becomes available or losses are sustained in excess of recorded amounts, adjustments are charged against income at that time. Management does not anticipate that in the aggregate such losses would have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on the companys reported results of operations. Praxair is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. These actions are based upon alleged environmental, tax, antitrust and personal injury claims, among others (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements). Such contingencies are significant and the accounting requires considerable management judgments in analyzing each matter to assess the likely outcome and the need for establishing appropriate liabilities and providing adequate disclosures. Praxair believes it records and or discloses such potential contingencies as appropriate and has reasonably estimated its liabilities. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning new accounting standards and the impact of the implementation of these standards on the companys financial statements. Fair Value Measurements Praxair does not expect changes in the aggregate fair value of its financial assets and liabilities to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.

Please consider the companys forward looking statements in light of those risks. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Praxair is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The objective of financial risk management at Praxair is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the companys earnings, cash flows and equity. To manage these risks, Praxair uses various derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, currency swaps, forward contracts, currency options and commodity contracts. Praxair only uses commonly traded and non leveraged instruments. These contracts are entered into primarily with major banking institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. Also, see Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of Praxairs accounting policies and use of such instruments. The following discussion presents the sensitivity of the market value, earnings and cash flows of Praxairs financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest and exchange rates assuming these changes occurred at December 31, 2010. The range of changes chosen for these discussions reflects Praxairs view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period. Market values represent the present values of projected future cash flows based on interest rate and exchange rate assumptions. Interest Rate and Debt Sensitivity Analysis At December 31, 2010, Praxair had debt totaling $5,557 million ($5,055 million at December 31, 2009). At December 31, 2010, there were two interest rate swap agreements outstanding with notional amounts totaling $900 million that convert fixed rate interest to variable rate interest on the $500 million 2.125% notes due 2013 and the $400 million 3.25% notes that mature in 2015. At December 31, 2009, there was one interest rate swap agreement outstanding that converts fixed rate interest to variable rate interest on the $400 million 3.25% notes that mature in 2015. When considered necessary, interest rate swaps are entered into as hedges of underlying financial instruments to effectively change the characteristics of the interest rate without actually changing the underlying financial instrument. For fixed rate instruments, interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for floating rate instruments, interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but impact future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. At December 31, 2010, Praxair had fixed rate debt of $3,834 million and floating rate debt of $1,723 million, representing 69% and 31%, respectively, of total debt. At December 31, 2009, Praxair had fixed rate debt of $3,793 million and floating rate debt of $1,262 million, representing 75% and 25%, respectively, of total debt. Holding other variables constant (such as foreign exchange rates, swaps and debt levels), a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would increase the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately $191 million ($209 million in 2009). At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the after tax earnings and cash flows impact for the subsequent year resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates would be approximately $12 million and $9 million, respectively, holding other variables constant. Exchange Rate Sensitivity Analysis Praxairs exchange rate exposures result primarily from its investments and ongoing operations in South America (primarily Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Venezuela), Europe (primarily Italy, Spain and Germany), Canada, Mexico, Asia (primarily China, India, Korea and Thailand) and other business transactions such as the procurement of equipment from foreign sources. Among other techniques, Praxair utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts and options to hedge these exposures. At December 31, 2010, Praxair had $1,148 million notional amount ($1,289 million at December 31, 2009) of foreign exchange contracts of which $1,011 million ($1,161 million in 2009) were to hedge recorded balance sheet exposures and $137 million ($128 million in 2009) were to hedge anticipated future net income. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Holding other variables constant, if there were a 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates for the portfolio, the fair market value of foreign currency contracts outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009 would decrease by approximately $3 million and $9 million, respectively, which would be largely offset by an offsetting gain or loss on the foreign currency fluctuation of the underlying exposure being hedged. 43 Table of Contents
