ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2002 Financial and Operating Performance The year ended December 31, 2002 was highlighted by favorable commodity prices and continued strengthening of North American gas fundamentals; the issuance of 11.5 million shares of common stock to fund strategic acquisitions in the Companys core areas of the West Panhandle gas field and the Gulf of Mexico Falcon field development project; initial production from the Canyon Express gas project; continued development of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico Devils Tower and Falcon fields and the Sable oil field offshore South Africa; indications that the Argentine economy and currency may be stabilizing; continued evaluation of the Gabon discovery; an oil discovery in Tunisia; the acquisition of undeveloped property interests in Alaska; the completion of a public offering of $150 million of 7 1/2 percent senior notes that will mature in 2012; and repurchases of $61.0 million of higher yielding funded debt to reduce the Companys future costs of capital. During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company recorded net income of $26.7 million, $100.0 million and $152.2 million ($.23, $1.00 and $1.53 per diluted share), respectively. Compared to 2001, the Companys 2002 total revenues and other income decreased by $159.0 million, or 18 percent, including a $145.2 million decrease in oil and gas revenues. The decrease in oil and gas revenues was due to decreases of five percent, 19 percent and 23 percent in average oil, NGL and gas prices, respectively, including the effects of commodity price hedges. Compared to 2001, the Companys 2002 total costs and expenses decreased by $105.4 million, or 14 percent. The decrease in total costs and expenses was primarily reflective of a $42.0 million decrease in exploration and abandonments expense, primarily due to the allocation of a larger percentage of the Companys 2002 capital budget to the development of the Companys Canyon Express, Falcon, Devils Tower and Sable projects; a $36.1 million decrease in interest expense, primarily due to declining underlying market interest rates, interest savings associated with the replacement of higher yielding senior notes and capital cost obligations with lower yielding senior notes and corporate credit facility indebtedness, interest rate hedge gains and increased interest capitalized on significant capital projects; and a $22.3 million decrease in other expense, primarily due to declines in derivative mark to market provisions, gas marketing losses and bad debt expense. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Companys net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $332.2 million, as compared to $475.6 million during 2001 and $430.1 million during 2000. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during 2002 was primarily due to declines in oil, NGL and gas prices as discussed above. During 2002, successful capital investment activities increased the Companys proved reserves to 736.7 MMBOE, reflecting the effects of strategic acquisitions of properties in the Companys core operating areas and a successful drilling program which resulted in the replacement of 258 percent of production at an acquisition and finding cost per BOE of $6.30. During the three years ended December 31, 2002, Pioneer has replaced 210 percent of production at an acquisition and finding cost per BOE of $6.24. Costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2002 totaled $672.5 million, including $195.5 million of proved and unproved property acquisitions and $477.0 million of exploration and development drilling and seismic expenditures. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company purchased, through two transactions, an additional 30 percent working interest in the Falcon field development and a 25 percent working interest in associated acreage in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for a combined purchase price of $61.1 million. As a result of these transactions, the Company owns a 75 percent working interest in and operates the Falcon field development and related exploration blocks. Also during 2002, the Company completed the purchase of the remaining 23 percent of the rights that the Company did not already own in its core area West Panhandle gas field, 100 percent of the West Panhandle reserves attributable to field fuel, 100 percent of the related West Panhandle field gathering system and ten blocks surrounding the Companys deepwater Gulf of Mexico Falcon discovery. In connection with these transactions, the Company recorded $100.4 million to proved oil and gas properties, $3.8 million to unproved oil and gas properties and $1.9 million to assets held for resale; retired a capital cost obligation for $60.8 million; settled a $20.9 million gas balancing receivable; assumed trade and environmental obligations amounting to $5.8 million in the aggregate; and paid $140.2 million of cash. 24 See "Results of Operations" and "Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity", below, for more in depth discussions of the Companys oil and gas producing activities, including discussions pertaining to oil and gas production volumes, prices, hedging activities, costs and expenses, capital commitments, capital resources and liquidity. 2003 Outlook Commodity prices. During 2001, commodity prices declined from historically high levels at the beginning of the year to historically moderate levels by year end. World oil prices increased during 2002 in response to political unrest and supply disruptions in the Middle East and Venezuela. During the third and fourth quarters of 2002, North American gas prices improved as market fundamentals strengthened. The Companys outlook for 2003 commodity prices is uncertain. Significant factors that will impact 2003 commodity prices include the final resolution of issues currently impacting Iraq and Venezuela, the extent to which members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil exporting nations are able to manage oil supply through export quotas and overall North American gas supply and demand fundamentals. Pioneer will continue to moderate its debt levels, follow cost management measures and strategically hedge oil and gas price risk to mitigate the impact of price volatility on its oil, NGL and gas revenues. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had hedged 22,236 barrels per day ("Bblpd") of 2003 oil production under swap contracts with a weighted average fixed price to be received of $24.45 per Bbl. The Company had also hedged 230,000 Mcf per day of 2003 gas production under swap contracts with a weighted average fixed price to be received of $3.76 per MMBtu. During January 2003, the Company increased its 2003 commodity hedge positions by entering into 6,000 Bblpd of March oil swap contracts with average per Bbl fixed prices of $33.51. Additionally, at December 31, 2002 the Company has deferred oil hedge losses of $.5 million that will be recognized as reductions to oil revenue during the last eight months of 2003 and $72.5 million of gas hedge gains that will be recognized as increases to gas revenue during 2003. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys open hedge positions at December 31, 2002. Also see "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for disclosures about the Companys commodity related derivative financial instruments. First quarter 2003. Based on current estimates, the Company expects that its first quarter worldwide production will average 120 to 128 MBOE per day. Included in the mid point of the estimate is 95 MMcf per day, net to the Company from Canyon Express. First quarter production costs are expected to average $5.10 to $5.40 per BOE based on recent NYMEX strip prices for oil and gas. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense is expected to average $5.75 to $6.00 per BOE, and total exploration and abandonment expense is expected to be $20 million to $50 million. General and administrative expense is expected to be $16 million to $17 million during the first quarter of 2003, $2 million to $3 million of which relates to estimated additional performance based compensation costs. Interest expense is expected to be $24 million to $26 million. Interest capitalized during the first quarter of 2003 will be significantly less than interest capitalized during the first three quarters of 2002 as the Companys largest capital project for which interest was being capitalized, the Canyon Express development project, was put into production during September 2002. Additionally, during February 2003, the Company entered into interest rate swap contracts to hedge a portion of the fair value of its 9 5/8 percent senior notes. Under the terms of the interest rate swap contracts, the Company will receive a fixed annual rate of 9 5/8 percent on $250 million notional amount and will pay the counterparties a variable rate on the notional amount equal to the six month LIBOR, reset semi annually, plus a weighted average margin of 566.4 basis points. Income taxes, principally in Argentina, are expected to be approximately $2 million as the Company benefits from the carryforward of net operating losses in the United States and Canada. Production growth. The Company expects that its annual 2003 worldwide production will be approximately 165 MBOE per day, an increase of 45 percent over 2002 levels. The growth in production during 2003 includes initial production during the second quarter from the Companys deepwater Gulf of Mexico Falcon gas project and the Sable oil project in South Africa, coupled with peak rates of production from Canyon Express and increases in production from the Companys core properties in the United States, Argentina and Canada due to an aggressive development drilling program with approximately twice as many wells anticipated in 2003 versus 2002. Capital expenditures. During 2003, the Companys budget for oil and gas producing activities is expected to range from $450 million to $550 million, of which approximately 35 percent has been budgeted for exploration expenditures and 65 percent has been budgeted for development drilling and facility costs. The Companys 2003 capital budget is allocated approximately 60 percent to the 25 United States, nine percent to Argentina and Canada and 22 percent to Africa. The Companys 2003 capital budget includes $35 million of remaining development capital to complete the Falcon and Devils Tower development projects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the Sable oil project offshore South Africa. Aggressive development drilling programs in the Companys core Spraberry oil field, Hugoton and West Panhandle gas fields, the United States Gulf Coast, Argentina and Canada will resume with approximately twice as many wells anticipated in 2003 versus 2002. During 2003, the Company has planned exploration drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, the onshore Gulf Coast area, Alaska, Canada, Gabon, Tunisia and South Africa. During the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, the Company expects to expend approximately $172 million and $151 million, respectively, of capital for development drilling and facility costs related to its proved undeveloped reserves. Critical Accounting Estimates The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements for inclusion in this Report in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). See Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a comprehensive discussion of the Companys significant accounting policies. GAAP represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements, the application of which requires management judgements and estimates including, in certain circumstances, choices between acceptable GAAP alternatives. Following is a discussion of the Companys most critical accounting estimates, judgements and uncertainties that are inherent in the Companys application of GAAP: Accounting for oil and gas producing activities. The accounting for and disclosure of oil and gas producing activities requires the Companys management to choose between GAAP alternatives and to make judgements about estimates of future uncertainties. Successful efforts method of accounting. The Company utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities as opposed to the alternate acceptable full cost method. In general, the Company believes that, during periods of active exploration, net assets and net income are more conservatively measured under the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities than under the full cost method. The critical difference between the successful efforts method of accounting and the full cost method is as follows: under the successful efforts method, exploratory dry holes and geological and geophysical exploration costs are charged against earnings during the periods in which they occur; whereas, under the full cost method of accounting, such costs and expenses are capitalized as assets, pooled with the costs of successful wells and charged against the earnings of future periods as a component of depletion expense. During 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company recognized exploration, abandonment, geological and geophysical expense of $85.9 million, $127.9 million and $87.6 million, respectively, under the successful efforts method. Proved reserve estimates. Estimates of the Companys proved reserves included in this Report are prepared in accordance with GAAP and SEC guidelines. The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of: o the quality and quantity of available data; o the interpretation of that data; o the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and o the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate. The Companys proved reserve information included in this Report as of December 31, 2002 was based on evaluations audited by independent petroleum engineers with respect to the Companys major properties and prepared by the Companys engineers with respect to all other properties. The Companys proved reserve information included in this Report as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 was based on evaluations prepared by the Companys engineers. Estimates prepared by other third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein. Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, all of which may substantially differ from future actual results, reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate. The Companys stockholders should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of the Companys estimated 26 proved reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the Company based the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. The Companys estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion expense. If the estimates of proved reserves decline, the rate at which the Company records depletion expense will increase, reducing future net income. Such a decline may result from lower market prices, which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields. In addition, the decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of the Companys assessment of its oil and gas producing properties for impairment. Impairment of proved oil and gas properties. The Company reviews its long lived proved properties to be held and used whenever management judges that events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable. Management assesses whether or not an impairment provision is necessary based upon managements outlook of future commodity prices and net cash flows that may be generated by the properties. Proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment by depletable pool, which is the lowest level at which depletion of proved properties is calculated. Impairment of unproved oil and gas properties. Management periodically assesses individually significant unproved oil and gas properties for impairment, on a project by project basis. Managements assessment of the results of exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects impact the amount and timing of impairment provisions. Assessments of functional currencies. Management determines the functional currencies of the Companys subsidiaries based on an assessment of the currency of the economic environment in which a subsidiary primarily realizes and expends its operating revenues, costs and expenses. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of all of the Companys international operations except Canada. The assessment of functional currencies can have a significant impact on periodic results of operations and financial position. Argentine economic and currency measures. The accounting for and remeasurement of the Companys Argentine balance sheets as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 reflect managements assumptions regarding some uncertainties unique to Argentinas current economic situation. See Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a description of the assumptions utilized in the preparation of these financial statements. The Argentine economic and political situation continues to evolve and the Argentine government may enact future regulations or policies that, when finalized and adopted, may materially impact, among other items, (i) the realized prices the Company receives for the commodities it produces and sells; (ii) the timing of repatriations of excess cash flow to the Companys corporate headquarters in the United States; (iii) the Companys asset valuations; and (iv) peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Deferred tax asset valuations. Management periodically assesses the probability of recovery of recorded deferred tax assets based on its assessment of future earnings outlooks by tax jurisdiction. Such estimates are inherently imprecise. Many assumptions are utilized in the assessments that may prove to be materially incorrect in the future. New Accounting Pronouncements During June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143"). SFAS 143 amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 19, "Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies" ("SFAS 19") to require that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Under the provisions of SFAS 143, asset retirement obligations are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the long lived asset. Under the provisions of SFAS 19, asset retirement obligations are recognized using a cost accumulation approach. The Company currently records significant asset retirement obligations through the unit of production method, except for such liabilities that were assumed in business combinations, which were recorded at their estimated fair values. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 143 on January 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 143 resulted in a January 1, 2003 cumulative effect adjustment to record (i) a $13.8 million increase in the carrying values of 27 proved properties, (ii) a $26.3 million decrease in accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization of property, plant and equipment, (iii) a $1.0 million increase in current abandonment liabilities and (iv) a $22.4 million increase in noncurrent abandonment liabilities. The net impact of items (i) through (iv) was to record a gain of $16.7 million, net of tax, as a cumulative effect adjustment of a change in accounting principle in the Companys consolidated statements of operations upon adoption on January 1, 2003. During April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections" ("SFAS 145"). Prior to the adoption of the provisions of SFAS 145, gains or losses on the early extinguishment of debt were required to be classified in a companys periodic consolidated statements of operations as extraordinary gains or losses, net of associated income taxes, after the determination of income or loss from continuing operations. SFAS 145 requires, except in the case of events or transactions of a highly unusual and infrequent nature, gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt to be classified as components of a companys income or loss from continuing operations. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 145 on January 1, 2003. The adoption of the provisions of SFAS 145 is not expected to affect the Companys future financial position or liquidity. Upon adoption of the provisions of SFAS 145, gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt recognized in the Companys consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 will be reclassified to other revenues or other expense and included in the determination of the income (loss) from continuing operations of those periods. Results of Operations Oil and gas revenues. Revenues from oil and gas operations totaled $701.8 million during 2002, as compared to $847.0 million during 2001 and $852.7 million during 2000, representing a 17 percent decrease from 2001 to 2002. The revenue decrease from 2001 to 2002 was due to year on year worldwide average gas, NGL and oil price declines of 23 percent, 19 percent and five percent, respectively, including the effects of gas and oil price hedges; and an eight percent decline in worldwide oil production, offset by worldwide NGL and gas production increases of four percent and two percent, respectively. The revenue decrease from 2000 to 2001 was due to a four percent decline in BOE production and a 15 percent decline in NGL price, partially offset by a 15 percent increase in gas price, including the effects of gas hedges. The declines in 2001 sales volumes were primarily attributable to normal well production declines. 28 The following table provides production and price data relevant to the analysis of the Companys revenues from oil and gas operations: Year ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Production: Oil (MBbls)................................... 11,514 12,498 12,535 NGLs (MBbls).................................. 8,086 7,800 8,379 Gas (MMcf).................................... 131,015 127,865 135,843 Total (MBOE).................................. 41,436 41,609 43,555 Average daily production: Oil (Bbls).................................... 31,545 34,241 34,249 NGLs (Bbls)................................... 22,154 21,370 22,894 Gas (Mcf)..................................... 358,945 350,314 371,157 Total (BOE)................................... 113,524 113,997 119,002 Average reported prices: Oil (per Bbl) United States............................... $ 23.66 $ 24.34 $ 22.07 Argentina................................... $ 20.63 $ 23.79 $ 29.09 Canada...................................... $ 22.26 $ 21.87 $ 27.50 Worldwide................................... $ 22.89 $ 24.12 $ 24.01 NGL (per Bbl) United States............................... $ 13.77 $ 16.88 $ 20.05 Argentina................................... $ 14.56 $ 19.29 $ 22.91 Canada...................................... $ 16.77 $ 21.11 $ 24.32 Worldwide................................... $ 13.92 $ 17.14 $ 20.27 Gas (per Mcf) United States............................... $ 3.16 $ 4.10 $ 3.50 Argentina................................... $ .48 $ 1.31 $ 1.19 Canada...................................... $ 2.50 $ 2.86 $ 2.88 Worldwide................................... $ 2.49 $ 3.23 $ 2.81 Annual percentage increase (decrease) in average worldwide reported prices: Oil......................................... (5) 56 NGL......................................... (19) (15) 74 Gas......................................... (23) 15 48 Hedging activities. The commodity prices that the Company reports are based on the market price received for the commodities adjusted by the results of the Companys hedging activities. The Company utilizes commodity derivative contracts (swaps and collars) in order to (i) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities the Company produces and sells, (ii) support the Companys annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and (iii) reduce commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects. The effective portions of changes in the fair values of the Companys commodity price hedge derivatives are deferred as increases or decreases to stockholders equity until the underlying hedged transaction occurs. Consequently, changes in the effective portions of commodity price hedge derivatives add volatility to the Companys reported stockholders equity until the hedge derivative matures or is terminated. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for information concerning the impact to oil and gas revenues during 2002, 2001 and 2000 from the Companys hedging activities, the Companys open hedge positions at December 31, 2002 and descriptions of the Companys hedge and non hedge commodity derivatives. Also see "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for additional disclosure about the Companys commodity related derivative financial instruments. Interest and other revenue. The Company recorded interest and other income totaling $11.2 million, $21.8 million and $25.8 during 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Companys interest and other income was comprised of revenue that was not directly attributable to oil and gas producing activities or oil and gas property divestitures. See Note L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding interest and other income. 29 Gain (loss) on disposition of assets. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company realized $118.9 million of cash proceeds from asset divestitures and, associated therewith, recorded net gains of $4.4 million. The proceeds derived from asset divestitures during 2002 included $91.3 million from the early termination of hedge derivatives, $20.9 million from the cash settlement of a gas balancing receivable, $4.7 million from the sale of certain gas properties located in Oklahoma and $2.0 million from the sale of other corporate assets. The Company recorded a gain of $2.8 million associated with the sale of the gas properties in Oklahoma and a gain of $1.6 million from the sale of other corporate assets. The proceeds from the early termination of hedge derivatives represent deferred hedge gains and losses that will be recognized as increases or decreases to future interest expenses or future oil and gas revenues. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for information regarding the amortization of deferred hedge gains and losses. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company realized $113.5 million of cash proceeds from asset divestitures and, associated therewith, recorded net gains of $7.7 million. The proceeds derived from asset divestitures during 2001 included $85.4 million from the early termination of hedge derivatives, $12.7 million from the sale of the Companys remaining holdings in the common stock of a non affiliated entity, $12.0 million from the sale of certain oil properties in Canada and $3.4 million from the sale of other corporate assets. The Company recorded a gain of $8.1 million from the sale of the remaining holdings in the common stock of the non affiliated entity, a loss of $1.1 million from the sales of oil and gas properties and a gain of $.7 million from the sale of other corporate assets. During 2000, the Company completed the divestiture of certain assets for proceeds of $102.7 million. Associated therewith, the Company recorded a net gain on disposition of assets of $34.2 million. The 2000 divestitures included the sale of common stock of a non affiliated entity for net proceeds of $59.7 million, from which the Company recognized a gain on disposition of assets of $34.3 million. The Company also sold certain oil and gas producing properties and other assets during 2000 for proceeds of $43.0 million, from which the Company recognized a loss on disposition of assets of $.1 million. The net cash proceeds from asset divestitures during 2002, 2001 and 2000 were used, together with net cash flows provided by operating activities, to fund additions to oil and gas properties and to reduce outstanding indebtedness. See Note M of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding asset divestitures. Production costs. Total production costs per BOE decreased in 2002 by four percent and increased in 2001 by 16 percent. In general, lease operating expenses and workover expenses represent the components of production costs over which the Company has management control, while production taxes, ad valorem taxes and field fuel expenses are directly related to commodity price changes. The decrease in production costs during 2002 was primarily due to decreases in field fuel expense and production taxes as a result of lower North American average gas prices and lower Argentine lease operating expenses resulting from lower Argentine expenses on a U.S. dollar equivalent basis due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso versus the U.S. dollar, partially offset by moderately higher workover expenses, ad valorem taxes (which are computed using prior year average annual commodity prices) and declines in the third party gas processing and treating margin component of lease operating expense. The increase in production costs during 2001 was primarily due to increases in field fuel expense as a result of higher North American average gas prices, higher ad valorem taxes and to declines in the third party gas processing and treating margin component of lease operating expenses. The following table provides the components of the Companys production costs during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000: Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (per BOE) Lease operating expenses............ $ 2.87 $ 2.76 $ 2.42 Taxes: Production........................ .54 .74 .77 Ad valorem ....................... .54 .49 .29 Field fuel expenses................. .62 .88 .71 Workover expenses................... .25 .17 .15 Total production costs........ $ 4.82 $ 5.04 $ 4.34 30 Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense. The Companys total depletion, depreciation and amortization expense per BOE was $5.22, $5.35 and $4.93 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Depletion expense, the largest component of depletion, depreciation and amortization, was $5.01, $5.02 and $4.57 per BOE during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and depreciation and amortization of other property and equipment was $.21, $.33 and $.36 per BOE during each of the respective years. The decrease in depreciation and amortization of other property and equipment during 2002 was primarily comprised of decreases associated with fully amortized information technology assets. During 2001, the increase in per BOE depletion expense was primarily associated with decreases in United States production, which had a lower cost basis relative to combined Argentine and Canadian per BOE cost basis, and to downward revisions to proved reserves as a result of lower commodity prices. Exploration, abandonments, geological and geophysical costs. Exploration, abandonments, geological and geophysical costs totaled $85.9 million, $127.9 million and $87.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The following table sets forth the components of the Companys 2002, 2001 and 2000 exploration and abandonments/geological and geophysical costs: United Other States Argentina Canada Foreign Total (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2002: Geological and geophysical costs........ $ 22,761 $ 4,138 $ 3,544 $ 7,223 $ 37,666 Exploratory dry holes................... 32,557 3,294 1,220 (539) 36,532 Leasehold abandonments and other........ 7,637 2,874 1,077 108 11,696 $ 62,955 $ 10,306 $ 5,841 $ 6,792 $ 85,894 Year Ended December 31, 2001: Geological and geophysical costs........ $ 29,620 $ 6,541 $ 2,373 $ 13,678 $ 52,212 Exploratory dry holes................... 34,883 6,040 5,473 10,432 56,828 Leasehold abandonments and other........ 5,546 11,276 2,036 8 18,866 $ 70,049 $ 23,857 $ 9,882 $ 24,118 $127,906 Year Ended December 31, 2000: Geological and geophysical costs........ $ 22,033 $ 6,881 $ 2,273 $ 7,761 $ 38,948 Exploratory dry holes................... 11,745 6,987 887 8,396 28,015 Leasehold abandonments and other........ 7,089 11,520 1,971 7 20,587 $ 40,867 $ 25,388 $ 5,131 $ 16,164 $ 87,550 The decrease in 2002 exploration, abandonments, geological and geophysical costs reflected a decline in Argentine exploration activities as the Company monitored and assessed the economic environment and risks associated with Argentina; a decline in exploratory dry holes and geological and geophysical costs in Africa, as the Company assessed its exploratory successes in Gabon and Tunisia; and the allocation of a larger percentage of the Companys 2002 capital budget to the development of its significant discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore South Africa. The increase in 2001 exploration costs, as compared to 2000, was primarily due to increased geological and geophysical costs that were supportive of exploratory drilling, increased exploratory drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and Argentina and an exploratory dry hole drilled in Tunisia. Approximately 20 percent of the Companys 2002 costs incurred for oil and gas producing activities were exploration costs as compared to 34 percent in 2001 and 38 percent in 2000. General and administrative expenses. The Companys general and administrative expenses totaled $48.4 million ($1.17 per BOE), $37.0 million ($.89 per BOE) and $33.3 million ($.76 per BOE) during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in administrative expense during 2002 as compared to 2001 was primarily due to the elimination of operating overhead being charged by the Company to the 42 affiliated partnerships that were merged into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company during December 2001 (see "Financial and Operating Performance" and Note D of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the 2001 merger). Additionally, the Company awarded 645,445 shares of restricted stock to directors, officers and key employees as part of the Companys compensation program. The Company recorded $16.2 million of deferred compensation associated with the restricted stock awards, which amount will be amortized to compensation expense during the vesting periods of the awards. Amortization of the deferred costs of the restricted stock increased general and administrative expenses by $1.9 million in 2002. See Note G of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for 31 information regarding the restricted stock awards and their vesting periods. The increase in general and administrative expense during 2001, as compared to 2000, was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense. Interest expense. Interest expense was $95.8 million, $132.0 million and $162.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decline in 2002 interest expense as compared to 2001, was primarily due to incremental interest savings of $18.0 million from the Companys interest rate hedging program; a $6.3 million increase in interest capitalized; interest savings from the retirement of the Companys outstanding 11 5/8 percent and 10 5/8 percent senior subordinated notes during the third quarter of 2001 and $38.7 million of the Companys 9 5/8 percent senior notes during the fourth quarter of 2001; interest savings from the repurchase of $47.1 million of 9 5/8 percent senior notes and $13.9 million of 8 7/8 percent senior notes during 2002; interest savings from the repayment of the $45.2 million West Panhandle gas field capital obligation in July 2002 which bore interest at an annual rate of 20 percent; and interest savings from reductions in underlying market interest rates. The decrease in interest expense for 2001 as compared to 2000 was primarily due to incremental interest savings of $7.0 million from the Companys interest rate hedging program; a $6.0 million increase in interest capitalized; and interest savings associated with the redemption of the Companys outstanding 11 5/8 percent and 10 5/8 percent senior subordinated notes and $38.7 million of the Companys 9 5/8 percent senior notes. As is discussed in "2003 Outlook" above, capitalized interest will decline during 2003, as compared to 2002 levels, primarily due to the completion of the Canyon Express development project during September 2002 and the anticipated completion of the Falcon and Sable development projects during the second quarter of 2003. Additionally, 2003 interest expense will be impacted by fair value hedges of the Companys 9 5/8 percent senior notes that were initiated by the Company during February 2003 and for which more detailed information is provided in "2003 Outlook" and in "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk". See Note E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information about the Companys long term debt, interest expense and extraordinary items. Other expenses. Other expenses were $17.3 million during 2002, as compared to $39.6 million during 2001 and $67.2 million during 2000. Other expenses during 2002 were primarily comprised of a $6.9 million charge from the remeasurement of the Companys Argentine peso denominated net monetary assets and liabilities and $2.5 million of marketing losses incurred to transport and sell purchased Canadian gas to a Chicago, Illinois sales point. See Note B and Note I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding currency remeasurement and gas transportation commitments. Other expenses in 2001 include $11.4 million of commodity derivative settlements that did not qualify for hedge treatment under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities"; $9.9 million of marketing losses incurred to transport and sell purchased Canadian gas to a Chicago, Illinois sales point; $7.7 million of losses from the remeasurement of the Companys Argentine peso denominated net monetary assets and an adjustment to reduce the carrying value of Argentine lease and well equipment inventory to market value; $6.0 million of bad debt expense related to derivative contracts with Enron North America Corp. and $4.6 million of other expenses. The primary component of other expense during 2000 was $58.5 million of mark to market losses on derivative contracts that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, including $43.9 million of losses on derivative contracts that matured during 2000 and $14.6 million of losses associated with the Companys Btu swap agreements that mature at the end of December 2004. During 2001, the Company entered into offsetting swap agreements that had fixed the prices that are to be received and paid by the Company under the Btu swap agreements. Consequently, the Btu swap agreements are no longer sensitive to changes in oil or gas commodity prices. Income tax provisions (benefits). The Company recognized consolidated income tax provisions of $5.1 million and $4.0 million during 2002 and 2001, respectively, and a consolidated income tax benefit of $6.0 million during 2000. The Companys consolidated tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2002 was comprised of current U.S. state and local taxes of $.2 million, current foreign taxes of $2.1 million and deferred foreign tax provisions of $2.8 million. The Companys consolidated tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2001 was comprised of current U.S. state and local taxes of $1.1 million, current foreign taxes of $10.5 million and deferred foreign tax benefits of $7.6 million. The Companys consolidated tax benefit in 2000 was comprised of a $10.6 million deferred tax benefit in Argentina, partially offset by $4.6 million of current taxes paid in Argentina. 32 Due to uncertainties regarding the Companys ability to realize certain of its net operating loss carryovers and tax credit carryovers prior to their scheduled expirations, the Company has established a valuation allowance of $277.2 million against those carryovers. Although the Company believes it is more likely than not that the carrying values of its remaining deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable earnings or alternative tax planning strategies, the net deferred tax assets could be reduced further if the Companys estimate of taxable income in future periods is significantly reduced or alternative tax planning strategies are no longer viable. As a result of this situation, it is likely that the Companys effective tax rate in 2003 will be minimal in the United States and Canada and approximately 35 percent in Argentina. See Note O of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for information regarding the Companys income tax, deferred tax asset valuation reserves and net operating loss carryforward expirations. Extraordinary items. During 2002, the Company repurchased $47.1 million of its 9 5/8 percent senior notes, $13.9 million of its 8 7/8 percent senior notes and repaid a $45.2 million West Panhandle field capital cost obligation. Associated with the 2002 debt extinguishments, the Company recognized an extraordinary loss, net of taxes, of $22.3 million. During 2001, the Company redeemed the remaining $22.5 million of its outstanding 11 5/8 percent senior subordinated notes, $6.8 million of its outstanding 10 5/8 percent senior subordinated notes and repurchased $38.7 million of its 9 5/8 percent senior notes. Associated with these debt extinguishments, the Company recognized an extraordinary loss, net of taxes, of $3.8 million. During 2000, the Company replaced its prior credit facility, which was scheduled to mature in August 2002, with a new $575 million corporate credit facility due March 1, 2005 (the "Credit Agreement"). Associated therewith, the Company recognized a $12.3 million extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt. See "New Accounting Pronouncements", above, for information regarding future changes in the classification of the Companys extraordinary gains and losses. Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity Capital commitments. The Companys primary needs for cash are for exploration, development and acquisitions of oil and gas properties, repayment of contractual obligations and working capital obligations. Funding for exploration, development and acquisitions of oil and gas properties and repayment of contractual obligations may be provided by any combination of internally generated cash flow, proceeds from the disposition of non strategic assets or alternative financing sources as discussed in "Capital resources" below. Funding for the Companys working capital obligations is provided by internally generated cash flow. Oil and gas properties. The Companys cash expenditures for additions to oil and gas properties during 2002, 2001 and 2000 totaled $614.7 million, $529.7 million and $299.7 million, respectively. The Companys 2002 expenditures for additions to oil and gas properties were funded by $332.2 million of net cash provided by operating activities, $118.9 million of proceeds from the disposition of assets and a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of 11.5 million shares of the Companys common stock during April 2002. The Companys 2001 expenditures were internally funded by $475.6 million of net cash provided by operating activities and a portion of the Companys $113.5 million of proceeds from disposition of assets. The Companys 2000 capital expenditures were internally funded by net cash provided by operating activities. The Company strives to maintain its indebtedness at reasonable levels in order to provide sufficient financial flexibility to take advantage of future opportunities. The Companys capital budget for 2003 is expected to range from $450 million to $550 million. The Company believes that net cash provided by operating activities during 2003 will be sufficient to fund the 2003 capital expenditures budget. Contractual obligations, including off balance sheet obligations. The Companys contractual obligations include long term debt, operating leases, Btu swap agreements, terminated commodity hedges and other contracts. From time to time, the Company enters into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off balance sheet obligations of the Company. As of December 31, 2002, the material off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that the Company has entered into include (i) $27.2 million of undrawn letters of credit issued under the Companys $575 million corporate credit facility and (ii) operating lease agreements under which the Companys future minimum lease commitments are summarized in the table below and in Note I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data". Contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable include derivative contracts that are sensitive to future changes in commodity prices, currency exchange rates and interest rates and gas transportation commitments. See "Item 33 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for a table of changes in the fair value of the Companys derivative contract assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2002 and Note I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding gas transportation commitments. The following table summarizes the Companys payments due by period for fixed and determinable contractual obligations: Payments Due by Year 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter (in thousands) Long term debt (a)............. $ $ $ 406,704 $ 161,130 $1,100,702 Operating leases (b)........... 19,364 41,553 39,375 58,924 36,338 Btu swap agreements (c)........ 7,168 7,190 Terminated commodity hedges.... 484 340 $ 27,016 $ 49,083 $ 446,079 $ 220,054 $1,137,040 (a) See Note E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data". (b) See Note I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data". (c) See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data". Capital resources. The Companys primary capital resources are net cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from financing activities and proceeds from sales of non strategic assets. The Company expects that these resources will be sufficient to fund its capital commitments in 2003. Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities during 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $332.2 million, $475.6 million and $430.1 million, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2002 decreased by $143.4 million, or 30 percent, as compared to that of 2001. The decrease in 2002 net cash provided by operating activities was principally due to declines in commodity prices, offset partially by declines in interest expense. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2001 increased by $45.5 million, or 11 percent, as compared to that of 2000. The increase in 2001 was primarily due to higher commodity prices as compared to 2000, declines in interest expense and an increase in trade receivable collections. Financing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Companys financing activities provided $170.9 million of cash, comprised of $236.0 million of proceeds, net of issuance costs, from the sale of 11.5 million shares of the Companys common stock; $48.0 million of net borrowings of long term debt; and $14.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of long term incentive plan stock options and employee stock purchases. Partially offsetting these cash proceeds from financing activities were $124.2 million of payments of noncurrent liabilities and $3.3 million of debt issuance costs during 2002. In contrast, during the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company used $64.0 million and $244.1 million, respectively, of net cash in financing activities. During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company used $5.1 million and $177.3 million of cash, respectively, to repay long term debt; $53.4 million and $29.8 million, respectively, to repay noncurrent liabilities; $13.0 million and $27.3 million, respectively, to purchase treasury stock; and, during the year ended December 31, 2000, $13.8 million for deferred loan and debt issuance costs. Partially offsetting the above described net cash uses from financing activities were $7.5 million and $4.2 million of net cash provided from the exercise of long term incentive plan stock options and employee stock purchases during the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Over the three year period ended December 31, 2002, the Company has used $134.4 million of cash for net reductions in long term borrowings and has reduced its ratio of debt to book capitalization to 55 percent as of December 31, 2002, from 69 percent as of December 31, 1999. Additionally, the Company has entered into financing transactions with the intent of reducing its costs of capital and increasing liquidity through the extension of debt maturities. During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company entered into interest rate swap contracts to hedge the fair value of its 6 1/2 percent senior notes, its 8 7/8 percent senior notes and its 8 1/4 percent senior notes. The Company also entered into interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of its interest rate risk under the Credit Agreement. In 2002 and 2001, the Company terminated its open interest rate swap portfolios to lock in the substantial fair value of the derivatives. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had $35.7 million of 34 deferred gains associated with the interest rate swap terminations recorded as an increase in the carrying value of the Companys long term debt. During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, net gains from the Companys interest rate swaps have reduced interest expense by $25.3 million, $7.3 million and $.3 million, respectively. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data" and "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for more information about the Companys interest rate hedging activities. As is further described in "Results of Operations" above, during the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company repurchased $47.1 million of its 9 5/8 percent senior notes, $13.9 million of its 8 7/8 percent senior notes and repaid a $45.2 million West Panhandle gas field capital cost obligation. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company redeemed its remaining 11 5/8 percent and 10 5/8 percent senior subordinated notes and $38.7 million of its 9 5/8 percent senior notes. At December 31, 2002, the Company had a $575.0 million corporate credit facility with a syndicate of banks that matures on March 1, 2005. Outstanding borrowings under the corporate credit facility totaled $260.0 million as of December 31, 2002. In addition, the Company has five outstanding senior note issuances at December 31, 2002. Such debt issuances consist of (i) $136.1 million aggregate principal amount of 8 7/8 percent senior notes due in 2005; (ii) $150 million aggregate principal amount of 8 1/4 percent senior notes due in 2007; (iii) $350 million aggregate principal amount of 6 1/2 percent senior notes due in 2008; (iv) $339.2 million aggregate remaining principal amount of 9 5/8 percent senior notes due in 2010; (v) $150 million aggregate principal amount of 7 1/2 percent senior notes due in 2012; and (vi) $250 million aggregate principal amount of 7 1/5 percent senior notes due in 2028. Certain of the obligations above contain restrictive covenants, each of which the Company is in compliance. The weighted average interest rate on the Companys indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 5.74 percent as compared to 7.52 percent for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 8.68 percent for the year ended December 31, 2000, taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps. See Note E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for more specific information regarding the Companys long term debt as of December 31, 2002 and 2001. As the Company pursues its strategy, it may utilize various financing sources, including fixed and floating rate debt, convertible securities, preferred stock or common stock. The Company may also issue securities in exchange for oil and gas properties, stock or other interests in other oil and gas companies or related assets. Additional securities may be of a class preferred to common stock with respect to such matters as dividends and liquidation rights and may also have other rights and preferences as determined by the Companys Board of Directors. Sales of non strategic assets. During 2002, 2001 and 2000, proceeds from the sale of non strategic assets totaled $118.9 million, $113.5 million and $102.7 million, respectively. The Companys 2002, 2001 and 2000 asset divestitures were comprised of hedge derivatives, common stock of a non affiliated entity, and non strategic United States and Canadian oil and gas properties, gas plants and other assets. The cash proceeds received from asset divestitures during 2002 and 2001 were used to fund a portion of the Companys 2002 and 2001 capital expenditures and for general corporate obligations. The net cash proceeds from the 2000 asset divestitures were used to reduce the Companys outstanding indebtedness (see "Results of Operations", above, and Note M of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"). Book capitalization and liquidity. The Companys total debt was $1.67 billion as of December 31, 2002, as compared to total debt of $1.58 billion on December 31, 2001 and 2000. The Companys total book capitalization at December 31, 2002 was $3.04 billion, consisting of total debt of $1.67 billion and stockholders equity of $1.37 billion. The Companys debt to total capitalization was 55 percent at December 31, 2002. The Companys ratio of current assets to current liabilities was .54 at December 31, 2002 and 1.12 at December 31, 2001. The decline in the Companys ratio of current assets to current liabilities was primarily due to a $170.7 million difference in the fair value of 2003 maturing derivatives at December 31, 2002 as compared to the fair value of 2002 maturing derivatives at December 31, 2001. Including $27.2 million of undrawn and outstanding letters of credit, the Company has $287.8 million of unused borrowing capacity available under its Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2002. 35 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following quantitative and qualitative information is provided about financial instruments to which the Company was a party as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and from which the Company may incur future gains or losses from changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. Although certain derivative contracts that the Company is a party to do not qualify as hedges, the Company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading purposes. The fair value of the Companys derivative contracts are determined based on counterparties estimates and valuation models. The Company has not changed its valuation method during 2002. During 2002, the Company was a party to forward foreign exchange contracts, commodity and interest rate swap contracts and commodity collar contracts. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys derivative contracts, including deferred gains and losses on terminated derivative contracts. The following table reconciles the changes that occurred in the fair values of the Companys open derivative contracts during 2002: Derivative Contract Assets (Liabilities) Foreign Interest Exchange Commodity Rate Rate Total (in thousands) Fair value of contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2001.............. $ 180,554 $ (19,637) $ 61 $ 160,978 Changes in contract fair values (1)......

Quantitative Disclosures Interest rate sensitivity. The following tables provide information, in U. S. dollar equivalent amounts, about other financial instruments that the Company was a party to as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 and that are or were sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the tables present maturities by expected maturity dates together with the weighted average interest rates expected to be paid on the debt, given current contractual terms and market conditions. For fixed rate debt, the weighted average interest rate represents the contractual fixed rates that the Company was obligated to periodically pay on the debt as of December 31, 2002 and 2001. For variable rate debt, the average interest rate represents the average rates being paid on the debt projected forward proportionate to the forward yield curves for the six month London Interbank Offered Rate. 36 Interest Rate Sensitivity Derivative and Other Financial Instruments as of December 31, 2002 (1) Liability 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Total Fair Value (in thousands except interest rates) Total Debt: U.S. dollar denominated maturities: Fixed rate debt............ $ $ $146,704 $ $161,130 $1,100,702 $1,408,536 $(1,484,009) Weighted average interest rate (%)........ 7.94 7.94 7.87 7.83 7.81 7.77 Variable rate debt......... $ $ $260,000 $ $ $ $ 260,000 $ (260,000) Average interest rate (%).. 2.89 4.08 5.27 (1) During February 2003, the Company entered into interest rate swap contracts to hedge a portion of the fair value of its 9 5/8 percent senior notes. Under the terms of the interest rate swap contracts, the Company will receive a fixed annual rate of 9 5/8 percent on $250 million notional amount and will pay the counterparties a variable rate on the notional amount equal to the six month LIBOR, reset semi annually, plus a weighted average margin of 566.4 basis points. The accompanying Interest Rate Sensitivity table as of December 31, 2001 also provides information about interest rate swap agreements that the Company was a party to as of that date. These interest rate swap agreements were terminated during the year ended December 31, 2002 and no longer represent market risk to the Company. The interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2001 hedged (i) the fair value of the Companys 8 1/4 percent senior notes; (ii) the fair value of the Companys 6 1/2 percent senior notes; and (iii) a portion of the interest rate risk associated with the Companys Credit Agreement.

The Company is a borrower under fixed rate and variable rate debt instruments that give rise to interest rate risk. The Companys objective in borrowing under fixed or variable rate debt is to satisfy capital requirements while minimizing the Companys costs of capital. To realize its objectives, the Company borrows under fixed and variable rate debt instruments, based on the availability of capital, market conditions and hedge opportunities. See Note E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a discussion of the Companys debt instruments. Derivative financial instruments. The Company has, from time to time, entered into interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity price derivative contracts to hedge interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity price risks in accordance with policies and guidelines approved by the Companys board of directors. In accordance with those policies and guidelines, the Companys executive management determines the appropriate timing and extent of hedge transactions. Although the Company is a party to certain derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the Companys policy is to limit its participation in derivative contracts to those that, in the opinion of management, reduce the Companys overall economic risk. As of December 31, 2002, the Companys primary risk exposures associated with financial instruments to which it is a party include oil and gas price volatility, volatility in the exchange rates of the Canadian dollar and Argentine peso vis a vis the U.S. dollar and interest rate volatility. The Companys primary risk exposures associated with financial instruments have not changed significantly since December 31, 2002. 40
