ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2003 Highlights Pioneers financial and operating results for the year ended December 31, 2003 included the following highlights: o Production volumes increased 36 percent in 2003 as compared to 2002, principally due to the completion of the Canyon Express, Falcon and Sable development projects. o Oil and gas revenue increased 85 percent in 2003 as a result of the increased production volumes and increases in North American gas and worldwide oil prices. o Pre tax income increased to $330.8 million from $31.8 million in 2002. o Pioneers solid progress towards its strategic objectives over the past four years and improving key economic indicators, together with other relevant factors and associated evaluations, led the Company to reverse its allowances against United States deferred tax assets during 2003. The reversal of the allowances against United States deferred tax assets resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax benefit of $197.7 million during 2003 of which $104.7 million was reversed in the third quarter of 2003 (see Note P of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the reversal of the allowances against the Companys United States deferred tax assets). o Net cash provided by operating activities increased 130 percent to $763.7 million in 2003 as compared to $332.2 million in 2002. o The Company replaced its $575 million revolving credit facility with a new five year $700 million revolving credit agreement with terms similar to investment grade companies. o The Company participated in exploration discoveries in the Harrier, Tomahawk and Raptor fields in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the Hawa field in Tunisia. o The Company completed a strategic acquisition of the remaining 25 percent working interest that the Company did not already own in the Falcon field, Harrier field and surrounding satellite prospects. o The Company was the high bidder on 53 tracts covering an additional 159,000 acres on the Alaskan North Slope. o The Company succeeded in obtaining ministerial approval for improved terms associated with the Olowi permit in Gabon and booked 16.6 MMBOE of proved reserves in Gabon during 2003. o The Companys successful capital investment programs resulted in the replacement of 193 percent and 216 percent of production during the one and three year periods ended December 31, 2003, respectively, resulting in total proved reserves of 789.1 MMBOE at December 31, 2003. o The Company reported acquisition and finding costs per BOE of $6.64 and $6.76 during the one and three year periods ended December 31, 2003, respectively. 2003 Financial and Operating Performance During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded net income of $410.6 million, $26.7 million and $100.0 million ($3.46, $.23 and $1.00 per diluted share), respectively. Compared to 2002, the Companys 2003 total revenues and other income increased by $594.8 million, or 83 percent, including a $596.9 million increase in oil and gas revenues. The increase in oil 26 and gas revenues was due to increases in production volumes and increases of 12 percent, 40 percent and 53 percent in average oil, NGL and gas prices, respectively, including the effects of commodity price hedges. Compared to 2002, the Companys total costs and expenses increased by $295.8 million, or 43 percent, during the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in total costs and expenses was primarily reflective of a $46.9 million increase in exploration and abandonments expense, primarily due to increased exploration/extension drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, Argentina, Canada and South Africa, a $174.5 million increase in depletion, depreciation and amortization expense, primarily driven by increases in depletion associated with increased production volumes from higher cost basis Gulf of Mexico and South Africa properties and an $80.0 million increase in oil and gas production costs, which primarily resulted from increases in production volumes, the strengthening of both the Argentine peso and Canadian dollar and commodity prices that impacted variable lease operating expenses and production taxes, partially offset by an $18.3 million decrease in other expense, primarily due to $22.3 million of losses recognized during 2002 associated with debt extinguished prior to its stated maturity. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Companys net cash provided by operating activities increased to $763.7 million, as compared to $332.2 million during 2002 and $475.6 million during 2001. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2003 was primarily due to increases in oil, NGL and gas production volumes and prices, as discussed above. During the year ended December 31, 2003, successful capital investment activities increased the Companys proved reserves to 789.1 MMBOE, reflecting the effects of strategic acquisitions of properties in the Companys core operating areas and a successful drilling program which resulted in the replacement of 193 percent of production at an acquisition and finding cost per BOE of $6.64. During the three years ended December 31, 2003, Pioneer has replaced 216 percent of production at an acquisition and finding cost per BOE of $6.76. Costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $723.0 million, including $151.0 million of proved and unproved property acquisitions and $572.0 million of exploration and development drilling and seismic expenditures. See "Results of Operations" and "Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity", below, for more in depth discussions of the Companys oil and gas producing activities, including discussions pertaining to oil and gas production volumes, prices, hedging activities, costs and expenses, capital commitments, capital resources and liquidity. 2004 Outlook Commodity prices. World oil prices increased during the year ended December 31, 2003 in response to political unrest and supply disruptions in the Middle East as well as other supply and demand factors. North American gas prices also increased during 2003 in response to continued strong supply and demand fundamentals. The Companys outlook for 2004 commodity prices is cautiously optimistic. Significant factors that will impact 2004 commodity prices include developments in Iraq and other Middle East countries, the extent to which members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil exporting nations are able to manage oil supply through export quotas and variations in key North American gas supply and demand indicators. Pioneer will continue to strategically hedge oil and gas price risk to mitigate the impact of price volatility on its oil, NGL and gas revenues. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had hedged 18,973 barrels per day of 2004 oil production under swap contracts with a weighted average fixed price to be received of $25.84 per Bbl. The Company had also hedged 283,962 Mcf per day of 2004 gas production under swap contracts with a weighted average fixed price to be received of $4.16 per MMBtu. During January 2004, the Company increased its 2004 commodity hedge positions by entering into 32,967 Mcf per day of first quarter gas swap contracts with average per MMBtu fixed prices of $7.11. Additionally, at December 31, 2003 the Company had net deferred gains on terminated oil hedge contracts of $1.0 million that will be recognized as increases to oil revenue during 2004 and $42.9 million of net deferred gains on terminated gas hedge contracts that will be recognized as increases to gas revenue during 2004. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys commodity hedge positions at December 31, 2003. Also see "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for disclosures about the Companys commodity related derivative financial instruments. 27 Capital expenditures. During 2004, the Companys budget for oil and gas capital activities is expected to range from $550 million to $600 million, of which approximately 65 percent has been budgeted for development drilling and facility costs and 35 percent for exploration expenditures. The Companys 2004 capital budget is allocated approximately 70 percent to the United States, 19 percent to Argentina and the remaining 11 percent is budgeted for expenditures in Canada, Gabon, Tunisia, South Africa and other foreign areas. Pioneer expects to drill approximately 400 exploration and development wells during 2004. During 2004 and 2005, the Company expects to expend approximately $219 million and $348 million, respectively, of capital for development drilling and facility costs related to its proved undeveloped reserves. Production growth. The Company expects that its annual 2004 worldwide production will range from 65 MMBOE to 73 MMBOE, or approximately 178 MBOE to 200 MBOE per day, an increase of 15 percent to 29 percent over 2003 levels. The bottom end of the range includes a full year of production from the Companys deepwater Gulf of Mexico Falcon and Harrier gas fields, the Sable oil field in South Africa and the Hawa field in Tunisia, coupled with increases in production from the Companys 2004 capital program and the inherent variability in production results. The Company expects, based on quoted futures prices, to generate cash flow significantly in excess of its capital program and has considered the potential to invest a portion of the excess cash for additional development drilling or core area acquisitions in arriving at the top end of the 2004 production range. The outlook for continued production growth in 2005 is strong considering that first production from several new projects is not expected until well into 2004. The Company will have its first full year of production from the Devils Tower, Tomahawk and Raptor deepwater fields during 2005, and the Company believes it has sufficient development inventory to support production growth in the United States, Argentina, Canada and Tunisia. As a result, Pioneer currently expects production in 2005 to match 2004 at a minimum, with considerable upside given the potential investment of excess cash flow to develop new exploration successes and or acquire additional assets in core areas during 2004 and 2005. Longer term, with several discoveries to develop for 2006 and beyond, a pipeline of exploration opportunities, potential for continued core area acquisitions, continuing strong commodity prices and significant excess cash flow, Pioneer has targeted five year average compounded annual production growth of ten percent. Costs and expenses. The Company expects that its costs and expenses that are highly correlated with production volumes, such as production costs and depletion expense, will increase in absolute amounts during 2004. Additionally, the Company expects that depletion expense will increase on a per BOE basis during 2004 as compared to 2003 due to new production from Harrier, Tomahawk, Raptor and Devils Tower fields in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and increased production from the Sable oil field offshore South Africa. The per BOE cost bases of these fields are higher than that of Pioneers average producing property in 2003. Additionally, the average per BOE lifting costs of Devils Tower and Sable oil field production are expected to exceed the Companys average 2003 per BOE lifting costs. The Company expects average per BOE production taxes to decline during 2004 as compared to 2003 as the production from the aforementioned properties are not burdened by such taxes. Ad valorem taxes are highly correlated with prior year commodity prices. As a consequence of increases in oil, NGL and gas prices during 2003, ad valorem taxes are expected to be higher in 2004, as compared to 2003. The Company anticipates an increase in general and administrative expenses during 2004 due to additional staffing and the amortization of restricted stock that is being awarded to officers and employees in lieu of stock options, which were awarded in prior years. Capital allocation. Four years ago, the Company made a commitment to move its financial position to investment grade standards, and significant improvement has been accomplished during that period with year end 2003 debt to book capitalization reaching 46.9 percent as compared to 69.3 percent at the end of 1999. The Company has established a targeted range for debt to book capitalization of 37 percent to 43 percent. Given the expanding financial strength of the Company and expectations for significant cash flow in excess of its capital budget, the Company expects to use a portion of its excess cash flow in 2004 to further reduce long term debt by a minimum of $100 million. Additionally, the Company s Board of Directors have approved a plan to begin a dividend program of $.20 per common share, payable in two semi annual installments of $.10 per common share, beginning in 2004. 28 During 2004 through 2006, the Company anticipates, based upon year end futures prices, that it will have significant excess cash flow even after funding its typical annual capital budgets, planned dividends and achieving its leverage targets. The Company considers it a high priority to utilize a portion of the excess cash flow to fund the development of new exploration successes and to selectively acquire additional assets in its core areas. The Company will also consider using a portion of the excess cash flow for share repurchases. First quarter 2004. Based on current estimates, the Company expects that its first quarter 2004 production will average 168,000 to 183,000 BOEs per day, reflecting the incremental production from Harrier which began producing in January, the variability of oil cargo shipments in Tunisia and South Africa and the seasonal decline in gas demand during Argentinas summer season. First quarter production costs are expected to average $5.00 to $5.50 per BOE based on current NYMEX strip prices for oil and gas. Deprecation, depletion and amortization expense is expected to average $7.75 to $8.25 per BOE as a greater proportion of the Companys production is being produced from higher cost basis deepwater Gulf of Mexico and South Africa properties. Total exploration and abandonment expense is expected to be $25 million to $85 million. The first quarter range includes a number of high impact deepwater Gulf of Mexico wells that are in progress, up to five wells expected in Gabon to further refine development plans and test a new exploration target, increased exploration drilling in Argentina and the winter drilling program in Canada. General and administrative expense is expected to be $17 million to $20 million, $2 million to $3 million of which relates to estimated performance based compensation costs. Interest expense is expected to be $21 million to $23 million and accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations is expected to be approximately $2 million. The Company recognizes deferred income taxes reflecting its tax position in each of its areas of operation. However, cash income taxes are expected to be only $3 million to $5 million, principally related to Argentine income taxes and nominal alternative minimum tax in the United States. Other than in Argentina, the Company continues to benefit from the carryforward of net operating losses and other positive tax attributes. Critical Accounting Estimates The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements for inclusion in this Report in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). See Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a comprehensive discussion of the Companys significant accounting policies. GAAP represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements, the application of which requires management judgments and estimates including, in certain circumstances, choices between acceptable GAAP alternatives. Following is a discussion of the Companys most critical accounting estimates, judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the Companys application of GAAP: Accounting for oil and gas producing activities. The accounting for and disclosure of oil and gas producing activities requires the Companys management to choose between GAAP alternatives and to make judgments about estimates of future uncertainties. Successful efforts method of accounting. The Company utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities as opposed to the alternate acceptable full cost method. In general, the Company believes that, during periods of active exploration, net assets and net income are more conservatively measured under the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities than under the full cost method. The critical difference between the successful efforts method of accounting and the full cost method is as follows: under the successful efforts method, exploratory dry holes and geological and geophysical exploration costs are charged against earnings during the periods in which they occur; whereas, under the full cost method of accounting, such costs and expenses are capitalized as assets, pooled with the costs of successful wells and charged against the earnings of future periods as a component of depletion expense. During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company recognized exploration, abandonment, geological and geophysical expense of $132.8 million, $85.9 million and $127.9 million, respectively, under the successful efforts method. Proved reserve estimates. Estimates of the Companys proved reserves included in this Report are prepared in accordance with GAAP and SEC guidelines. The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of: o the quality and quantity of available data; o the interpretation of that data; 29 o the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and o the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate. The Companys proved reserve information included in this Report as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 was based on evaluations audited by independent petroleum engineers with respect to the Companys major properties and prepared by the Companys engineers with respect to all other properties. The Companys proved reserve information included in this Report as of December 31, 2001 was based on evaluations prepared by the Companys engineers. Estimates prepared by other third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein. Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, all of which may substantially differ from future actual results, reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate. It should not be assumed that the present value of future net cash flows included in this Report as of December 31, 2003 is the current market value of the Companys estimated proved reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the Company based the estimated present value of future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. The Companys estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion expense. If the estimates of proved reserves decline, the rate at which the Company records depletion expense will increase, reducing future net income. Such a decline may result from lower market prices, which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields. In addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of the Companys assessment of its oil and gas producing properties for impairment. Impairment of proved oil and gas properties. The Company reviews its long lived proved properties to be held and used whenever management determines that events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable. Management assesses whether or not an impairment provision is necessary based upon its outlook of future commodity prices and net cash flows that may be generated by the properties. Proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment by depletable pool, which is the lowest level at which depletion of proved properties is calculated. Impairment of unproved oil and gas properties. Management periodically assesses individually significant unproved oil and gas properties for impairment, on a project by project basis. Managements assessment of the results of exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects impact the amount and timing of impairment provisions. Suspended wells. The Company suspends the costs of exploratory wells that discover hydrocarbons pending a final determination of the commercial potential of the related oil and gas fields. The ultimate disposition of these well costs is dependent on the results of future drilling activity and development decisions. If the Company decides not to pursue additional appraisal activities or development of these fields, the costs of these wells will be charged to exploration and abandonment expense. At December 31, 2003, the Company had $88.6 million of suspended exploratory well costs included in property, plant and equipment. Assessments of functional currencies. Management determines the functional currencies of the Companys subsidiaries based on an assessment of the currency of the economic environment in which a subsidiary primarily realizes and expends its operating revenues, costs and expenses. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of all of the Companys international operations except Canada. The assessment of functional currencies can have a significant impact on periodic results of operations and financial position. Argentine economic and currency measures. The accounting for and remeasurement of the Companys Argentine balance sheets as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 reflect managements assumptions regarding some uncertainties unique to Argentinas current economic situation. See Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a description of the assumptions utilized in the preparation of these financial statements. The Argentine economic and political situation continues 30 to evolve and the Argentine government may enact future regulations or policies that, when finalized and adopted, may materially impact, among other items, (i) the realized prices the Company receives for the commodities it produces and sells; (ii) the timing of repatriations of excess cash flow to the Companys corporate headquarters in the United States; (iii) the Companys asset valuations; and (iv) peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances. From 1998 until 2003, the Company maintained a valuation allowance against a portion of its deferred tax asset position in the United States. SFAS 109 requires that the Company continually assess both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets can be realized prior to their expiration. In the third quarter of 2003 and as of December 31, 2003, the Company concluded that it is more likely than not that it will realize its gross deferred tax asset position in the United States after giving consideration to relevant facts and circumstances. Accordingly, during the third quarter of 2003, the Company reversed its remaining valuation allowance in the United States, resulting in the recognition of a deferred tax benefit of $104.7 million. For 2003 in total, the Company reversed $197.7 million of United States valuation allowances resulting in a net deferred tax benefit for the year. Further, the third quarter 2003 reversal of the allowance increased stockholders equity by $32.6 million as the Company recognized the tax effects of previous stock option exercises and deferred hedging gains and losses in other comprehensive income. See Note P of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys United States deferred tax assets and a specific discussion of the relevant facts and circumstances that were assessed. Pioneer will continue to monitor Company specific, oil and gas industry and worldwide economic factors and will reassess the likelihood that the Companys net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax attributes in each jurisdiction will be utilized prior to their expiration. There can be no assurances that facts and circumstances will not materially change and require the Company to reestablish a United States deferred tax asset valuation allowance in a future period. As of December 31, 2003, the Company does not believe there is sufficient positive evidence to reverse its valuation allowances related to foreign tax jurisdictions. Litigation and environmental contingencies. The Company makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for ongoing litigation and environmental remediation. Actual costs can vary from such estimates for a variety of reasons. The costs to settle litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws and opinions and assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, environmental remediation liabilities are subject to change because of changes in laws, regulations, additional information obtained relating to the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"), a liability is recorded for these types of contingencies if the Company determines the loss to be both probable and reasonably estimated. See Note I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys commitments and contingencies. Results of Operations Oil and gas revenues. Revenues from oil and gas operations totaled $1.3 billion during 2003, as compared to $701.8 million during 2002 and $847.0 million during 2001, representing an 85 percent increase from 2002 to 2003. The revenue increase from 2002 to 2003 was due to a 36 percent increase in BOE production, a 12 percent increase in oil prices, a 40 percent increase in NGL prices and a 53 percent increase in gas prices, including the effects of commodity price hedges. The increased production is principally attributable to incremental gas production from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico Canyon Express and Falcon field projects, initial oil production in South Africa and Tunisia and increased oil and gas production in Argentina, offset by normal production declines. The revenue decrease from 2001 to 2002 was principally due to year on year worldwide average oil, NGL and gas price declines of five percent, 19 percent and 23 percent, respectively, including the effects of commodity price hedges, and an eight percent decline in worldwide oil production, partially offset by worldwide NGL and gas production increases of four percent and two percent, respectively. 31 The following table provides production volumes and average reported prices, including the results of hedging activities, by geographic area and in total, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001: Year ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Average daily production: Oil (Bbls) United States................................... 24,525 23,437 23,641 Argentina....................................... 8,687 7,984 9,769 Canada.......................................... 111 124 831 Africa.......................................... 1,981 Worldwide....................................... 35,304 31,545 34,241 NGLs (Bbls) United States................................... 20,338 20,512 19,815 Argentina....................................... 1,318 696 547 Canada.......................................... 906 946 1,008 Worldwide....................................... 22,562 22,154 21,370 Gas (Mcf) United States................................... 445,609 232,360 212,629 Argentina....................................... 94,128 78,220 87,204 Canada.......................................... 41,669 48,365 50,481 Worldwide....................................... 581,406 358,945 350,314 Total (BOE) United States................................... 119,129 82,677 78,893 Argentina....................................... 25,694 21,716 24,851 Canada.......................................... 7,962 9,131 10,253 Africa.......................................... 1,981 Worldwide....................................... 154,766 113,524 113,997 Average reported prices: Oil (per Bbl) United States................................... $ 25.25 $ 23.66 $ 24.34 Argentina....................................... $ 25.62 $ 20.63 $ 23.79 Canada.......................................... $ 29.10 $ 22.26 $ 21.87 Africa.......................................... $ 29.52 $ $ Worldwide....................................... $ 25.59 $ 22.89 $ 24.12 NGL (per Bbl) United States................................... $ 19.04 $ 13.77 $ 16.88 Argentina....................................... $ 22.85 $ 14.56 $ 19.29 Canada.......................................... $ 24.80 $ 16.77 $ 21.11 Worldwide....................................... $ 19.50 $ 13.92 $ 17.14 Gas (per Mcf) United States................................... $ 4.49 $ 3.16 $ 4.10 Argentina....................................... $ .56 $ .48 $ 1.31 Canada.......................................... $ 3.90 $ 2.50 $ 2.86 Worldwide....................................... $ 3.81 $ 2.49 $ 3.23 Annual percentage increase (decrease) in average worldwide reported prices: Oil............................................. 12 (5) NGL............................................. 40 (19) (15) Gas............................................. 53 (23) 15 Hedging activities. The oil and gas prices that the Company reports are based on the market price received for the commodities adjusted by the results of the Companys cash flow hedging activities. The Company utilizes commodity swap and collar contracts in order to (i) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities the Company produces and sells, (ii) support the Companys annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and (iii) reduce commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects. The effective portions of changes in the fair values of the Companys commodity price hedges are deferred as increases or decreases to stockholders equity until the underlying hedged transaction occurs. Consequently, changes in the effective portions of commodity price hedges add volatility to the Companys reported stockholders equity until 32 the hedge derivative matures or is terminated. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for information concerning the impact to oil and gas revenues during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 from the Companys hedging activities, the Companys open hedge positions at December 31, 2003 and descriptions of the Companys hedge and non hedge commodity derivatives. Also see "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for additional disclosure about the Companys commodity related derivative financial instruments. Interest and other income. The Company recorded interest and other income totaling $12.3 million, $11.2 million and $21.8 during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Companys interest and other income was comprised of revenue that was not directly attributable to oil and gas producing activities or oil and gas property divestitures. See Note M of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding interest and other income. Gain on disposition of assets. During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company completed asset divestitures for net proceeds of $35.7 million, $118.9 million and $113.5 million, respectively. Associated therewith, the Company recorded gains on disposition of assets of $1.3 million, $4.4 million and $7.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The net cash proceeds from asset divestitures during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were used, together with net cash flows provided by operating activities, to fund additions to oil and gas properties and to reduce outstanding indebtedness. See Note N of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding asset divestitures. Oil and gas production costs. The Company recorded production costs of $279.5 million, $199.6 million and $209.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in total production costs during 2003 as compared to 2002 is primarily attributable to the increase in production volumes, while the decrease in total production costs during 2002 as compared to 2001 is principally attributable to lower production tax and field fuel expenses due to lower commodity prices. Total production costs per BOE increased during the year ended December 31, 2003 by three percent and decreased during the year ended December 31, 2002 by four percent. In general, lease operating expenses and workover expenses represent the components of oil and gas production costs over which the Company has management control, while production taxes, ad valorem taxes and field fuel expenses are directly related to commodity price changes. The increase in production costs per BOE during 2003 was primarily due to increases in per BOE lease operating expenses, field fuel expenses and production taxes, partially offset by decreases in per BOE ad valorem taxes and workover expenses. The increase in per BOE lease operating expenses was due to the strengthening of both the Argentine peso and the Canadian dollar, Argentine inflation and higher average lifting costs incurred on South African Sable oil field production, while the increases in per BOE field fuel expenses and production taxes primarily resulted from increases in North American gas prices and world oil prices. The decrease in per BOE ad valorem taxes is primarily due to the incremental production from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Argentina, South Africa and Tunisia fields which are not subject to ad valorem taxes. The decrease in production costs during 2002 was primarily due to decreases in field fuel expense and production taxes as a result of lower North American average gas prices and lower Argentine lease operating expenses resulting from lower Argentine expenses on a U.S. dollar equivalent basis due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso versus the U.S. dollar, partially offset by moderately higher workover expenses, ad valorem taxes (which are computed using prior year average annual commodity prices) and declines in the third party gas processing and treating margin component of lease operating expense. 33 The following tables provide the components of the Companys total production costs per BOE and total production costs per BOE by geographic area for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001: Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Lease operating expenses................. $ 3.07 $ 2.87 $ 2.76 Taxes: Production............................. .62 .54 .74 Ad valorem ............................ .40 .54 .49 Field fuel expenses...................... .72 .62 .88 Workover expenses........................ .14 .25 .17 Total production costs............. $ 4.95 $ 4.82 $ 5.04 Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Total production costs: United States.......................... $ 5.46 $ 5.80 $ 5.92 Argentina.............................. $ 2.78 $ 1.75 $ 2.93 Canada................................. $ 4.49 $ 3.23 $ 3.33 Africa................................. $ 3.99 $ $ Worldwide.............................. $ 4.95 $ 4.82 $ 5.04 Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense. The Companys total depletion, depreciation and amortization expense per BOE was $6.92, $5.22 and $5.35 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Depletion expense, the largest component of depletion, depreciation and amortization, was $6.75, $5.01 and $5.02 per BOE during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and depreciation and amortization of other property and equipment was $.17, $.21 and $.33 per BOE during each of the respective years. During 2003, the increase in per BOE depletion expense was due to increases in higher cost basis deepwater Gulf of Mexico and South African production volumes and downward revisions to proved reserves in Canada. The following table provides depletion expense per BOE by geographic area for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001: Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Depletion expense: United States.......................... $ 6.85 $ 4.64 $ 4.46 Argentina.............................. $ 4.96 $ 5.00 $ 5.67 Canada................................. $ 9.98 $ 8.36 $ 7.71 Africa................................. $ 10.69 $ $ Worldwide.............................. $ 6.75 $ 5.01 $ 5.02 34 Exploration, abandonments, geological and geophysical costs. Exploration, abandonments, geological and geophysical costs totaled $132.8 million, $85.9 million and $127.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The following table sets forth the components of the Companys exploration, abandonments, geological and geophysical costs by geographic region for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001: Africa United and States Argentina Canada Other Total (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2003: Geological and geophysical costs........ $ 40,783 $ 7,689 $ 4,426 $ 3,903 $ 56,801 Exploratory dry holes................... 27,015 2,672 10,963 20,250 60,900 Leasehold abandonments and other........ 4,934 7,715 2,302 108 15,059 $ 72,732 $ 18,076 $ 17,691 $ 24,261 $132,760 Year Ended December 31, 2002: Geological and geophysical costs........ $ 22,761 $ 4,138 $ 3,544 $ 7,223 $ 37,666 Exploratory dry holes................... 32,557 3,294 1,220 (539) 36,532 Leasehold abandonments and other........ 7,637 2,874 1,077 108 11,696 $ 62,955 $ 10,306 $ 5,841 $ 6,792 $ 85,894 Year Ended December 31, 2001: Geological and geophysical costs........ $ 29,620 $ 6,541 $ 2,373 $ 13,678 $ 52,212 Exploratory dry holes................... 34,883 6,040 5,473 10,432 56,828 Leasehold abandonments and other........ 5,546 11,276 2,036 8 18,866 $ 70,049 $ 23,857 $ 9,882 $ 24,118 $127,906 The increase in 2003 exploration, abandonments, geological and geophysical expense, as compared to 2002, was primarily due to increased geological and geophysical expenditures supportive of exploration activities in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska and a $24.4 million increase in exploratory dry hole expense. The increase in exploratory dry hole expense during 2003 was primarily due to an increase in Canadian exploratory drilling activities and three unsuccessful wells drilled in South Africa and one unsuccessful well drilled in Tunisia. The decrease in 2002 exploration, abandonments, geological and geophysical expense reflected a decline in Argentine exploration activities as the Company monitored and assessed the economic environment and risks associated with Argentina; a decline in exploratory dry holes and geological and geophysical expense in Africa, as the Company assessed its exploratory successes in Gabon and Tunisia; and the allocation of a larger percentage of the Companys 2002 capital budget to the development of its significant discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore South Africa. Approximately 38 percent of the Companys 2003 costs incurred for oil and gas producing activities were exploration costs as compared to 20 percent in 2002 and 34 percent in 2001. General and administrative expenses. The Companys general and administrative expenses totaled $60.5 million ($1.07 per BOE), $48.4 million ($1.17 per BOE) and $37.0 million ($.89 per BOE) during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expense during 2003, as compared to 2002, was primarily due to increases in administrative staff and performance related compensation costs, including the amortization of restricted stock awarded to officers, directors and key employees during 2003 and 2002. The increase in administrative expense during the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to 2001 was primarily due to the elimination of operating overhead being charged by the Company to the 42 affiliated partnerships that were merged into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company during December 2001 and amortization of restricted stock awarded in 2002. See Notes D and G of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for information regarding the affiliated partnership mergers and the restricted stock awards in 2003 and 2002 and their vesting periods, respectively. 35 Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations. During the year ended December 31, 2003 the Company recorded accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations of $5.0 million. The provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143") require that the accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations be classified in the consolidated statement of operations separate from interest expense. Prior to 2003 and the adoption of SFAS 143, the Company classified accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations as a component of interest expense. The Companys interest expense during each of the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 included $2.6 million of accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations that was calculated prior to the adoption of SFAS 143 based on asset retirement obligations recorded in purchased business combinations. See "Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle" below and Notes B and L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys adoption of SFAS 143. Interest expense. Interest expense was $91.4 million, $95.8 million and $132.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, while the weighted average interest rate on the Companys indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2003 was 5.3 percent as compared to 5.7 percent and 7.5 percent for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps. The decrease in interest expense for 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to $4.8 million of interest savings associated with the July 2002 repayment of a $45.2 million West Panhandle gas field capital obligation (the "West Panhandle Capital Obligation") which bore interest at an annual rate of 20 percent; $4.1 million of incremental savings from the Companys interest rate hedging program; a $2.6 million decrease in accretion expense (see "Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations", above); and lower underlying market interest rates and outstanding debt. Partially offsetting the decreases in interest expense was a $6.8 million decrease in interest capitalized during 2003 as compared to 2002 due to the completion of the Canyon Express and Falcon field development projects. The decline in 2002 interest expense as compared to 2001, was primarily due to incremental interest savings of $18.0 million from the Companys interest rate hedging program; a $6.3 million increase in interest capitalized; interest savings from the retirement of the Companys outstanding 11 5/8 percent and 10 5/8 percent senior subordinated notes during the third quarter of 2001and $38.7 million of the Companys 9 5/8 percent senior notes during the fourth quarter of 2001; interest savings from the repurchase of $47.1 million of 9 5/8 percent senior notes and $13.9 million of 8 7/8 percent senior notes during 2002; interest savings from the repayment of West Panhandle Capital Obligation; and interest savings from reductions in underlying market interest rates. See Note E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information about the Companys long term debt and interest expense. Other expenses. Other expenses were $21.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to $39.6 million during 2002 and $43.3 million during 2001. See Note O of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a detail of the components included in other expenses. Income tax provisions (benefits). The Company recognized a consolidated income tax benefit of $64.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2003 and consolidated income tax provisions of $5.1 million and $4.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Companys consolidated tax benefit in 2003 was comprised of a $.1 million current United States federal tax provision, an $11.1 million current foreign income tax provision, $76.3 million of deferred United States federal and state tax benefits and $.7 million of deferred foreign tax provisions. The 2003 deferred United States federal and state tax benefits include a $197.7 million benefit from the reversal of the Companys valuation allowances against United States deferred tax assets, of which $104.7 million was reversed in the third quarter of 2003. As a result of the reversal of the valuation allowances against the Companys United States deferred tax assets, the effective tax rate on the Companys future earnings in the United States will approximate statutory rates. 36 The Companys consolidated tax provision for 2002 was comprised of current United States state and local taxes of $.2 million, current foreign taxes of $2.1 million and deferred foreign tax provisions of $2.8 million. The Companys consolidated tax provision for 2001 was comprised of current U.S. state and local taxes of $1.1 million, current foreign taxes of $10.5 million and deferred foreign tax benefits of $7.6 million. See "Critical Accounting Estimates" above and Note P of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys tax position. Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. As previously discussed, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 143 on January 1, 2003 and recognized a $15.4 million benefit from the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of $1.3 million of associated Argentine deferred income taxes during the year ended December 31, 2003. On January 1, 2003, the Company also adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections" ("SFAS 145"), the provisions of which did not result in a cumulative effect adjustment. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 145, the Company reclassified to other expense extraordinary losses from the early extinguishment of debt of $22.3 million and $3.8 million realized during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. See Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys adoption of SFAS 143 and SFAS 145. Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity Capital commitments. The Companys primary needs for cash are for exploration, development and acquisitions of oil and gas properties, repayment of contractual obligations and working capital funding. Funding for exploration, development and acquisitions of oil and gas properties and repayment of contractual obligations may be provided by any combination of internally generated cash flow, proceeds from the disposition of non strategic assets or alternative financing sources as discussed in "Capital resources" below. Funding for the Companys working capital obligations is provided by internally generated cash flows. Oil and gas properties. The Companys cash expenditures for additions to oil and gas properties during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 totaled $688.1 million, $614.7 million and $529.7 million, respectively. The Companys 2003 expenditures for additions to oil and gas properties were internally funded by $763.7 million of net cash provided by operating activities. The Companys 2002 expenditures for additions to oil and gas properties were funded by $332.2 million of net cash provided by operating activities, $118.9 million of proceeds from the disposition of assets and a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of 11.5 million shares of the Companys common stock during April 2002. The Companys 2001 expenditures were internally funded by $475.6 million of net cash provided by operating activities and a portion of the Companys $113.5 million of proceeds from disposition of assets. The Company strives to maintain its indebtedness at reasonable levels in order to provide sufficient financial flexibility to take advantage of future opportunities. The Companys capital budget for 2004 is expected to range from $550 million to $600 million. The Company believes that net cash provided by operating activities during 2004 will be sufficient to fund the 2004 capital expenditures budget as well as reduce long term debt by a minimum of $100 million and fund the recently approved plan to begin an annual dividend program of $.20 per common share beginning in 2004. For additional information regarding the Companys plans for 2004, see "2004 Outlook" above. Contractual obligations, including off balance sheet obligations. The Companys contractual obligations include long term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments, derivative obligations and other liabilities. From time to time, the Company enters into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off balance sheet obligations of the Company. As of December 31, 2003, the material off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that the Company has entered into include (i) $47.6 million of undrawn letters of credit, (ii) operating lease agreements, (iii) drilling commitments and (iv) contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable such as derivative contracts that are 37 sensitive to future changes in commodity prices and gas transportation commitments. See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for a table of changes in the fair value of the Companys derivative contract assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2003 and Note I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding future minimum lease payments and gas transportation commitments. The following table summarizes by period the Companys payments due for contractual obligations estimated as of December 31, 2003: Payments Due by Year 2005 and 2007 and 2004 2006 2008 Thereafter (in thousands) Long term debt (a).................. $ $ 135,239 $ 669,750 $ 750,472 Operating leases (b)................ 35,515 81,669 44,950 24,174 Drilling commitments (c)............ 13,601 6,902 602 Derivative obligations (d).......... 161,574 41,640 7,185 Other liabilities (e)............... 38,798 36,201 32,790 76,650 $ 249,488 $ 301,651 $ 755,277 $ 851,296 (a) See Note E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data". (b) See Note I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data". (c) Drilling commitments represent future minimum expenditure commitments under contracts that the Company was a party to on December 31, 2003 for drilling rig services and well commitments. (d) Derivative obligations represent net liabilities for oil and gas commodity derivatives that were valued as of December 31, 2003. These liabilities include $8.8 million of current liabilities that are fixed in amount and are not subject to continuing market risk. The ultimate settlement amounts of the remaining portions of the Companys derivative obligations are unknown because they are subject to continuing market risk. See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys derivative obligations. (e) The Companys other liabilities represent current and noncurrent other liabilities that are comprised of benefit obligations, litigation contingencies, asset retirement obligations and other obligations for which neither the ultimate settlement amounts nor their timings can be precisely determined in advance. See Notes G, I and L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys benefit obligations, litigation contingencies and asset retirement obligations. Capital resources. The Companys primary capital resources are net cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from financing activities and proceeds from sales of non strategic assets. The Company expects that these resources will be sufficient to fund its capital commitments in 2004. Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $763.7 million, $332.2 million and $475.6 million, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 increased by $431.5 million, or 130 percent, as compared to that of 2002. The increase in 2003 was primarily due to increased production volumes and higher commodity prices as compared to 2002. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2002 decreased by $143.4 million, or 30 percent, as compared to that of 2001. The decrease in 2002 net cash provided by operating activities was principally due to declines in commodity prices, offset partially by declines in interest expense. Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001were $662.3 million, $508.1 million and $422.7 million. The $154.2 million increase in cash used in investing activities during 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to a $73.4 million increase in additions to oil and gas properties and an $83.2 million decrease in proceeds from disposition of assets. The cash proceeds from asset divestitures during 2003 were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness. The cash proceeds from asset divestitures during 2002 and 2001 were used to fund a portion of the Companys 2002 and 2001 capital expenditures and for general corporate obligations. See "Results of Operations", above, and Note N of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding asset divestitures. 38 Financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $91.7 million and $64.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2001. During the year ended December 31, 2002, financing activities provided $170.9 million of net cash. During 2003, financing activities were comprised of $105.5 million of net principle payments on long term debt, $14.1 million of payments of other noncurrent liabilities, $2.8 million of loan fees and $2.3 million of treasury stock purchases, partially offset by $33.0 million of proceeds from the exercise of long term incentive plan stock options and employee stock purchases. During 2002, the Companys financing activities were comprised of $236.0 million of proceeds, net of issuance costs, from the sale of 11.5 million shares of the Companys common stock; $48.0 million of net borrowings of long term debt; and $14.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of long term incentive plan stock options and employee stock purchases, partially offset by $124.2 million of payments of other noncurrent liabilities and $3.3 million of debt issuance costs. During 2001, the Companys financing activities were comprised of $5.1 million to repay long term debt, $53.4 million to repay other noncurrent liabilities and $13.0 million to purchase treasury stock, partially offset by $7.5 million of net cash provided from the exercise of long term incentive plan stock options and employee stock purchases. Over the three year period ended December 31, 2003, the Company has entered into financing transactions with the intent of reducing its cost of capital and increasing liquidity through the extension of debt maturities. See Notes E and J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data" and "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for more information about the Companys debt instruments and interest rate hedging activities. The Companys future debt level is dependent primarily on net cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from financing activities and proceeds generated from asset dispositions. The Company believes it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet any unanticipated cash requirements, and during low commodity price periods, the Company has the flexibility to increase borrowings and or modify its capital spending to meet its contractual obligations and maintain its debt ratings. As the Company pursues its strategy, it may utilize various financing sources, including fixed and floating rate debt, convertible securities, preferred stock or common stock. The Company may also issue securities in exchange for oil and gas properties, stock or other interests in other oil and gas companies or related assets. Additional securities may be of a class preferred to common stock with respect to such matters as dividends and liquidation rights and may also have other rights and preferences as determined by the Companys Board of Directors. Liquidity. The Companys principal source of short term liquidity is its revolving credit facility. During December 2003, the Company entered into a new five year revolving credit agreement (the "New Credit Facility") that matures in December 2008. The New Credit Facility replaced the Companys $575 million revolving credit facility (the "Prior Credit Facility") that had a scheduled maturity in March 2005. The terms of the New Credit Facility provide for initial aggregate loan commitments of $700 million from a syndication of participating banks (the "Lenders"). Aggregate loan commitments under the New Credit Facility may be increased to a maximum aggregate amount of $1 billion if the Lenders increase their loan commitments or loan commitments of new financial institutions are added to the New Credit Facility. Outstanding borrowings under the New Credit Facility totaled $160 million as of December 31, 2003. Including $28.8 million of undrawn and outstanding letters of credit under the New Credit Facility, the Company has $511.2 million of unused borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2003. Book capitalization and current ratio. The Companys book capitalization at December 31, 2003 was $3.3 billion, consisting of debt of $1.6 billion and stockholders equity of $1.7 billion. The Companys debt to book capitalization was 46.9 percent at December 31, 2003 as compared to 54.8 percent at December 31, 2002. The Companys ratio of current assets to current liabilities was .48 at December 31, 2003 and .54 at December 31, 2002. The decline in the Companys ratio of current assets to current liabilities was primarily due to increases in current hedge derivative obligations and trade payables. As more fully discussed in "2004 Outlook" above, the Company has targeted a range for debt to book capitalization of between 37 percent and 43 percent. 39 New Accounting Development In its recent review of registrants filings, the staff of the SEC has taken the position that Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"), requires oil and gas entities to separately report on their balance sheets the costs of leasehold mineral interests, including related accumulated depletion, as intangible assets and provide related disclosures. The Company has historically included producing leasehold costs in the proved properties caption on its balance sheet since the value of the leases is inseparable from the value of the related oil and gas reserves. This classification is consistent with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 19, "Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies", and standard industry practice. Almost all costs included in the unproved properties caption on the balance sheet are leasehold mineral interests that are regularly evaluated for impairment based on lease term and drilling activity. The SEC staff has referred the question of SFAS 142 applicability for consideration by the Emerging Issues Task Force. If the provisions of SFAS 142 are determined to be applicable to oil and gas leasehold mineral interests, reclassifications within property, plant and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and additional disclosures may be required. As of December 31, 2003, the Company has not determined the amount of such reclassifications, if applicable. The Company does not believe that the provisions of SFAS 142, if determined to be applicable, will have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following quantitative and qualitative information is provided about financial instruments to which the Company was a party as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and from which the Company may incur future gains or losses from changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. Although certain derivative contracts that the Company is a party to do not qualify as hedges, the Company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading purposes. The fair value of the Companys derivative contracts are determined based on counterparties estimates and valuation models. The Company did not change its valuation method during the year ended December 31, 2003. During 2003, the Company was a party to forward foreign exchange contracts, commodity and interest rate swap contracts and commodity collar contracts. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys derivative contracts, including deferred gains and losses on terminated derivative contracts. The following table reconciles the changes that occurred in the fair values of the Companys open derivative contracts during 2003: Derivative Contract Assets (Liabilities) Foreign Interest Exchange Commodity Rate Rate Total (in thousands) Fair value of contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2002.............. $ (108,804) $ $ 15 $(108,789) Changes in contract fair values (a)......

Quantitative Disclosures Interest rate sensitivity. The following tables provide information about other financial instruments that the Company was a party to as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 and that are or were sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the tables present maturities by expected maturity dates, the weighted average interest rates expected to be paid on the debt given current 40 contractual terms and market conditions and the debts estimated fair value. For fixed rate debt, the weighted average interest rate represents the contractual fixed rates that the Company was obligated to periodically pay on the debt as of December 31, 2003 and 2002.
