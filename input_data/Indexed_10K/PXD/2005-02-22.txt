ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2004 Highlights and Events Pioneers financial and operating performance for the year ended December 31, 2004 included the following highlights and events: o Average daily sales volumes on a BOE basis increased 21 percent in 2004 as compared to 2003, principally due to a full year of production from the Falcon and Sable development projects, new production being initiated from the Harrier, Raptor and Tomahawk fields in the Falcon area and at Devils Tower and fourth quarter production added from the Evergreen merger. o Oil and gas revenues increased 44 percent in 2004 as a result of the increased production volumes and increases in worldwide oil and gas prices. o Income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle increased by 45 percent to $479.2 million from $330.8 million in 2003. o Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 45 percent to a record $1.1 billion as compared to $763.7 million in 2003. o The Companys capital investment programs resulted in total proved reserves of 1.0 billion BOE at December 31, 2004. o The declaration of $.20 per share of common dividends. o A $39.7 million impairment charge ($12.8 million net of tax benefits) as a result of the decision to cancel Gabonese Olowi field development plans. See Note T of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for more information pertaining to this matter. o Partial loss of third and fourth quarter production at Devils Tower and Canyon Express from Hurricane Ivan which struck on September 15, 2004 and related damages. o The 2004 repurchase of 2.8 million shares of the Companys common stock for $92 million. During 2004, the Company also announced the following financial and operating achievements: o Rating agencies upgrade of the Company to investment grade status in response to improved financial position and earnings trends, along with other factors specific to the Company. o Merger with Evergreen. See Note C of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" and "Evergreen Merger" below for information regarding this business combination. o The exchange of portions of the Companys higher yielding senior notes for 5.875% senior notes due 2016 (the "New Notes") and cash. See Note F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" and "Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity" below for information regarding this $526.8 million debt exchange that was completed in July 2004. o Completion of the first amendment (the "First Amendment") to the Companys $700 million, five year revolving credit agreement (the "Revolving Credit Agreement") which removed Pioneer Natural Resources USA, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("Pioneer USA"), as a guarantor of the Revolving Credit Agreement and had the effect of removing Pioneer USA as a guarantor of the Companys senior notes. See Note F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for information regarding the First Amendment. o Completion of a successful appraisal well in the Hawa area in the Adam production concession onshore southern Tunisia. o First production from the Companys deepwater Gulf of Mexico Harrier field during January 2004, the Devils Tower field during May 2004 and the Raptor and Tomahawk fields during June 2004. o The acquisition of a 50 percent interest in Block H offshore Equatorial Guinea, West Africa. o The announced agreement to participate in a joint exploration program with ConocoPhillips and Anadarko Petroleum Corporation in the National Petroleum Reserve on the North Slope of Alaska. 29 2004 Financial and Operating Performance During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded net income of $312.9 million, $410.6 million and $26.7 million ($2.46, $3.46 and $.23 per diluted share), respectively. Compared to 2003, the Companys 2004 total revenues and other income increased by $559.4 million, or 43 percent, including a $558.8 million increase in oil and gas revenues. The increase in oil and gas revenues was due to increases in production volumes and increases of 23 percent, 32 percent and 13 percent in average oil, NGL and gas prices, respectively, including the effects of commodity price hedges. Compared to 2003, the Companys total costs and expenses increased by $410.9 million, or 43 percent, during the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in total costs and expenses was primarily reflective of a $184.0 million increase in depletion, depreciation and amortization ("DD&A") expense, primarily driven by increases in depletion associated with increased production volumes from higher cost basis deepwater Gulf of Mexico and South Africa properties, a $90.8 million increase in oil and gas production costs, which primarily resulted from increases in production volumes, the strengthening of both the Argentine peso and Canadian dollar and commodity prices that impacted variable lease operating expenses and production taxes, a $48.9 million increase in exploration and abandonments expense primarily due to increased exploration/extension drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, Argentina, Canada and Gabon and a $39.7 million impairment charge on the Companys Gabonese properties. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Companys net cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.1 billion, as compared to $763.7 million during 2003 and $332.2 million during 2002. The 45 percent increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2004 was primarily due to increases in production volumes and commodity prices, as discussed above. During the year ended December 31, 2004, successful capital investment activities increased the Companys proved reserves to 1.0 billion BOE, reflecting the effects of the Evergreen merger, strategic acquisitions of property interests in the Companys core operating areas and the Companys 2004 drilling program. Costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2004 totaled $3.2 billion, including $2.6 billion of proved and unproved property acquisitions, $557.2 million of exploration and development drilling and seismic expenditures and $15.1 million of asset retirement obligations. Costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2004 include $2.5 billion of costs to acquire Evergreens oil and gas properties. See "Results of Operations" and "Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity", below, for more in depth discussions of the Companys oil and gas producing activities, including discussions pertaining to oil and gas production volumes, prices, hedging activities, costs and expenses, capital commitments, capital resources and liquidity. Evergreen Merger On September 28, 2004, Pioneer completed its merger with Evergreen. Pioneer acquired the common stock of Evergreen for a total purchase price of approximately $1.8 billion, which was comprised of cash and Pioneer common stock. At the merger date, Evergreens proved reserves were approximately 262.2 MMBOE. Evergreen was a publicly traded independent oil and gas company primarily engaged in the production, development, exploration and acquisition of North American unconventional gas. Evergreen was based in Denver, Colorado and was one of the leading developers of CBM reserves in the United States. Evergreens operations were principally focused on developing and expanding its CBM gas field located in the Raton Basin in southern Colorado. Evergreen also had operations in the Piceance Basin in western Colorado, the Uinta Basin in eastern Utah and the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin. See Note C of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for more information regarding the Evergreen merger. 2005 Outlook and Activities Volumetric production payments. During January 2005, the Company sold two percent of its total proved reserves, or 20.5 million BOE of proved reserves, by means of two volumetric production payments ("VPPs") for total proceeds of $593 million and the assumption of the Companys obligations under certain derivative hedge agreements. Proceeds from the VPPs were initially used to pay down indebtedness. 30 The VPPs represent limited term overriding royalty interests in oil and gas reserves which: (i) entitle the purchaser to receive production volumes over a period of time from specific lease interests; (ii) are free and clear of all associated future production costs and capital expenditures; (iii) are nonrecourse to the Company (i.e., the purchasers only recourse is to the assets acquired); (iv) transfers title to the purchaser and (v) allows the Company to retain the assets after the VPPs volumetric obligations have been satisfied. The first VPP sells 58 Bcf of Hugoton field gas volumes over an expected five year term beginning in February 2005 for $275 million of proceeds. The second VPP sells 10.8 MMBOE of Spraberry field oil volumes over an expected seven year term beginning in January 2006 for $318 million of proceeds. A VPP is considered a sale of proved reserves and the related future production of those proved reserves. As a result the Company will (i) remove the proved reserves associated with the VPPs; (ii) recognize the VPP proceeds as deferred revenue which will be amortized on a unit of production basis to future oil and gas revenues over the terms of the VPPs; (iii) retain responsibility for 100 percent of the production costs and capital costs related to VPP interests and (iv) no longer recognize production associated with the VPP volumes, resulting in higher future revenue per BOE, production costs per BOE and DD&A per BOE ratios. The Company will amortize to oil and gas revenues $62.9 million of net deferred gas revenue during 2005 associated with the Hugoton field VPP. During 2006, the Company will amortize $57.6 million of net deferred gas revenue associated with the Hugoton field VPP and $53.7 million of net deferred oil revenue associated with the Spraberry field VPP. Commodity prices. World oil prices increased during the year ended December 31, 2004 in response to political unrest and supply disruptions in Iraq and Venezuela as well as other supply and demand factors. North American gas prices also increased during 2004 in response to continued strong supply and demand fundamentals. The Companys outlook for 2005 commodity prices continues to be cautiously optimistic. Significant factors that will impact 2005 commodity prices include developments in Iraq and other Middle East countries, the extent to which members of the OPEC and other oil exporting nations are able to manage oil supply through export quotas and variations in key North American gas supply and demand indicators. Pioneer will continue to strategically hedge oil and gas price risk to mitigate the impact of price volatility on its oil, NGL and gas revenues. See Note K of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys commodity hedge positions at December 31, 2004. Also see "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for disclosures about the Companys commodity related derivative financial instruments. Capital expenditures. During 2005, the Companys budget for oil and gas capital activities is expected to range from $900 million to $950 million, of which approximately 75 percent has been budgeted for lower risk development and extension drilling and facility costs and 25 percent for exploration expenditures. The Companys 2005 capital budget is allocated approximately 75 percent to the United States, 15 percent to Argentina and five percent to each of Africa and Canada. Pioneer expects to drill approximately 800 exploration and development wells during 2005. During 2005 and 2006, the Company expects to expend approximately $394 million and $348 million, respectively, of capital for development drilling and facility costs related to its proved undeveloped reserves. Production growth. The Company expects that its annual 2005 worldwide production will range from 70 MMBOE to 74 MMBOE, or approximately 192 MBOE to 203 MBOE per day. The forecasted range includes a full year of production from the assets acquired in the Evergreen merger and has been reduced by the VPP volumes sold during January 2005. The Company expects, based on quoted futures prices, to generate cash flow significantly in excess of its capital program which will further enhance the Companys financial flexibility to fund the development of future exploration successes, core area acquisitions and additional development drilling. With several discoveries in various stages of commercialization, a pipeline of exploration opportunities, the potential for continued core area acquisitions, continuing strong commodity prices and significant excess cash flow, Pioneer has targeted five year average compounded annual production growth of eight percent to nine percent or ten percent per share, giving consideration to contemplated share repurchases. 31 Costs and expenses. The Company expects that its costs and expenses that are highly correlated with production volumes, such as production costs and depletion expense, will increase in absolute amounts during 2005 and that production costs, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and other costs and expenses will increase on a per BOE basis as a result of the sale of proved reserves through the VPPs. Additionally, the Company expects that depletion expense will increase on a per BOE basis during 2005 as compared to 2004 due to increased production from the Devils Tower oil field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the assets acquired in the Evergreen merger. The per BOE cost basis of these fields is higher than that of Pioneers average producing property in 2004. Ad valorem taxes are highly correlated with prior year commodity prices. As a consequence of increases in oil, NGL and gas prices during 2004, ad valorem taxes are expected to be higher in 2005, as compared to 2004. The Company also anticipates an increase in general and administrative expenses during 2005 due to additional staffing associated with the Evergreen merger and anticipated Company growth, as well as the amortization of deferred compensation associated with unvested restricted stock and stock options. Capital allocation. During 2004, the Company improved its financial position and achieved investment grade standards. The Company is now targeting mid investment grade ratings. Towards that end, the Company established a targeted range for debt to book capitalization of less than 35 percent by the end of 2005, as further discussed later. During 2004, the Company paid dividends of $.20 per common share in two semiannual installments of $.10 per common share, and the Company currently expects to, as a minimum, maintain this level of dividends in 2005. During 2005 through 2007, the Company anticipates, based upon year end futures prices, that it will have significant excess cash flow after funding its typical annual capital budgets, planned dividends and achieving its leverage targets. The Company considers it a high priority to utilize a portion of the excess cash flow to fund the development of new exploration successes and to selectively acquire additional assets in its core areas. The Company will also use a portion of the excess cash flow for share repurchases, pursuant to the recently approved $300 million stock repurchase program. First quarter 2005. Based on current estimates, the Company expects that first quarter 2005 production will average 175,000 to 190,000 BOE per day. This range is lower than the fourth quarter average reflecting the VPP volumes sold, more days of downtime and a gradual ramp up of production for the Canyon Express system which has been undergoing repairs, the timing of oil cargo shipments in Tunisia and South Africa which were high during the fourth quarter, and the typical seasonal decline in gas demand during Argentinas summer season. First quarter production costs (including production and ad valorem taxes) are expected to average $6.00 to $6.50 per BOE based on current NYMEX strip prices for oil and gas. The increase over the prior quarter is a result of the retention of operating costs related to the VPP volumes sold, an increase in production and ad valorem taxes and additional workovers planned during the Canadian winter access season. Production costs are expected to decline in the second quarter of 2005 as lower cost volumes resume from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and workovers return to more normal levels. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense is expected to average $8.75 to $9.25 per BOE. Total exploration and abandonment expense is expected to be $80 million to $110 million. Several higher risk exploration wells and significant seismic investments are planned during the first quarter, serving to front end load the Companys 2005 exploration program. Specifically, first quarter exploration activity is expected to include an appraisal well to the 2004 Thunder Hawk discovery and an exploration well on a Falcon Corridor satellite prospect in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In Alaska, as many as three wells are expected to test new exploration targets and Pioneer plans to shoot seismic over newly acquired acreage. One well is planned in West Africa and lower risk exploration and geologic and geophysical work will also continue in Argentina, Canada and Tunisia. General and administrative expense is expected to be $24 million to $26 million. Interest expense is expected to be $33 million to $36 million, and accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations is expected to be approximately $2 million to $3 million. The Companys effective income tax rate is expected to range from 36 percent to 39 percent based on current capital spending plans, including cash income taxes of $5 million to $10 million that are principally related to Argentine and Tunisian income taxes and nominal alternative minimum tax in the U.S. Other than in Argentina and Tunisia, the Company continues to benefit from the carryforward of net operating losses and other positive tax attributes. 32 Debt reduction target. Although the Evergreen merger has resulted in an increase in the Companys ratio of debt to book capitalization, the Company has targeted a ratio of debt to book capitalization of less than 35 percent by the end of 2005. To achieve this target, the Company plans to apply a portion of the proceeds from the 2005 VPPs and the divestiture of certain Canadian assets for expected proceeds of over $100 million to reduce debt. In addition, the Company expects cash flows to be significantly in excess of the 2005 capital program based on current commodity prices which can be used to further reduce debt. Field Fuel Reporting During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company completed a voluntary internal review of the various accounting treatments related to field fuel costs used by major oil companies and other independents in order to determine common industry practice. The review, in part, was undertaken in response to the large volume of field fuel usage related to the assets acquired from Evergreen. Field fuel is gas consumed to operate field equipment (primarily compressors) prior to the gas being delivered to a sales point. Pioneer has historically recorded the value of field fuel as an operating expense with an equal amount recorded as oil and gas revenues, with no net income effect. Pioneer also reflected the volumes associated with field fuel in gas production. This practice has been routinely discussed by the Company, especially in relation to the rising value of the fuel used in the field and its contribution to rising field operating expenses. Although the Company believes that its past treatment of field fuel was acceptable, the Company changed its reporting of field fuel, no longer recording it as revenue or expense and not including it as production. Pioneer believes this presentation is more common in the industry and will provide a better basis for comparing Pioneer to other oil and gas companies. Within this Report, the Company has adjusted its prior period revenues, production costs and sales volumes to reflect the new method of reporting field fuel. The change in reporting field fuel did not change reported net income of the periods presented since revenues and production costs were changed in equal amounts. Critical Accounting Estimates The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements for inclusion in this Report in accordance with GAAP. See Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a comprehensive discussion of the Companys significant accounting policies. GAAP represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements, the application of which requires management judgments and estimates including, in certain circumstances, choices between acceptable GAAP alternatives. Following is a discussion of the Companys most critical accounting estimates, judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the Companys application of GAAP. Accounting for oil and gas producing activities. The accounting for and disclosure of oil and gas producing activities requires the Companys management to choose between GAAP alternatives and to make judgments about estimates of future uncertainties. Successful efforts method of accounting. The Company utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities as opposed to the alternate acceptable full cost method. In general, the Company believes that, during periods of active exploration, net assets and net income are more conservatively measured under the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities than under the full cost method. The critical difference between the successful efforts method of accounting and the full cost method is as follows: under the successful efforts method, exploratory dry holes and geological and geophysical exploration costs are charged against earnings during the periods in which they occur; whereas, under the full cost method of accounting, such costs and expenses are capitalized as assets, pooled with the costs of successful wells and charged against the earnings of future periods as a component of depletion expense. During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company recognized exploration, abandonment, geological and geophysical expense of $181.7 million, $132.8 million and $85.9 million, respectively, under the successful efforts method. Proved reserve estimates. Estimates of the Companys proved reserves included in this Report are prepared in accordance with GAAP and SEC guidelines. The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of: 33 o the quality and quantity of available data, o the interpretation of that data, o the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and o the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate. The Companys proved reserve information included in this Report as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was audited by independent petroleum engineers with respect to the Companys major properties and prepared by the Companys engineers with respect to all other properties. Estimates prepared by third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein. Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, all of which may substantially differ from future actual results, reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify, positively or negatively, material revisions to the estimate of proved reserves. It should not be assumed that the present value of future net cash flows included in this Report as of December 31, 2004 is the current market value of the Companys estimated proved reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the Company based the estimated present value of future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. The Companys estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion expense. If the estimates of proved reserves decline, the rate at which the Company records depletion expense will increase, reducing future net income. Such a decline may result from lower market prices, which may make it uneconomical to drill for and produce higher cost fields. In addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of the Companys assessment of its oil and gas producing properties and goodwill for impairment. Impairment of proved oil and gas properties. The Company reviews its long lived proved properties to be held and used whenever management determines that events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable. Management assesses whether or not an impairment provision is necessary based upon its outlook of future commodity prices and net cash flows that may be generated by the properties and if a significant downward revision has occurred to the estimated proved reserves. Proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment at the level at which depletion of proved properties is calculated. Impairment of unproved oil and gas properties. Management periodically assesses unproved oil and gas properties for impairment, on a project by project basis. Managements assessment of the results of exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects impact the amount and timing of impairment provisions, if any. Suspended wells. The Company suspends the costs of exploratory wells that discover hydrocarbons pending a final determination of the commercial potential of the oil and gas discovery. The ultimate disposition of these well costs is dependent on the results of future drilling activity and development decisions. If the Company decides not to pursue additional appraisal activities or development of these fields, the costs of these wells will be charged to exploration and abandonment expense. The Company generally does not carry the costs of drilling an exploratory well as an asset in its Consolidated Balance Sheets for more than one year following the completion of drilling unless the exploratory well finds oil and gas reserves in an area requiring a major capital expenditure and both of the following conditions are met: (i) The well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well if the required capital expenditure is made. (ii) Drilling of the additional exploratory wells is under way or firmly planned for the near future. Due to the capital intensive nature and the geographical location of certain Alaskan, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and foreign projects, it may take the Company longer than one year to evaluate the future potential of the exploration well 34 and economics associated with making a determination on its commercial viability. In these instances, the projects feasibility is not contingent upon price improvements or advances in technology, but rather the Companys ongoing efforts and expenditures related to accurately predicting the hydrocarbon recoverability based on well information, gaining access to other companies production, transportation or processing facilities and or getting partner approval to drill additional appraisal wells. These activities are ongoing and being pursued constantly. Consequently, the Companys assessment of suspended exploratory well costs is continuous until a decision can be made that the well has found proved reserves or is noncommercial and is impaired. See Note D of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys suspended exploratory well costs. Assessments of functional currencies. Management determines the functional currencies of the Companys subsidiaries based on an assessment of the currency of the economic environment in which a subsidiary primarily realizes and expends its operating revenues, costs and expenses. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of all of the Companys international operations except Canada. The assessment of functional currencies can have a significant impact on periodic results of operations and financial position. Argentine economic and currency measures. The accounting for and remeasurement of the Companys Argentine balance sheets as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 reflect managements assumptions regarding some uncertainties unique to Argentinas current economic situation. The Argentine economic and political situation continues to evolve and the Argentine government may enact future regulations or policies that, when finalized and adopted, may materially impact, among other items, (i) the realized prices the Company receives for the commodities it produces and sells; (ii) the timing of repatriations of excess cash flow to the Companys corporate headquarters in the United States; (iii) the Companys asset valuations; and (iv) peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities. See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a description of the assumptions utilized in the preparation of these financial statements. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances. The Company continually assesses both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be realized prior to their expiration. Pioneer monitors Company specific, oil and gas industry and worldwide economic factors and reassesses the likelihood that the Companys net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax attributes in each jurisdiction will be utilized prior to their expiration. There can be no assurances that facts and circumstances will not materially change and require the Company to establish a United States deferred tax asset valuation allowance in a future period. As of December 31, 2004, the Company does not believe there is sufficient positive evidence to reverse its valuation allowances related to foreign tax jurisdictions. Goodwill impairment. The Company will review its goodwill for impairment at least annually. This requires the Company to estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting units that have goodwill. There is considerable judgment involved in estimating fair values, particularly proved reserve estimates as described above. Litigation and environmental contingencies. The Company makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for ongoing litigation and environmental remediation. Actual costs can vary from such estimates for a variety of reasons. The costs to settle litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws and opinions and assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, environmental remediation liabilities are subject to change because of changes in laws, regulations, additional information obtained relating to the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology. Under GAAP, a liability is recorded for these types of contingencies if the Company determines the loss to be both probable and reasonably estimated. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys commitments and contingencies. Results of Operations Oil and gas revenues. Revenues from oil and gas operations totaled $1.8 billion during 2004, as compared to $1.3 billion during 2003 and $694.4 million during 2002, representing a 44 percent increase from 2003 to 2004. The revenue increase from 2003 to 2004 was due to a 21 percent increase in total BOE production, a 23 percent increase in oil prices, a 32 percent increase in NGL 35 prices and a 13 percent increase in gas prices, including the effects of commodity price hedges. The revenue increase from 2002 to 2003 was due to a 37 percent increase in BOE production, a 12 percent increase in oil prices, a 40 percent increase in NGL prices and a 49 percent increase in gas prices, including the effects of commodity price hedges. The following table provides average daily sales volumes, by geographic area and in total, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: Year ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Average daily sales volumes: Oil (Bbls) United States................................. 26,637 24,525 23,437 Argentina..................................... 8,534 8,687 7,984 Canada........................................ 137 111 124 Africa........................................ 11,676 1,981 Worldwide..................................... 46,984 35,304 31,545 NGLs (Bbls) United States................................. 19,738 20,338 20,512 Argentina..................................... 1,546 1,318 696 Canada........................................ 917 906 946 Worldwide..................................... 22,201 22,562 22,154 Gas (Mcf) United States................................. 521,839 423,013 211,502 Argentina..................................... 121,654 94,128 78,220 Canada........................................ 41,867 41,669 48,365 Worldwide..................................... 685,360 558,810 338,087 Total (BOE) United States................................. 133,349 115,364 79,201 Argentina..................................... 30,356 25,694 21,716 Canada........................................ 8,031 7,962 9,131 Africa........................................ 11,676 1,981 Worldwide..................................... 183,412 151,001 110,048 Per BOE average daily production for 2004 as compared to 2003 increased by 16 percent in the United States, by 18 percent in Argentina, by one percent in Canada and the Company realized first production from South Africa and Tunisia during 2003. The increased production was principally attributable to a full year of production from the Falcon area, new production being initiated from the Harrier, Raptor and Tomahawk fields in the Falcon area and at Devils Tower, fourth quarter production added from the Evergreen merger and to oil sales having first been realized from the Companys Tunisian and South African oil projects during August and October of 2003, respectively. Argentine oil and gas sales volumes increased during 2004 primarily due to production volumes being added from the Companys capital expenditures and higher oil and gas demand during their summer season. Per BOE average daily production for 2003 as compared to 2002 increased by 46 percent in the United States, by 18 percent in Argentina and the Company realized first production from South Africa and Tunisia during 2003, while average daily production for 2003 as compared to 2002 decreased by 13 percent in Canada due to normal production decline rates. The increased production was principally attributable to incremental gas production from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico Canyon Express and Falcon area projects, initial oil production in South Africa and Tunisia and increased oil and gas production in Argentina, offset by normal production declines. 36 The following table provides average reported prices, including the results of hedging activities, and average realized prices, excluding the results of hedging activities, by geographic area and in total, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: Year ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 > Average reported prices: Oil (per Bbl) United States............................. $ 29.41 $ 25.25 $ 23.66 Argentina................................. $ 28.06 $ 25.62 $ 20.63 Canada.................................... $ 44.83 $ 29.10 $ 22.26 Africa.................................... $ 38.12 $ 29.52 $ Worldwide................................. $ 31.38 $ 25.59 $ 22.89 NGL (per Bbl) United States............................. $ 25.07 $ 19.04 $ 13.77 Argentina................................. $ 29.91 $ 22.85 $ 14.56 Canada.................................... $ 30.87 $ 24.80 $ 16.77 Worldwide................................. $ 25.65 $ 19.50 $ 13.92 Gas (per Mcf) United States............................. $ 5.15 $ 4.47 $ 3.16 Argentina................................. $ .66 $ .56 $ .48 Canada.................................... $ 4.64 $ 4.93 $ 3.41 Worldwide................................. $ 4.33 $ 3.84 $ 2.58 Average realized prices: Oil (per Bbl) United States............................. $ 39.59 $ 29.58 $ 23.85 Argentina................................. $ 29.82 $ 26.31 $ 20.33 Canada.................................... $ 44.83 $ 29.10 $ 22.26 Africa.................................... $ 38.71 $ 30.07 $ Worldwide................................. $ 37.61 $ 28.80 $ 22.95 NGL (per Bbl) United States............................. $ 25.07 $ 19.04 $ 13.77 Argentina................................. $ 29.91 $ 22.85 $ 14.56 Canada.................................... $ 30.87 $ 24.80 $ 16.77 Worldwide................................. $ 25.65 $ 19.50 $ 13.92 Gas (per Mcf) United States............................. $ 5.72 $ 4.92 $ 3.01 Argentina................................. $ .66 $ .56 $ .48 Canada.................................... $ 5.75 $ 5.30 $ 3.32 Worldwide................................. $ 4.83 $ 4.25 $ 2.52 Field fuel. As previously discussed, the Company changed its method of reporting field fuel usage during the fourth quarter of 2004. Accordingly, the gas revenues, production volumes and related per unit measures of all periods presented have been adjusted in accordance with the new method of reporting field fuel. Hedging activities. The oil and gas prices that the Company reports are based on the market price received for the commodities adjusted by the results of the Companys cash flow hedging activities. The Company utilizes commodity swap and collar contracts in order to (i) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities the Company produces and sells, (ii) support the Companys annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and (iii) reduce commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects. The effective portions of changes in the fair values of the Companys commodity price hedges are deferred as increases or decreases to stockholders equity until the underlying hedged transaction occurs. Consequently, changes in the effective portions of commodity price hedges add volatility to the Companys reported stockholders equity until the hedge derivative matures or is terminated. See Note K of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for information concerning the impact to oil and gas revenues during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 from the Companys hedging activities, the Companys open hedge positions at December 31, 2004 and descriptions of the Companys hedge commodity derivatives. Also see "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for additional disclosures about the Companys commodity related derivative financial instruments. 37 Argentine commodity prices. During 2002, the Argentine government implemented a 20 percent tax on oil exports. During 2002 and 2003, the Company exported approximately 29 percent and five percent, respectively, of its Argentine oil production. Associated therewith, the Company incurred oil export taxes of $2.2 million and $1.2 million for 2002 and 2003, respectively. During 2004, the Company did not export any of its Argentine oil production. The export tax has also had the effect of decreasing internal Argentine oil revenues (not only export revenues) by the taxes levied. The U.S. dollar equivalent value for domestic Argentine oil sales (now paid in pesos) has generally moved toward parity with the U.S. dollar denominated export values, net of the export tax. The adverse impact of this tax has been partially offset by the net cost savings resulting from the devaluation of the peso on peso denominated costs. In January 2003, at the Argentine governments request, oil producers and refiners agreed to cap amounts payable for certain domestic sales at $28.50 per Bbl which remained in effect through April 2004. The producers and refiners further agreed that the difference between the actual price and the capped price would be payable once actual prices fall below the $28.50 cap. Subsequently the terms were modified such that while the $28.50 per Bbl payable cap was in place, the refiners would have no obligation to pay producers for sales values that exceeded $36.00 per Bbl. Initially, the refiners and producers also agreed to discount U.S. dollar denominated oil prices at 90 percent prior to converting to pesos at the current exchange rate for the purpose of invoicing and settling oil sales to Argentine refiners. In May 2004, refiners and producers changed the discount percentage from 90 percent for all price levels to 86 percent if West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") was equal to or less than $36 per Bbl and 80 percent if WTI exceeded $36 per Bbl. All the oil prices are adjusted for normal quality differentials prior to applying the discount. In 2004, it appeared probable that the price of world oil would remain above the $28.50 cap for the foreseeable future. Given the uncertainty surrounding the timing of when Argentine producers could expect to collect balances outstanding from refiners, the Company ceased recognizing revenue and began recording any excess between the actual sales price pursuant to its oil sales contracts with Argentine refiners that were subject to the price stabilization agreement and the $28.50 price cap as deferred revenue in the balance sheet. At December 31, 2004, the Company had $5.0 million of deferred revenue reflected in its balance sheet associated with the sales in excess of the price cap. The decision by Argentine oil producers and refiners to not renew the price stability agreement beyond April 30, 2004 does not terminate the obligation of refiners to reimburse producers for balances that accumulated from January 2003 through April 2004, if and when the price of WTI falls below $28.50. In May 2004, the Argentine government increased the export tax from 20 percent to 25 percent. This tax is applied on the sales value after the tax, thus, the net effect of the 20 percent and 25 percent rates is 16.7 percent and 20 percent, respectively. In August 2004, the Argentine government further increased the export tax rates for oil exports. The export tax now escalates from the current 25 percent (20 percent effective rate) to a maximum rate of 45 percent (31 percent effective rate) of the realized value for exported barrels as WTI prices per barrel increase from less than $32.00 to $45.00 and above. The export tax is not deducted in the calculation of royalty payments and expires in February 2007. Given the number of governmental changes during 2004 affecting the realized price the Company receives for its oil sales, no specific predictions can be made about the future of oil prices in Argentina, however, in the short term, the Company expects Argentine oil realizations to be less than oil realizations in the United States. As a result of economic emergency law enacted by the Argentine government in January 2002, the Companys gas prices, expressed in U.S. dollars, have also fallen in proportion to the devaluation of the Argentine peso since the end of 2001 due to the pesofication of contracts and freezing of gas prices at the wellhead required by that law. As a baseline, the Companys 2001 realized Argentine gas price was $1.31 per Mcf as compared to $.48, $.56 and $.66 in 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. The unfavorable gas price has acted to discourage gas development activities and increased gas demand. Without development of gas reserves in Argentina, supplies of gas in the country have declined, while demand for gas has been increasing due to the resurgence of the Argentine economy and the higher cost of alternative fuels. Recently, gas exports to Chile were curtailed at the direction of the Argentine government and Argentina entered into an agreement to import gas from Bolivia at prices starting at approximately $2.00 per Mcf (at the border), including transportation costs. In May 2004, pursuant to a decree, the Argentine government approved measures to permit producers to renegotiate gas sales contracts, excluding those that could affect small residential customers, in accordance with scheduled price increases specified in the decree. The wellhead prices in the decree rise from a current range of $.61 to $.78 per Mcf to a range of $.87 to $1.04 per Mcf after July 1, 2005, depending on the region where the gas is produced. No further gas price 38 increases beyond July 2005 have been allowed for in the current decree. Other than an expectation that gas prices will be permitted to increase gradually over time, as has already been demonstrated by the governing authorities, no specific predictions can be made about the future of gas prices in Argentina, however, the Company expects Argentine gas realizations to be less than gas realizations in the United States. See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for further discussion of commodity prices in Argentina. Interest and other income. The Company recorded interest and other income totaling $14.1 million, $12.3 million and $11.2 during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Companys interest and other income was comprised of revenue that was not directly attributable to oil and gas producing activities or oil and gas property divestitures. See Note N of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding interest and other income. Gain on disposition of assets. During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company completed asset divestitures for net proceeds of $1.7 million, $35.7 million and $118.9 million, respectively. Associated therewith, the Company recorded gains on disposition of assets of $39 thousand, $1.3 million and $4.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The net cash proceeds from asset divestitures during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were used, together with net cash flows provided by operating activities, to fund additions to oil and gas properties and to reduce outstanding indebtedness. See Note O of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding asset divestitures. Oil and gas production costs. The Company recorded production costs of $345.5 million, $254.8 million and $192.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In general, lease operating expenses and workover expenses represent the components of oil and gas production costs over which the Company has management control, while production taxes and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes. Total production costs per BOE increased during the year ended December 31, 2004 by 11 percent as compared to 2003. The increase in total production costs per BOE during 2004 as compared to 2003 is primarily attributable to increases in production volumes and a greater proportion of those volumes coming from the Sable oil field in South Africa, the Devils Tower oil and gas field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and, to a lesser extent, the new production added with the Evergreen merger which are higher operating cost properties. Total production costs per BOE decreased during 2003 by three percent as compared to 2002, primarily due to decreases in per BOE ad valorem taxes and workover expenses, partially offset by increases in per BOE lease operating expenses and production taxes. The increase in per BOE lease operating expenses was due to the strengthening of both the Argentine peso and the Canadian dollar, Argentine inflation and higher average lifting costs incurred on South African Sable oil field production, while the increase in per BOE production taxes primarily resulted from increases in North American gas prices and world oil prices. The decrease in per BOE ad valorem taxes is primarily due to the incremental production from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Argentina, South Africa and Tunisia fields which are not subject to ad valorem taxes. 39 The following tables provide the components of the Companys total production costs per BOE and total production costs per BOE by geographic area for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Lease operating expenses..................... $ 3.86 $ 3.42 $ 3.40 Taxes: Ad valorem ................................ .42 .41 .56 Production................................. .64 .64 .56 Workover expenses............................ .23 .15 .26 Total production costs................. $ 5.15 $ 4.62 $ 4.78 Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Total production costs: United States.............................. $ 5.11 $ 4.68 $ 5.23 Argentina.................................. $ 2.99 $ 2.78 $ 1.75 Canada..................................... $ 10.64 $ 9.92 $ 8.09 Africa..................................... $ 7.37 $ 3.99 $ Worldwide.................................. $ 5.15 $ 4.62 $ 4.78 As previously discussed, the Company changed its method of reporting field fuel usage during the fourth quarter of 2004. Accordingly, the production costs and related per unit measures of all presented periods have been adjusted in accordance with the new method of reporting field fuel. Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense. The Companys total DD&A expense was $8.56, $7.09 and $5.39 per BOE for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Depletion expense, the largest component of DD&A, was $8.37, $6.92 and $5.17 per BOE during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and depreciation and amortization of other property and equipment was $.19, $.17 and $.22 per BOE during each of the respective years. During 2004 and 2003, the increase in per BOE depletion expense was due to a greater proportion of the Companys production being derived from higher cost basis deepwater Gulf of Mexico and South African developments and downward revisions to proved reserves in Canada in 2003. The following table provides depletion expense per BOE by geographic area for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 > Depletion expense: United States.............................. $ 8.61 $ 7.08 $ 4.85 Argentina.................................. $ 5.56 $ 4.96 $ 5.00 Canada..................................... $ 10.93 $ 9.98 $ 8.36 Africa..................................... $ 11.19 $ 10.69 $ Worldwide.................................. $ 8.37 $ 6.92 $ 5.17 Impairment of oil and gas properties. The Company reviews its long lived assets to be held and used, including oil and gas properties, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recognized a noncash impairment charge of $39.7 million to reduce the carrying value of its Gabonese Olowi field assets as development of the discovery was canceled. See "Critical Accounting Estimates" above and Notes B and T of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information pertaining to the Companys accounting policies regarding assessments of impairment and the Gabonese Olowi field impairment, respectively. 40 Exploration, abandonments, geological and geophysical costs. Exploration, abandonments, geological and geophysical costs totaled $181.7 million, $132.8 million and $85.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The following table provides the Companys geological and geophysical costs, exploratory dry hole expense, lease abandonments and other exploration expense by geographic area for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: Africa United and States Argentina Canada Other Total (in thousands) Year ended December 31, 2004: Geological and geophysical costs.......... $ 51,731 $ 11,718 $ 4,047 $ 14,833 $ 82,329 Exploratory dry holes..................... 39,328 7,213 11,811 24,460 82,812 Leasehold abandonments and other.......... 7,925 4,475 4,142 6 16,548 $ 98,984 $ 23,406 $ 20,000 $ 39,299 $ 181,689 Year ended December 31, 2003: Geological and geophysical costs.......... $ 40,783 $ 7,689 $ 4,426 $ 3,903 $ 56,801 Exploratory dry holes..................... 27,015 2,672 10,963 20,250 60,900 Leasehold abandonments and other.......... 4,934 7,715 2,302 108 15,059 $ 72,732 $ 18,076 $ 17,691 $ 24,261 $ 132,760 Year ended December 31, 2002: Geological and geophysical costs.......... $ 22,761 $ 4,138 $ 3,544 $ 7,223 $ 37,666 Exploratory dry holes..................... 32,557 3,294 1,220 (539) 36,532 Leasehold abandonments and other.......... 7,637 2,874 1,077 108 11,696 $ 62,955 $ 10,306 $ 5,841 $ 6,792 $ 85,894 The increase in 2004 exploration, abandonments, geological and geophysical expense, as compared to 2003, was primarily due to a $25.5 million increase in geological and geophysical expenditures and a $21.9 million increase in dry hole expense. The increase in geological and geophysical expenditures during 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily due to expenditures supportive of exploration activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, Argentina and Africa. Significant components of the Companys dry hole expense during 2004 included $27.7 million and $10.5 million on the Companys deepwater Gulf of Mexico Juno and Myrtle Beach prospects, respectively, $19.0 million on the Companys Gabonese Olowi prospect and $5.8 million on the Companys Bravo prospect offshore Equatorial Guinea. During 2004, the Company drilled and evaluated 103 exploration/extension wells, 58 of which were successfully completed as discoveries. During 2003, the Company drilled and evaluated 87 exploration/extension wells, 42 of which were successfully completed as discoveries. The increase in 2003 exploration, abandonments, geological and geophysical expense, as compared to 2002, was primarily due to increased geological and geophysical expenditures supportive of exploration activities in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska and a $24.4 million increase in exploratory dry hole expense. The increase in exploratory dry hole expense during 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to an increase in Canadian exploratory drilling activities and three unsuccessful wells drilled in South Africa and one unsuccessful well drilled in Tunisia. General and administrative expenses. The Companys general and administrative expenses totaled $80.5 million ($1.20 per BOE), $60.5 million ($1.10 per BOE) and $48.4 million ($1.21 per BOE) during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expense during 2004, as compared to 2003, was primarily due to increases in administrative staff, including staff increases associated with the Evergreen merger, and performance related compensation costs, including the amortization of restricted stock awarded to officers, directors and employees during the three years ended December 31, 2004. The increase in general and administrative expense during 2003, as compared to 2002, was primarily due to increases in administrative staff and performance related compensation costs, including the amortization of restricted stock awarded to officers, directors and key employees during 2003 and 2002. Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations. During the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations of $8.2 million and $5.0 million, respectively. The provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting 41 for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143") require that the accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations be classified in the consolidated statement of operations separate from interest expense. Prior to 2003 and the adoption of SFAS 143, the Company classified accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations as a component of interest expense. The Companys interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2002 included $2.6 million of accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations that was calculated prior to the adoption of SFAS 143 based on asset retirement obligations recorded in purchased business combinations. See Notes B and M of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys adoption of SFAS 143. The increase in accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations for 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily due to the increase in future plugging and abandonment obligations related to new wells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Tunisia and South Africa and fourth quarter accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations associated with the Evergreen merger. Interest expense. Interest expense was $103.4 million, $91.4 million and $95.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, while the weighted average interest rate on the Companys indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2004 was 5.4 percent as compared to 5.3 percent and 5.7 percent for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, taking into account the effect of interest rate derivatives. The increase in interest expense for 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily due to an $8.0 million decrease in interest rate hedge gains, a $3.4 million decrease in capitalized interest as the Company completed its major development projects in the Gulf of Mexico and South Africa, increased borrowings under the Companys lines of credit, primarily as a result of the Evergreen merger, and the assumption of $300 million of notes in connection with the Evergreen merger. The decrease in interest expense for 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to (i) $4.8 million of interest savings associated with the July 2002 repayment of a $45.2 million West Panhandle gas field capital obligation which bore interest at an annual rate of 20 percent; (ii) $4.1 million of incremental savings from the Companys interest rate hedging program; a $2.6 million decrease in accretion expense (see "Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations", above); and (iii) lower underlying market interest rates and outstanding debt. Partially offsetting the decreases in interest expense was a $6.8 million decrease in interest capitalized during 2003 as compared to 2002 due to the completion of the Canyon Express and Falcon area development projects. During July 2004, the Company exchanged $526.8 million of three existing series of senior notes for a like principal amount of New Notes and cash. In accordance with GAAP, the Company accounted for the debt exchange during the third quarter of 2004 as a replacement of the exchanged debt and began amortizing a $109.0 million payment made in conjunction with the debt exchange which represented the market value of the exchanged senior notes in excess of their stated value, along with the unamortized carrying values attributable to the issuance costs, discounts and deferred hedge gains and losses of the exchanged debt, as adjustments of interest expense over the term of the New Notes. See Note F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information about the Companys long term debt, the July 2004 note exchange and interest expense. Other expenses. Other expenses were $33.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $21.3 million during 2003 and $39.6 million during 2002. See Note P of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a detailed description of the components included in other expenses. The increase in other expense for 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily due to incremental contingency adjustments of $11.8 million. The decrease in other expense for 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to a decrease of $20.9 million in losses on early extinguishment of debt. Income tax provisions (benefits). The Company recognized consolidated income tax provisions of $166.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2004, consolidated income tax benefits of $64.4 million during 2003 and consolidated income tax provisions of $5.1 million during 2002. The Companys consolidated income tax provisions in 2004 were comprised of a $3.1 million current United States federal, state and local tax provisions, a $22.2 million current foreign income tax provision, $143.8 million of deferred United States federal, state and local tax provisions and $2.7 million of deferred foreign tax benefits. 42 The Companys consolidated tax benefits in 2003 were comprised of a $.1 million current United States federal tax provision, an $11.1 million current foreign income tax provision, $76.3 million of deferred United States federal, state and local tax benefits and $.7 million of deferred foreign tax provisions. The 2003 deferred United States federal, state and local tax benefits include a $197.7 million benefit from the reversal of the Companys valuation allowances against United States deferred tax assets. The Companys consolidated tax provision for 2002 was comprised of current United States state and local taxes of $.2 million, current foreign taxes of $2.1 million and deferred foreign tax provisions of $2.8 million. The Companys 34.7 percent effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2004 is lower than the combined United States federal and state statutory rate of approximately 36.5 percent primarily due to the deferred tax benefit recognized associated with the Companys cancellation of the development of its Olowi field in Gabon. See Notes Q and T of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a discussion regarding the Companys reversal of its United States deferred tax valuation allowances during 2003 and the Companys decision to cancel its development of the Olowi field in Gabon. See "Critical Accounting Estimates" above and Note Q of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys tax position. Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 143 on January 1, 2003 and recognized a $15.4 million benefit from the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of $1.3 million of deferred income taxes. Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity Capital commitments. The Companys primary needs for cash are for exploration, development and acquisitions of oil and gas properties, repayment of contractual obligations and working capital obligations. Funding for exploration, development and acquisitions of oil and gas properties and repayment of contractual obligations may be provided by any combination of internally generated cash flow, proceeds from the disposition of non strategic assets or alternative financing sources as discussed in "Capital resources" below. Generally, funding for the Companys working capital obligations is provided by internally generated cash flows. Payments for acquisitions, net of cash acquired. The Company paid $880.4 million of cash, net of $12.1 million of cash acquired, to complete the Evergreen merger during 2004. As noted above, the Company also assumed $300 million principal amount of Evergreen notes and other current and noncurrent obligations associated with the Evergreen merger. As is further discussed in "Financing activities", below, and in Notes C and F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data", the Company financed the cash costs of the merger with a new $900 million 364 Day Credit Agreement (the "364 Day Credit Agreement"). Oil and gas properties. The Companys cash expenditures for additions to oil and gas properties during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 totaled $615.9 million, $688.1 million and $614.7 million, respectively. The Companys 2004 and 2003 expenditures for additions to oil and gas properties were internally funded by $1.1 billion and $763.7 million, respectively, of net cash provided by operating activities. The Companys 2002 expenditures for additions to oil and gas properties were funded by $332.2 million of net cash provided by operating activities, $118.9 million of proceeds from the disposition of assets and a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of 11.5 million shares of the Companys common stock during April 2002. The Company strives to maintain its indebtedness at reasonable levels in order to provide sufficient financial flexibility to take advantage of future opportunities. The Companys capital budget for 2005 is expected to range from $900 million to $950 million. The Company believes that net cash provided by operating activities during 2005 will be sufficient to fund the 2005 capital expenditures budget as well as reduce long term debt to achieve a targeted debt to book capitalization of less than 35 percent and fund the Companys 2005 dividends. For additional information regarding the Companys plans for 2005, see "2005 Outlook and Activities" above. 43 Contractual obligations, including off balance sheet obligations. The Companys contractual obligations include long term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments, derivative obligations, other liabilities and, during 2005, the VPP obligations. From time to time, the Company enters into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off balance sheet obligations of the Company. As of December 31, 2004, the material off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that the Company has entered into include (i) $57.1 million of undrawn letters of credit, (ii) operating lease agreements, (iii) drilling commitments and (iv) contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable such as derivative contracts that are sensitive to future changes in commodity prices and gas transportation commitments. The following table summarizes by period the payments due by the Company for contractual obligations estimated as of December 31, 2004: Payments Due by Year 2006 and 2008 and 2005 2007 2009 Thereafter (in thousands) Long term debt (a)................. $ 130,950 $ 832,075 $ 378,000 $1,151,579 Operating leases (b)............... 56,365 83,115 32,647 13,214 Drilling commitments (c)........... 10,468 7,957 Derivative obligations (d)......... 224,403 131,940 50,352 511 Other liabilities (e).............. 44,541 65,099 40,401 61,833 Transportation commitments (f)..... 58,622 119,697 118,929 287,021 $ 525,349 $1,239,883 $ 620,329 $1,514,158 (a) See Note F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data". The amounts included in the table above represent principal maturities only. (b) See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data". (c) Drilling commitments represent future minimum expenditure commitments under contracts that the Company was a party to on December 31, 2004 for drilling rig services and well commitments. (d) Derivative obligations represent net liabilities for oil and gas commodity derivatives that were valued as of December 31, 2004. These liabilities include $.2 million of current assets and $.9 million of long term liabilities that are fixed in amount and are not subject to continuing market risk. The ultimate settlement amounts of the remaining portions of the Companys derivative obligations are unknown because they are subject to continuing market risk. See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and Note K of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys derivative obligations. (e) The Companys other liabilities represent current and noncurrent other liabilities that are comprised of benefit obligations, litigation and environmental contingencies, asset retirement obligations and other obligations for which neither the ultimate settlement amounts nor their timings can be precisely determined in advance. See Notes H, J and M of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys post retirement benefit obligations, litigation contingencies and asset retirement obligations, respectively. (f) Transportation commitments represent estimated transportation fees on gas throughput commitments. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys transportation commitments. Capital resources. The Companys primary capital resources are net cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from financing activities and proceeds from sales of non strategic assets. The Company expects that these resources will be sufficient to fund its capital commitments in 2005. Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $1.1 billion, $763.7 million and $332.2 million, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 increased by $340.9 million, or 45 percent, as compared to that of 2003. The increase in 2004 was primarily due to increased production volumes and higher commodity prices as compared to 2003. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 increased by $431.4 million, or 130 percent, as compared to that of 2002. The increase in 2003 was primarily due to increased production volumes and higher commodity prices as compared to 2002. 44 Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $1.5 billion, $662.3 million and $508.1 million, respectively. The $869.2 million increase in cash used in investing activities during 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily due to $880.4 million paid, net of cash acquired, in conjunction with the Evergreen merger. The $154.2 million increase in cash used in investing activities during 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to a $73.4 million increase in additions to oil and gas properties and an $83.2 million decrease in proceeds from disposition of assets. The cash proceeds from asset divestitures during 2003 were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness. See "Results of Operations", above, and Note O of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding asset divestitures. Financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $414.3 million and $170.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2002, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2003, financing activities used $91.7 million of net cash. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily due to borrowings on the Companys lines of credit to finance the cash consideration paid in conjunction with the Evergreen merger offset by excess operating cash flows being used to repay borrowings on the Companys lines of credit and the $109.0 million paid in conjunction with the exchange of the Companys senior notes discussed below. During 2004, financing activities were comprised of $553.4 million of net principal borrowings on long term debt, $54.3 million of payments of other noncurrent liabilities, $26.6 million of dividends paid and $92.3 million of treasury stock purchases, partially offset by $35.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of long term incentive plan stock options and employee stock purchases. During 2003, financing activities were comprised of $105.5 million of net principal payments on long term debt, $14.1 million of payments of other noncurrent liabilities, $2.8 million of payments for deferred loan fees and $2.3 million of treasury stock purchases, partially offset by $33.0 million of proceeds from the exercise of long term incentive plan stock options and employee stock purchases. During 2002, the Companys financing activities were comprised of $236.0 million of proceeds, net of issuance costs, from the sale of 11.5 million shares of the Companys common stock; $48.0 million of net borrowings of long term debt; and $14.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of long term incentive plan stock options and employee stock purchases, partially offset by $124.2 million of payments of other noncurrent liabilities and $3.3 million of payments for debt issuance costs. Over the three year period ended December 31, 2004, the Company has entered into financing transactions with the intent of reducing its cost of capital and increasing liquidity through the extension of debt maturities. During 2004, the Company accepted tenders to exchange $117.9 million, $275.1 million and $133.8 million in principal amount of its 8 1/4% senior notes due 2007, 9 5/8% senior notes due 2010 and 7.50% senior notes due 2012 (collectively, the "Old Notes"), respectively, for a like principal amount of New Notes and cash. The exchange of the Old Notes for the New Notes reduces the Companys future cash interest expense incurred and extended the associated debt maturities. During September 2004, the Company entered into the 364 Day Credit Agreement that was used to finance the cash consideration associated with the Evergreen merger. Borrowings under the 364 Day Credit Agreement may, at the option of the Company, be designated to bear interest based on (a) a rate per annum equal to the higher of the prime rate announced from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank or the weighted average of the rates on overnight Federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System during the last preceding business day plus 50 basis point or (b) a base Eurodollar rate, substantially equal to LIBOR, plus a margin that is based on a grid of the Companys debt rating (75 basis points per annum at December 31, 2004). Effective February 4, 2005, the Company requested that commitments under the 364 Day Credit Agreement be reduced by $250 million to $650 million. Also in connection with the Evergreen merger, the Company assumed $100 million of 4.75% Senior Convertible Notes due 2021 (the "Convertible Notes") and $200 million of 5.875% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012 (the "EVG 5.875% Notes"). During October 2004, the Company issued a Notice of Change of Control, Offer to Purchase, and the Consent Solicitation Statement (the "Notice") (i) notifying holders of the EVG 5.875% Notes of their right to require the Company to repurchase their EVG 5.875% Notes pursuant to the terms set forth in the Notice and (ii) soliciting consents to proposed amendments to the indenture governing the EVG 5.875% Notes (the "Consent Solicitation"). A majority of the holders of the EVG 5.875% Notes approved the Consent Solicitation which had the effect of (i) eliminating the subordination of the right of payment on the EVG 5.875% Notes, (ii) amending certain restrictive covenants applicable to the EVG 5.875% Notes so that they are the same as the restrictive covenants governing the Companys other senior notes and (iii) amending provisions that suspend other restrictive covenants when the EVG 5.875% Notes receive certain investment grade ratings. Associated with the Offer to Purchase, the Company accepted tenders for and redeemed $5.5 million of the EVG 5.875% Notes. As a result of the Evergreen merger, the Convertible Notes are redeemable at any time at the option of the 45 holders. If the holders of the Convertible Notes do not redeem the Convertible Notes prior to December 20, 2006, the Company intends to exercise its rights under the indenture and redeem the Convertible Notes on such date for cash, common stock or a combination thereof. See Notes F and K of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data" and "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for more information about the Companys debt instruments and interest rate hedging activities. The Companys future debt level is dependent primarily on net cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from financing activities and proceeds generated from asset dispositions. The Company believes it has substantial borrowing capacity, which has been further enhanced during 2005 by the use of the VPP net proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness, to meet any unanticipated cash requirements, and during low commodity price periods, the Company has the flexibility to increase borrowings and or modify its capital spending to meet its contractual obligations and maintain its debt ratings. During 2005, $131.0 million of the Companys 8 7/8% senior notes due 2005 (the "8 7/8% Notes") will mature and the 364 Day Credit Agreement will have its first anniversary. The Company intends to initially utilize unused borrowing capacity under its 364 Day Credit Agreement to repay the 8 7/8% Notes and to transfer outstanding borrowings, if any, under the 364 Day Credit Agreement to the Companys Revolving Credit Agreement on its first anniversary. The Company also intends to refinance, under its Revolving Credit Agreement, the cash component of a redemption price associated with any redemption of the Convertible Notes prior to December 2006, should redemptions occur. Accordingly, the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet does not reflect any current portion of long term debt as of December 31, 2004. As the Company pursues its strategy, it may utilize various financing sources, including fixed and floating rate debt, convertible securities, preferred stock or common stock. The Company may also issue securities in exchange for oil and gas properties, stock or other interests in other oil and gas companies or related assets. Additional securities may be of a class preferred to common stock with respect to such matters as dividends and liquidation rights and may also have other rights and preferences as determined by the Companys board of directors. Liquidity. The Companys principal source of short term liquidity is its revolving lines of credit. Outstanding borrowings under the lines of credit totaled $828 million as of December 31, 2004. Including $49.3 million of undrawn and outstanding letters of credit under the lines of credit, the Company had $722.7 million of unused borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2004. Book capitalization and current ratio. The Companys book capitalization at December 31, 2004 was $5.2 billion, consisting of debt of $2.4 billion and stockholders equity of $2.8 billion. Consequently, the Companys debt to book capitalization decreased to 45.7 percent at December 31, 2004 from 46.9 percent at December 31, 2003. As more fully discussed in "2005 Outlook and Activities" above, the Company has targeted a range for debt to book capitalization of less than 35 percent by the end of 2005. The Companys ratio of current assets to current liabilities was .57 at December 31, 2004 as compared to .48 at December 31, 2003. The improvement in the Companys ratio of current assets to current liabilities was primarily due to increases in oil and gas receivables due to higher commodity prices. Debt ratings. The Company receives debt credit ratings from Standard & Poors Ratings Group, Inc. ("S&P") and Moodys Investor Services, Inc. ("Moodys") and are subject to regular reviews. The Companys debt is currently rated BBB with a negative outlook by S&P and Baa3 with a negative outlook by Moodys, both of which are investment grade ratings. S&P and Moodys consider many factors in determining the Companys ratings including: production growth opportunities, liquidity, debt levels and asset and reserve mix. There are no "ratings triggers" in any of the Companys contractual obligations that would accelerate the related scheduled maturities should the Companys ratings fall below certain levels. If the Company were to be downgraded by either S&P or Moodys, it could negatively impact the interest rate and fees on existing indebtedness and the Companys ability to obtain additional financing or the interest rate and fees associated with additional financing. New Accounting Pronouncement On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share Based Payment" ("SFAS 123(R)"), which is a revision of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" ("SFAS 46 123"). SFAS 123(R) supersedes Accounting Principles Bulletin Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25") and amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows". Generally, the approach in SFAS 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS 123. However, SFAS 123(R) will require all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. SFAS 123(R) must be adopted no later than July 1, 2005 and permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods: o A "modified prospective" method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of SFAS 123(R) for all share based payments granted after the effective date and based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the adoption date of SFAS 123(R) that remain unvested on the adoption date. o A "modified retrospective" method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above, but also permits entities to restate either all prior periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures. The Company has elected to adopt the provisions of SFAS 123(R) on July 1, 2005 using the modified prospective method. As permitted by SFAS 123, the Company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB 25 and related interpretations. As such, the Company generally does not recognize compensation expenses associated with employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS 123(R)s fair value method could have a significant impact on the Companys future result of operations, although it will have no impact on the Companys overall financial position. Had the Company adopted SFAS 123(R) in prior periods, the impact would have approximated the impact of SFAS 123 as described in the pro forma net income and earnings per share disclosures in Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data". The adoption of SFAS 123(R) will have no effect on the Companys outstanding restricted stock awards. The Company estimates that the adoption of SFAS 123(R), based on the outstanding unvested stock options at December 31, 2004, will result in future compensation charges to general and administrative expenses of approximately $1.8 million during the period from July 1, 2005 through December 31, 2005, and approximately $1.1 million during 2006. The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") that allows eligible employees to annually purchase the Companys common stock at a discount. The provisions of SFAS 123(R) will cause the ESPP to be a compensatory plan. However, the change in accounting for the ESPP is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position, future results of operations or liquidity. Historically, the ESPP compensatory amounts have been nominal. See Note H of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the ESPP. SFAS 123(R) also requires the tax benefits in excess of recognized compensation expenses to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement may serve to reduce the Companys future cash provided by operating activities and increase future cash provided by financing activities, to the extent of associated tax benefits that may be realized in the future. While the Company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future (because they depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options), the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were $6.6 million and $14.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company did not recognize any such tax benefits during 2002. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following quantitative and qualitative information is provided about financial instruments to which the Company was a party as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and from which the Company may incur future gains or losses from changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. 47 Although certain derivative contracts that the Company was a party to did not qualify as hedges, the Company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading purposes. The fair value of the Companys derivative contracts are determined based on counterparties estimates and valuation models. The Company did not change its valuation method during the year ended December 31, 2004. During 2004, the Company was a party to commodity and interest rate swap contracts and commodity collar contracts. See Note K of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys derivative contracts, including deferred gains and losses on terminated derivative contracts. The following table reconciles the changes that occurred in the fair values of the Companys open derivative contracts during 2004: Derivative Contract Assets (Liabilities) Interest Commodity Rate Total (in thousands) > Fair value of contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2003................... $ (201,422) $ $ (201,422) Fair value of Evergreen contracts assumed...

Quantitative Disclosures Interest rate sensitivity. The following tables provide information about other financial instruments that the Company was a party to as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 and that are or were sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the tables present maturities by expected maturity dates, the weighted average interest rates expected to be paid on the debt given current contractual terms and market conditions and the debts estimated fair value. For fixed rate debt, the weighted average interest rate represents the contractual fixed rates that the Company was obligated to periodically pay on the debt as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. For variable rate debt, the average interest rate represents the average rates being paid on the debt projected forward proportionate to the forward yield curve for LIBOR on January 31, 2005.

Foreign exchange rate sensitivity. There were no outstanding foreign exchange rate hedge derivatives at December 31, 2004 and 2003. Commodity price sensitivity. The following tables provide information about the Companys oil and gas derivative financial instruments that were sensitive to changes in oil and gas prices as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, all of the Companys oil and gas derivative financial instruments qualified as hedges. Commodity hedge instruments. The Company hedges commodity price risk with derivative contracts, such as swap and collar contracts. Swap contracts provide a fixed price for a notional amount of sales volumes. Collar contracts provide minimum ("floor") and maximum ("ceiling") prices for the Company on a notional amount of sales volumes, thereby allowing some price participation if the relevant index price closes above the floor price. See Notes B, E and K of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a description of the accounting procedures followed by the Company relative to hedge derivative financial instruments and for specific information regarding the terms of the Companys derivative financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in oil and gas prices. 49 Oil Price Sensitivity Derivative Financial Instruments as of December 31, 2004 Liability Year Ending December 31, Fair Value at December 31, 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2004 (in thousands) Oil Hedge Derivatives (a): Average daily notional Bbl volumes: Swap contracts (b)....... 27,000 14,500 17,000 21,000 3,500 1,000 2,000 2,000 $ (261,111) Weighted average fixed price per Bbl.......... $ 27.97 $ 34.12 $ 32.59 $ 30.72 $36.48 $36.10 $35.93 $35.86 Collar contracts......... 3,500 $ (2,278) Weighted average ceiling price per Bbl.......... $ $ 41.95 $ $ $ $ $ $ Weighted average floor price per Bbl.......... $ $ 35.00 $ $ $ $ $ $ Average forward NYMEX oil prices (c)........... $ 48.58 $ 45.26 $ 43.08 $ 41.01 $40.36 $39.91 $39.71 $39.51 (a) See Note K of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8.

The Company is a borrower under fixed rate and variable rate debt instruments that give rise to interest rate risk. The Companys objective in borrowing under fixed or variable rate debt is to satisfy capital requirements while minimizing the Companys costs of capital. See Note F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a discussion of the Companys debt instruments. Derivative financial instruments. The Company utilizes interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity price derivative contracts to hedge interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity price risks in accordance with policies and guidelines approved by the Companys board of directors. In accordance with those policies and guidelines, the Companys executive management determines the appropriate timing and extent of hedge transactions. Foreign currency, operations and price risk. International investments represent, and are expected to continue to represent, a significant portion of the Companys total assets. Pioneer currently has international operations in Africa, Argentina and Canada, which represent nine, seven and five percent of the Companys 2004 revenues, respectively. Pioneer continues to identify and evaluate other international opportunities. As a result of such foreign operations, Pioneers financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, weak economic conditions or changes in political climates in these foreign countries. The Companys international operations may be adversely affected by political and economic instability, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and other factors. For example: o local political and economic developments could restrict or increase the cost of Pioneers foreign operations, o exchange controls and currency fluctuations could result in financial losses, o royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims could increase costs of Pioneers foreign operations, o expropriation of the Companys property could result in loss of revenue, property and equipment, o civil uprising, riots, terrorist attacks and wars could make it impractical to continue operations, resulting in financial losses, o import and export regulations and other foreign laws or policies could result in loss of revenues, o repatriation levels for export revenues could restrict the availability of cash to fund operations outside a particular foreign country and o laws and policies of the U.S. affecting foreign trade, taxation and investment could restrict Pioneers ability to fund foreign operations or may make foreign operations more costly. Pioneer does not currently maintain political risk insurance. Pioneer evaluates on a country by country basis whether obtaining political risk coverage is necessary and may add such insurance in the future if the Company believes it is prudent. Africa. Pioneers operations in Africa are in South Africa, Tunisia, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. The Company views the operating environment in these African nations as stable and the economic stability as good. While the values of the various African nations currencies do fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar, the Company believes that any currency risk associated with Pioneers African operations would not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations given that such operations are closely tied to oil prices which are denominated in U.S. dollars. Argentina. During the decade of the 1990s, Argentinas government pursued free market policies, including the privatization of state owned companies, deregulation of the oil and gas industry, tax reforms to equalize tax rates for domestic and foreign investors, liberalization of import and export laws and the lifting of exchange controls. The cornerstone of these reforms was the 1991 convertibility law that established an exchange rate of one Argentine peso to one U.S. dollar. These policies were successful as evidenced by the elimination of inflation and substantial economic growth during the early to mid 1990s. However, throughout the decade, the Argentine government failed to balance its fiscal budget, incurring repeated significant fiscal deficits that by the end of 2001 resulted in the accumulation of $130 billion of debt. 52 During 2001, Argentina found itself in a critical economic situation with the combination of high levels of external indebtedness, a financial and banking system in crisis, a country risk rating that had reached levels beyond the historical norm, a high level of unemployment and an economic contraction that had lasted four years. Late in 2001, the country was unable to obtain additional funding from the International Monetary Fund. Economic instability increased, resulting in substantial withdrawals of cash from the Argentine banking system over a short period of time. The government was forced to implement monetary restrictions and placed limitations on the transfer of funds out of the country without the authorization of the Central Bank of the Republic of Argentina. President De la Rua and his entire administration were forced to resign in the face of public dissatisfaction. After his resignation in December 2001, there was, for a few weeks, a revolving door of presidents that were appointed to office by Argentinas Congress, but quickly resigned in reaction to public outcry. Eduardo Duhalde was appointed President of Argentina in January 2002 to hold office until the 2003 Presidential election. In January 2002, the government defaulted on a significant portion of Argentinas $130 billion of debt and the national Congress passed Emergency Law 25,561, which, among other things, overturned the long standing, but unsustainable, convertibility plan. The government adopted a floating rate of exchange in February 2002. Two specific provisions of the Emergency Law directly impact the Company. First, a tax on the value of hydrocarbon exports was established effective March 1, 2002. The second provision was the requirement that domestic commercial transactions, or contracts, for sales in Argentina that were previously denominated in U.S. dollars be converted to pesos (i.e., pesofication) at an exchange rate to be negotiated between sellers and buyers. Furthermore, the government placed a price freeze on gas prices at the wellhead. With the price of gas pesofied and frozen, the U.S. dollar equivalent price of gas in Argentina fell in direct proportion to the level of devaluation. The abandonment of the convertibility plan and the decision to allow the peso to float in international exchange markets resulted in significant devaluation of the peso. By September 30, 2002, the peso to U.S. dollar exchange rate had increased from 1:1 to 3.74:1. However, since the end of the third quarter of 2002, Argentinas economy has shown signs of stabilization. At December 31, 2004, the peso to U.S. dollar exchange rate was 2.98:1. In Argentina, unlike Pioneers other operating areas, there have been significant factors that have kept the commodity prices, in general, below those of the world markets and may continue to do so. The following is a discussion of the matters affecting Argentine commodity prices: o Oil Prices In January 2002, the Argentine government devalued the peso and enacted an emergency law that, in part, required certain contracts that were previously payable in U.S. dollars to be payable in pesos. Subsequently, in February 2002, the Argentine government announced a 20 percent tax on oil exports, effective March 1, 2002. The tax is limited by law to a term of no more than five years. The export tax is not deducted in the calculation of royalty payments. Domestic Argentine oil sales, while valued in U.S. dollars, are now being paid in pesos. Export oil sales continue to be valued and paid in U.S. dollars. In January 2003, at the Argentine governments request, oil producers and refiners agreed to cap amounts payable for certain domestic sales at $28.50 per Bbl which remained in effect through April 2004. The producers and refiners further agreed that the difference between the actual price and the capped price would be payable once actual prices fall below the $28.50 cap. Subsequently the terms were modified such that while the $28.50 per Bbl payable cap was in place, the refiners would have no obligation to pay producers for sales values that exceeded $36.00 per Bbl. Initially, the refiners and producers also agreed to discount U.S. dollar denominated oil prices at 90 percent prior to converting to pesos at the current exchange rate for the purpose of invoicing and settling oil sales to Argentine refiners. In May 2004, refiners and producers changed the discount percentage from 90 percent for all price levels to 86 percent if WTI was equal to or less than $36 per Bbl and 80 percent if WTI exceeded $36 per Bbl. All the oil prices are adjusted for normal quality differentials prior to applying the discount. In May 2004, the Argentine government increased the export tax from 20 percent to 25 percent. This tax is applied on the sales value after the tax, thus, the net effect of the 20 percent and 25 percent rates is 16.7 percent and 20 percent, respectively. In August 2004, the Argentine government further increased the export tax rates for oil exports. The export tax now escalates from the current 25 percent 53 (20 percent effective rate) to a maximum rate of 45 percent (31 percent effective rate) of the realized value for exported barrels as WTI prices per barrel increase from less than $32.00 to $45.00 and above. During 2002 and 2003, the Company exported approximately 29 percent and five percent, respectively, of its Argentine oil production. Associated therewith, the Company incurred oil export taxes of $2.2 million and $1.2 million for 2002 and 2003, respectively. During 2004, the Company did not export any of its Argentine oil production. As noted above, the export tax has also had the effect of decreasing internal Argentine oil revenues (not only export revenues) by the taxes levied. The U.S. dollar equivalent value for domestic Argentine oil sales has generally moved toward parity with the U.S. dollar denominated export values, net of the export tax. The adverse impact of this tax has been partially offset by the net cost savings resulting from the devaluation of the peso on peso denominated costs such as labor. Given the number of governmental changes during 2004 affecting the realized price the Company receives for its oil sales, no specific predictions can be made about the future of oil prices in Argentina, however, in the short term, the Company expects Argentine oil realizations to be less than oil realizations in the United States. o Gas Prices The Company sells its gas to Argentine customers pursuant to (a) peso denominated contracts, (b) long term dollar denominated contracts and (c) spot market sales. As a result of economic emergency law enacted by the Argentine government in January 2002, the Companys gas prices, expressed in U.S. dollars, have fallen in proportion to the devaluation of the Argentine peso since the end of 2001 due to the pesofication of contracts and the freezing of gas prices at the wellhead required by that law. As a baseline, the Companys 2001 realized gas price was $1.31 per Mcf as compared to $.48, $.56 and $.66 in 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. The unfavorable gas price has acted to discourage gas development activities and increased gas demand. Without development of gas reserves in Argentina, supplies of gas in the country have declined, while demand for gas has been increasing due to the resurgence of the Argentine economy and the higher cost of alternative fuels. Recently, gas exports to Chile were curtailed at the direction of the Argentine government and Argentina entered into an agreement to import gas from Bolivia at prices starting at approximately $2.00 per Mcf (at the border), including transportation costs. In May 2004, pursuant to a decree, the Argentine government approved measures to permit producers to renegotiate gas sales contracts, excluding those that could affect small residential customers, in accordance with scheduled price increases specified in the decree. The wellhead prices in the decree rise from a current range of $.61 to $.78 per Mcf to a range of $.87 to $1.04 per Mcf after July 2005, depending on the region where the gas is produced. No further gas price increases beyond July 2005 have been allowed for in the current decree. Other than an expectation that gas prices will be permitted to increase gradually over time, as has already been demonstrated by the governing authorities, no specific predictions can be made about the future of gas prices in Argentina, however, the Company expects Argentine gas realizations to be less than gas realizations in the United States. Canada. The Company views the operating environment in Canada as stable and the economic stability as good. A portion of the Companys Canadian revenues and substantially all of its costs are denominated in Canadian dollars. While the value of the Canadian dollar does fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar, the Company believes that any currency risk associated with its Canadian operations would not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. As of December 31, 2004, the Companys primary risk exposures associated with financial instruments to which it is a party include oil and gas price volatility, volatility in the exchange rates of the Canadian dollar and Argentine peso vis a vis the U.S. dollar and interest rate volatility. The Companys primary risk exposures associated with financial instruments have not changed significantly since December 31, 2004. 54
