ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Strategic Initiatives During September 2005, the Company announced that the Board approved the following strategic initiatives to enhance shareholder value and investment returns: Approval of a $1 billion share repurchase program, $650 million of which was immediately initiated and substantially completed during 2005. The remaining $350 million is subject to the completion of the planned deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine divestments discussed below. A plan to divest the Companys assets in the Tierra del Fuego area in southern Argentina. The plan was later broadened to include entertaining offers for a complete sale of all of the Companys Argentine assets. During January 2006, Pioneer entered into an agreement to sell its assets in Argentina for $675 million. A plan to divest the Companys assets in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Bids to purchase the properties were received in January 2006 and the Company is currently engaged in negotiations for the sale of these assets. No assurance can be given that a sale can be completed on terms acceptable to the Company. The implementation of the Boards strategic initiatives is allowing Pioneer to (i) allocate and focus its investment capital more heavily towards predictable oil and gas basins in North America that have delivered relatively strong and consistent growth and (ii) lower its risk profile by expanding North American unconventional resource investments while reducing exploration expenditures. The divestiture of the Companys Argentine oil and gas assets will allow the Company to leverage the current commodity price environment to monetize and exit operations in an area that has become characterized by lower operating margins, government controlled pricing and modest production growth opportunities. The divestiture of the Companys deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets, if successful, will also allow the Company to monetize and exit operations in an area that is characterized by escalating drilling and operating costs and relatively high exploration risk and production volatility. Financial and Operating Performance Pioneers financial and operating performance for the year ended December 31, 2005 included the following highlights: Average daily sales volumes on a BOE basis decreased one percent in 2005 as compared to 2004. Oil and gas revenues increased 25 percent in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily as a result of increases in worldwide oil and Argentine and North American gas prices. Interest and other income increased by $83.0 million in 2005 as compared to 2004, primarily due to $73.6 million of business interruption insurance claims related to (a) the Hurricane Ivan disruptions and (b) the Fain gas plant fire. Other expense increased by $79.1 million in 2005 as compared to 2004, primarily due to increases of $50.5 million and $26.0 million in losses associated with commodity hedge ineffectiveness and debt extinguishments, respectively. Income from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle increased by 54 percent to $715.5 million in 2005 from $463.1 million in 2004. Net income increased to $534.6 million ($3.80 per diluted share) for 2005, as compared to $312.9 million ($2.46 per diluted share) for 2004. The Company recognized income from discontinued operations of $110.8 million ($.78 per diluted share) during 2005 attributable to the sale of certain Gulf of Mexico shelf and Canadian properties. Outstanding debt decreased by $327.5 million, or 14 percent, as of December 31, 2005 as compared to debt outstanding as of December 31, 2004. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 23 percent to a record $1.3 billion in 2005 as compared to $1.1 billion in 2004. The Company declared $.22 per share of common dividends during 2005. The Company repurchased 20 million shares of the Companys common stock for $949.3 million during 2005. 36 Table of Contents The Company sold three VPPs for net proceeds of $892.6 million. Total proved reserves of 986.7 MMBOE at December 31, 2005. Current Events Argentina divestiture. During September 2005, the Company announced that it would pursue the sale of its nonoperated assets in Tierra del Fuego. During the Tierra del Fuego sales process, several prospective buyers indicated that they could enhance their value for a transaction in Argentina if it included all of Pioneers assets. The Company decided that if a buyer presented an attractive offer for all of the Argentine assets, that it would consider exiting Argentina. On January 17, 2006, the Company announced signing an agreement with Apache Corporation to sell all of the Companys interests in Argentina for $675 million (subject to normal closing adjustments). The transaction is expected to close during the latter part of the first quarter or in early April of 2006. The results of operations from these assets will be reflected as discontinued operations in the Companys future financial statements if the sale is closed. Oooguruk development. In February 2006, the Company announced that it has approved and is commencing the development of the Oooguruk field in shallow waters off the North Slope of Alaska. The Company has a 70 percent working interest in the field. Following the construction of a gravel drilling and production site during the 2006, a subsea flowline and facilities will be installed during 2007 to carry produced liquids to existing onshore processing facilities at the Kuparuk River Unit. Between 2007 and 2009, Pioneer plans to drill approximately 40 horizontal wells in the Oooguruk field. Total gross capital invested, including projected drilling and facility costs, is expected to range from $450 million to $525 million. First production from these wells is expected to begin in 2008. South Coast Gas project. In December 2005, the Company announced the final approvals with its partner in the South Coast Gas project. Pioneer has a 45 percent working interest in the project. The project will include subsea tie back of gas from the Sable field and six additional gas accumulations to the existing production facilities on the F A platform for transportation via existing pipelines to a GTL plant. The Company has signed a contract for the sale of its share of gas and condensate to the GTL plant. Production is expected to begin during the second half of 2007 and increase to an average of approximately 100 MMcf per day of gas and 3,000 Bbls per day of condensate over the initial phase of the project through 2012. Development drilling related to the project is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2006. Deepwater Gulf of Mexico divestiture. During September 2005, the Company announced its plans to pursue the divestment of its deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets to reduce the exploration risk and production volatility that have been associated with these properties. The deepwater Gulf of Mexico bid process has been completed and the Company is currently engaged in negotiations for the sale of these assets. No assurance can be given that a sale can be completed on terms acceptable to the Company. The results of operations from these assets will be reflected as discontinued operations in the Companys future financial statements if the divestiture is completed. Acquisitions Evergreen merger. On September 28, 2004, Pioneer completed a merger with Evergreen. Pioneer acquired the common stock of Evergreen for a total purchase price of approximately $1.8 billion, which was comprised of cash and Pioneer common stock. At the merger date, Evergreens proved reserves were approximately 262 MMBOE. Evergreen was primarily engaged in the production, development, exploration and acquisition of North American unconventional gas and was one of the leading developers of CBM reserves in the United States. Evergreens operations were principally focused on developing and expanding its CBM gas field located in the Raton Basin in southern Colorado. Evergreen also had operations in the Piceance Basin in western Colorado, the Uinta Basin in eastern Utah and the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin. Permian Basin and Onshore Gulf Coast areas. In July 2005, the Company completed the purchase of approximately 70 MMBOE of substantially undeveloped proved oil reserves in the United States core areas of the Permian Basin and South Texas for $176.9 million. The assets acquired provide an estimated 800 undrilled well locations. 37 Table of Contents Divestitures Volumetric production payments. During January 2005, the Company sold two percent of its total proved reserves, or 20.5 MMBOE of proved reserves in the Hugoton and Spraberry fields, by means of two VPPs for net proceeds of $592.3 million, including the assignment of the Companys obligations under certain derivative hedge agreements. During April 2005, the Company sold less than one percent of its total proved reserves, or 7.3 MMBOE of proved reserves in the Spraberry field, by means of a VPP for net proceeds of $300.3 million, including the value attributable to certain derivative hedge agreements assigned to the buyer of the April VPP. The Companys VPPs represent limited term overriding royalty interests in oil and gas reserves which: (i) entitle the purchaser to receive production volumes over a period of time from specific lease interests; (ii) are free and clear of all associated future production costs and capital expenditures; (iii) are nonrecourse to the Company (i.e., the purchasers only recourse is to the assets acquired); (iv) transfers title of the assets to the purchaser and (v) allows the Company to retain the assets after the VPPs volumetric quantities have been delivered. Canada and Gulf of Mexico. During May 2005, the Company sold all of its interests in the Martin Creek and Conroy Black areas of northeast British Columbia and the Lookout Butte area of southern Alberta for net proceeds of $197.2 million, resulting in a gain of $138.3 million. During August 2005, the Company sold all of its interests in certain oil and gas properties on the shelf of the Gulf of Mexico for net proceeds of $59.1 million, resulting in a gain of $27.7 million. The historic results of operations of these properties have been removed from the Companys reported income from continuing operations and are included, together with the gains from the divestitures, in income from discontinuing operations, net of taxes. Gabon divestiture. In October 2005, the Company closed the sale of the shares in a Gabonese subsidiary that owns the interest in the Olowi block for $47.9 million of net proceeds. A gain was recognized during the fourth quarter of 2005 of $47.5 million with no associated income tax effect either in Gabon or the United States. In addition, Pioneer retains the potential, under certain circumstances, to receive additional payments for production from deeper reservoirs discovered on the block. 2006 Outlook and Activities Commodity prices. World oil prices increased during the year ended December 31, 2005 in response to continued demand growth in Asian economies, hurricane disruptions in the Gulf of Mexico, political unrest and supply disruptions in Middle East and Venezuela and other supply and demand factors. North American gas prices also increased during 2005 in response to continued strong demand fundamentals while supply uncertainties still remain. The Companys outlook for 2006 commodity prices continues to be cautiously optimistic. Significant factors that will impact 2006 commodity prices include developments in Iraq, Iran and other Middle East countries, the extent to which members of the OPEC and other oil exporting nations are able to manage oil supply through export quotas and variations in key North American gas supply and demand indicators. Pioneer will continue to strategically hedge oil and gas price risk to mitigate the impact of price volatility on its oil, NGL and gas revenues. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the Companys commodity hedge positions at December 31, 2005. Also see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for disclosures about the Companys commodity related derivative financial instruments. Preliminary 2006 capital budget. In certain of its prior Annual Reports on Form 10 K, the Company has provided detailed information on its next year capital allocation and first quarter guidance with respect to production costs and expenses. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the Companys proposed divestitures of its Argentine and deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets, the Company is presently unable to provide similar information for 2006. The Company has prepared a preliminary capital budget that does not include capital for its Argentine assets but does include limited capital for the Companys deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets. The preliminary budget is approximately $1.3 billion and includes plans to drill 1,000 to 1,100 wells. The Companys preliminary 2006 capital 38 Table of Contents budget is heavily focused on development and extension drilling, including funding for the recently sanctioned Oooguruk and South Coast gas projects. Less than 20 percent of the preliminary 2006 capital budget is for exploration activities. The Companys final allocation of capital during 2006 is subject to the approval of the Board and is dependent on the outcome of the planned divestitures. Accordingly, the final budget may differ materially from the preliminary budget. Results of Operations Oil and gas revenues. Revenues from oil and gas operations totaled $2.2 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.2 billion during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The revenue increase during 2005, as compared to 2004, was due to an 18 percent increase in oil prices, a 26 percent increase in NGL prices and a 32 percent increase in gas prices, including the effects of commodity price hedges, partially offset by a one percent decrease in average daily BOE sales volumes. The revenue increase from 2003 to 2004 was due to a 22 percent increase in average daily BOE sales volumes, a 24 percent increase in oil prices, a 32 percent increase in NGL prices and a 14 percent increase in gas prices, including the effects of commodity price hedges. The following table provides average daily sales volumes from continuing operations, by geographic area and in total, for 2005, 2004 and 2003: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Oil (Bbls): United States 25,943 24,700 22,509 Argentina 7,869 8,534 8,687 Canada 210 72 35 Africa 10,065 11,676 1,981 Worldwide 44,087 44,982 33,212 NGLs (Bbls): United States 17,402 19,678 20,306 Argentina 1,824 1,546 1,318 Canada 503 425 473 Worldwide 19,729 21,649 22,097 Gas (Mcf): United States 497,068 516,294 417,972 Argentina 137,032 121,654 94,128 Canada 36,427 25,606 26,779 Worldwide 670,527 663,554 538,879 Total (BOE): United States 126,191 130,428 112,476 Argentina 32,531 30,356 25,694 Canada 6,784 4,764 4,971 Africa 10,065 11,676 1,981 Worldwide 175,571 177,224 145,122 Per BOE average daily production for 2005, as compared to 2004, increased by seven percent in Argentina and by 42 percent in Canada, while average daily sales volumes decreased by three percent in the United States and by 14 percent in Africa. 39 Table of Contents Average daily sales volumes from continuing operations in the United States was slightly lower in 2005 as compared to 2004 principally due to declining production in the Gulf of Mexico, asset divestitures and downtime at the Fain gas plant offset by a full year of production from the properties acquired in the Evergreen merger. Argentine average daily sales volumes increased as a result of successful development drilling and increased market demand during Argentinas summer season. The Company has increased its level of capital expenditures in Argentina as the stability of the Argentine peso and the general economic outlook for Argentina has improved and gas prices have increased. Canadian average daily sales volumes from continuing operations increased due to new production from Canadian properties acquired in the Evergreen merger and production from new wells drilled during 2005. Production is down in South Africa due to normal production declines and timing of oil shipments, partially offset by continued growth in Tunisia production. Per BOE average daily production for 2004, as compared to 2003, increased by 16 percent in the United States, increased by 18 percent in Argentina, decreased by four percent in Canada and the Company realized first production from South Africa and Tunisia during 2003. The increased production was principally attributable to (i) a full year of production from the Falcon area, (ii) new production being initiated from the Harrier, Raptor and Tomahawk fields in the Falcon area and at Devils Tower, (iii) fourth quarter production added from the Evergreen merger and (iv) oil sales having first been realized from the Companys Tunisian and South African oil projects during August and October of 2003, respectively. Argentine oil and gas sales volumes increased during 2004 primarily due to incremental production volumes that resulted from the Companys expanded drilling program and higher oil and gas demand during the summer season. The following table provides average daily sales volumes from discontinued operations during 2005, 2004 and 2003: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Oil (Bbls): United States 1,279 1,937 2,016 Canada 28 65 76 Worldwide 1,307 2,002 2,092 NGLs (Bbls): United States 65 60 32 Canada 112 492 433 Worldwide 177 552 465 Gas (Mcf): United States 4,136 5,545 5,041 Canada 6,489 16,261 14,890 Worldwide 10,625 21,806 19,931 Total (BOE): United States 2,033 2,921 2,888 Canada 1,221 3,267 2,991 Worldwide 3,254 6,188 5,879 40 Table of Contents The following table provides average reported prices from continuing operations, including the results of hedging activities, and average realized prices from continuing operations, excluding the results of hedging activities, by geographic area and in total, for 2005, 2004 and 2003: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Average reported prices: Oil (per Bbl): United States $ 31.09 $ 29.69 $ 25.09 Argentina $ 36.88 $ 28.06 $ 25.62 Canada $ 52.12 $ 48.37 $ 28.00 Africa $ 53.00 $ 38.12 $ 29.52 Worldwide $ 37.22 $ 31.60 $ 25.50 NGL (per Bbl): United States $ 31.72 $ 25.05 $ 19.03 Argentina $ 33.17 $ 29.91 $ 22.85 Canada $ 45.79 $ 32.03 $ 24.30 Worldwide $ 32.22 $ 25.54 $ 19.38 Gas (per Mcf): United States $ 6.83 $ 5.14 $ 4.45 Argentina $ .88 $ .66 $ .56 Canada $ 7.67 $ 4.72 $ 4.65 Worldwide $ 5.66 $ 4.30 $ 3.78 Average realized prices: Oil (per Bbl): United States $ 54.05 $ 39.54 $ 29.52 Argentina $ 36.88 $ 29.82 $ 26.31 Canada $ 52.12 $ 48.37 $ 28.00 Africa $ 53.00 $ 38.71 $ 30.07 Worldwide $ 50.74 $ 37.49 $ 28.71 NGL (per Bbl): United States $ 31.72 $ 25.05 $ 19.03 Argentina $ 33.17 $ 29.91 $ 22.85 Canada $ 45.79 $ 32.03 $ 24.30 Worldwide $ 32.22 $ 25.54 $ 19.38 Gas (per Mcf): United States $ 7.94 $ 5.71 $ 4.91 Argentina $ .88 $ .66 $ .56 Canada $ 7.67 $ 5.37 $ 4.79 Worldwide $ 6.49 $ 4.78 $ 4.15 Hedging activities. The oil and gas prices that the Company reports are based on the market price received for the commodities adjusted by the results of the Companys cash flow hedging activities. The Company utilizes commodity swap and collar contracts in order to (i) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities the Company produces and sells, (ii) support the Companys annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and (iii) reduce commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Companys commodity price hedges decreased oil and gas revenues from continuing operations by $420.4 million, $211.9 million and $110.7 million, respectively. The effective portions of changes in the fair values of the 41 Table of Contents Companys commodity price hedges are deferred as increases or decreases to stockholders equity until the underlying hedged transaction occurs. Consequently, changes in the effective portions of commodity price hedges add volatility to the Companys reported stockholders equity until the hedge derivative matures or is terminated. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for information concerning the impact to oil and gas revenues during 2005, 2004 and 2003 from the Companys hedging activities, the Companys open hedge positions at December 31, 2005 and descriptions of the Companys hedge commodity derivatives. Also see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional disclosures about the Companys commodity related derivative financial instruments. Subsequent to December 31, 2005, the Company reduced its oil and gas hedge positions by terminating the following swap and collar contracts: (i) 2,000 BPD of March through December 2006 oil swap contracts with a fixed price of $26.29 per Bbl; 1,000 BPD of calendar 2007 oil swap contracts with a fixed price of $31.00 per Bbl; 2,000 BPD of calendar 2008 oil swap contracts with a fixed price of $30.00 per Bbl; 2,000 BPD of March through December 2006 oil collar contracts having a floor price of $50.00 per Bbl and a ceiling price of $96.25 per Bbl; 2,500 BPD of calendar 2007 oil collar contracts having a floor price of $50.00 and a ceiling price of $91.18 per Bbl and (ii) 65,000 MMBtu per day of April through December 2006 gas collar contracts with a weighted average floor price per MMBtu of $6.74 and a weighted average ceiling price per MMBtu of $14.01. The aggregate value of the terminated oil and gas hedge contracts was a liability of $59.4 million on the dates of termination. Argentina commodity prices. During 2002, the Argentine government implemented a 20 percent tax on oil exports. In 2003, the Company exported approximately five percent of its Argentine oil production. Associated therewith, the Company incurred oil export taxes of $1.2 million for 2003. During 2004 and 2005, the Company did not export any of its Argentine oil production. The export tax has also had the effect of decreasing internal Argentine oil revenues (not only export revenues) by the taxes levied. The U.S. dollar equivalent value for domestic Argentine oil sales (now paid in pesos) has generally moved toward parity with the U.S. dollar denominated export values, net of the export tax. The adverse impact of this tax has been partially offset by the net cost savings resulting from the devaluation of the peso on peso denominated costs. In January 2003, at the Argentine governments request, oil producers and refiners agreed to cap amounts payable for certain domestic sales at $28.50 per Bbl, which remained in effect through April 2004. The producers and refiners further agreed that the difference between the actual price and the capped price would be payable once actual prices fall below the $28.50 cap. Subsequently the terms were modified such that while the $28.50 per Bbl payable cap was in place, the refiners would have no obligation to pay producers for sales values that exceeded $36.00 per Bbl. Initially, the refiners and producers also agreed to discount U.S. dollar denominated oil prices at 90 percent prior to converting to pesos at the current exchange rate for the purpose of invoicing and settling oil sales to Argentine refiners. In May 2004, refiners and producers changed the discount percentage from 90 percent for all price levels to 86 percent if West Texas Intermediate (WTI) was equal to or less than $36 per Bbl and 80 percent if WTI exceeded $36 per Bbl. All the oil prices are adjusted for normal quality differentials prior to applying the discount. In 2004, it appeared probable that the price of world oil would remain above the $28.50 cap for the foreseeable future. Given the uncertainty surrounding the timing of when Argentine producers could expect to collect balances outstanding from refiners, the Company ceased recognizing revenue and began recording any excess between the actual sales price pursuant to its oil sales contracts with Argentine refiners that were subject to the price stabilization agreement and the $28.50 price cap as deferred revenue in the balance sheet. The decision by Argentine oil producers and refiners to not renew the price stability agreement beyond April 30, 2004 does not terminate the obligation of refiners to reimburse producers for balances that accumulated from January 2003 through April 2004, if and when the price of WTI falls below $28.50. In May 2004, the Argentine government increased the export tax from 20 percent to 25 percent. This tax is applied on the sales value after the tax, thus, the net effect of the 20 percent and 25 percent rates is 16.7 percent and 20 percent, respectively. In August 2004, the Argentine government further increased the export tax rates for oil exports. The export tax now escalates from the current 25 percent (20 percent effective rate) to a maximum rate of 45 percent (31 percent effective rate) of the realized value for exported Bbls as WTI prices per Bbl increase from 42 Table of Contents less than $32.00 to $45.00 and above. The export tax is not deducted in the calculation of royalty payments and expires in February 2007. Given the number of governmental changes during 2005 affecting the realized price the Company receives for its oil sales, no specific predictions can be made about the future of oil prices in Argentina. However, in the short term, the Company expects Argentine oil realizations to be less than oil realizations in the United States. As a result of the economic emergency law enacted by the Argentine government in January 2002, the Companys gas prices, expressed in U.S. dollars, have also fallen in proportion to the devaluation of the Argentine peso since the end of 2001 due to the pesofication of contracts and freezing of gas prices at the wellhead required by that law. As a baseline, the Companys 2001 realized Argentine gas price was $1.31 per Mcf as compared to $.88, $.66 and $.56 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The unfavorable gas price has acted to discourage gas development activities and increased gas demand. Without development of gas reserves in Argentina, supplies of gas in the country have declined, while demand for gas has been increasing due to the resurgence of the Argentine economy and the higher cost of alternative fuels. Briefly during 2004, gas exports to Chile were curtailed at the direction of the Argentine government. Argentina has also entered into an agreement to import gas from Bolivia at prices starting at approximately $2.00 per Mcf (at the border), including transportation costs. In May 2004, pursuant to a decree, the Argentine government approved measures to permit producers to renegotiate gas sales contracts, excluding those that could affect small residential customers, in accordance with scheduled price increases specified in the decree. The wellhead prices in the decree increased from a 2004 range of $.61 to $.78 per Mcf to a range of $.87 to $1.04 per Mcf after July 1, 2005, depending on the region where the gas is produced. No further gas price increases beyond July 2005 have occurred. Other than an expectation that gas prices will be permitted to increase gradually over time, as has already been demonstrated by the governing authorities, no specific predictions can be made about the future of gas prices in Argentina. However, the Company expects Argentine gas realizations to be less than gas realizations in the United States. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion of commodity prices in Argentina. Interest and other income. The Company recorded interest and other income totaling $97.1 million, $14.1 million and $12.3 during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in interest and other income during 2005, as compared to 2004, is primarily attributable to the recognition of $73.6 million in business interruption insurance claims, of which $59.4 million relates to Hurricane Ivan and $14.2 million to the Fain plant fire. See Note M of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding interest and other income. Gain on disposition of assets. The Company recorded gains on disposition of assets of $60.5 million, $39,000 and $1.3 million during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In 2005, the gain is primarily related to (a) the sale of the stock of a subsidiary that owned the interest in the Olowi block in Gabon, which resulted in a $47.5 million gain and (b) a $14 million insurance settlement on the Companys East Cameron facility that was destroyed by Hurricane Rita, resulting in a $9.7 million gain. During 2005 the Company also recognized gains on the sale of certain assets in Canada and the shelf of the Gulf of Mexico of approximately $166.1 million. However, pursuant to SFAS 144 the gain and the results of operations from these assets have been reclassified to discontinued operations. The net cash proceeds from asset divestitures during 2005, 2004 and 2003 were used, together with net cash flows provided by operating activities, to fund additions to oil and gas properties and to reduce outstanding indebtedness. See Notes N and V of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding asset divestitures. Oil and gas production costs. The Company recorded production costs of $449.3 million, $316.1 million and $228.2 million during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In general, lease operating expenses and workover expenses represent the components of oil and gas production costs over which the Company has management control, while production taxes and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes. Total production costs per BOE increased during 2005 by 44 percent as compared to 2004 primarily due to (i) an increase 43 Table of Contents in production and ad valorem taxes as a result of higher commodity prices, (ii) higher Canadian gas transportation fees, (iii) the retention of operating costs related to VPP volumes sold (approximately $.19 per BOE, during 2005), (iv) new production added from the Evergreen merger which are relatively higher per BOE operating cost properties, (v) decreased production from the lower per BOE production cost deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets and (v) increases in equipment and service costs associated with rising commodity prices. Total production costs per BOE increased during 2004 by 13 percent as compared to 2003. The increase in total production costs per BOE during 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily attributable to increases in production volumes and a greater proportion of those volumes coming from the Sable oil field in South Africa, the Devils Tower oil and gas field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and, to a lesser extent, the new production added with the Evergreen merger which are higher operating cost properties. The following tables provide the components of the Companys total production costs per BOE from continuing operations and total production costs per BOE from continuing operations by geographic area for 2005, 2004 and 2003: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Lease operating expenses $ 5.07 $ 3.63 $ 3.14 Taxes: Ad valorem .63 .43 .41 Production .97 .61 .62 Workover costs .34 .21 .14 Total production costs $ 7.01 $ 4.88 $ 4.31 Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 United States $ 7.41 $ 4.87 $ 4.44 Argentina $ 3.26 $ 2.99 $ 2.78 Canada $ 14.83 $ 10.79 $ 9.21 Africa $ 8.82 $ 7.37 $ 3.99 Worldwide $ 7.01 $ 4.88 $ 4.31 Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense. The Companys total depletion, depreciation and amortization (DD&A) expense was $8.86, $8.56 and $7.07 per BOE for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Depletion expense, the largest component of DD&A expense, was $8.53, $8.38 and $6.89 per BOE during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. During 2005, the increase in per BOE depletion expense was primarily due to relatively higher per BOE cost basis Rocky Mountain area production acquired in the Evergreen merger and a higher depletion rate for the Hugoton and Spraberry fields as a result of the VPP volumes sold, partially offset by lower production from higher cost basis Gulf of Mexico production. Additionally, the Companys depletion expense per BOE (i) increased in Argentina due to downward reserve revisions associated with negative well performance and drilling results in its deep gas play in the Neuquen basin, (ii) increased in Tunisia due to the Companys proved reserves being reduced as a result of the Companys interest in the Adam block being reduced to 20 percent from 28 percent in accordance with the terms of the concession and (iii) decreased in South Africa as a result of upward reserve revisions attributable to better well performance. During 2004, the increase in per BOE depletion expense was due to a greater proportion of the Companys production being derived from higher cost basis deepwater Gulf of Mexico and South African developments and downward revisions to proved reserves in Canada in 2003. 44 Table of Contents The following table provides depletion expense per BOE from continuing operations by geographic area for 2005, 2004 and 2003: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 United States $ 8.71 $ 8.62 $ 7.06 Argentina $ 7.13 $ 5.56 $ 4.96 Canada $ 12.71 $ 12.93 $ 11.42 Africa $ 7.96 $ 11.19 $ 10.69 Worldwide $ 8.53 $ 8.38 $ 6.89 Impairment of oil and gas properties. The Company reviews its long lived assets to be held and used, including oil and gas properties, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. During 2005 and 2004, the Company recognized a noncash impairment charge of $.6 million and $39.7 million, respectively, to reduce the carrying value of its Gabonese Olowi field assets as development of the discovery was canceled. See Critical Accounting Estimates below and Notes B and S of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information pertaining to the Companys accounting policies regarding assessments of impairment and the Gabonese Olowi field impairment, respectively. Exploration, abandonments, geological and geophysical costs. The following table provides the Companys geological and geophysical costs, exploratory dry hole expense, lease abandonments and other exploration expense from continuing operations by geographic area for 2005, 2004 and 2003: Africa United and States Argentina Canada Other Total (In thousands) Year ended December 31, 2005: Geological and geophysical $ 66,048 $ 6,603 $ 4,452 $ 34,353 $ 111,456 Exploratory dry holes 61,209 9,257 3,468 18,981 92,915 Leasehold abandonments and other 48,770 8,667 1,625 3,318 62,380 $ 176,027 $ 24,527 $ 9,545 $ 56,652 $ 266,751 Year ended December 31, 2004: Geological and geophysical $ 51,731 $ 11,718 $ 4,047 $ 14,833 $ 82,329 Exploratory dry holes 39,328 7,213 11,131 24,460 82,132 Leasehold abandonments and other 7,925 4,475 3,883 6 16,289 $ 98,984 $ 23,406 $ 19,061 $ 39,299 $ 180,750 Year ended December 31, 2003: Geological and geophysical $ 40,783 $ 7,689 $ 4,426 $ 3,903 $ 56,801 Exploratory dry holes 27,015 2,672 9,868 20,250 59,805 Leasehold abandonments and other 4,941 7,715 1,822 108 14,586 $ 72,739 $ 18,076 $ 16,116 $ 24,261 $ 131,192 Significant components of the Companys dry hole expense during 2005 included $21.2 related to certain suspended Alaskan well costs, $16.7 million associated with an unsuccessful well in the Falcon Corridor, $9.5 million associated with an unsuccessful Nigerian well, $3.5 million attributable to an unsuccessful well on the Companys El Hamra permit in Tunisia, $5.1 million attributable to an unsuccessful suspended well in the Companys Anaguid permit in Tunisia and various other exploratory wells. The United States leasehold abandonments and other costs during the year ended December 31, 2005 include a $39.8 million increase in East Cameron abandonment obligations that resulted from hurricane damage. During 2005, the Company 45 Table of Contents completed and evaluated 180 exploration/extension wells, 149 of which were successfully completed as discoveries. Significant components of the Companys dry hole expense during 2004 included $27.7 million and $10.5 million on the Companys deepwater Gulf of Mexico Juno and Myrtle Beach prospects, respectively, $19.0 million on the Companys Gabonese Olowi prospect and $5.8 million on the Companys Bravo prospect offshore Equatorial Guinea. During 2004, the Company completed and evaluated 103 exploration/extension wells, 58 of which were successfully completed as discoveries. General and administrative expense. General and administrative expense totaled $124.6 million ($1.94 per BOE), $80.3 million ($1.24 per BOE) and $60.3 million ($1.14 per BOE) during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expense during 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to increases in administrative staff, including staff increases associated with the Evergreen merger, and performance related compensation costs including the amortization of restricted stock awarded to officers, directors and employees during 2005. The increase in general and administrative expense during 2004, as compared to 2003, was primarily due to increases in administrative staff, including staff increases associated with the Evergreen merger, and performance related compensation costs including the amortization of restricted stock awarded to officers, directors and employees during 2004. Interest expense. Interest expense was $127.8 million, $103.4 million and $91.4 million during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on the Companys indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 6.5 percent, as compared to 5.4 percent and 5.3 percent for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, including the effects of interest rate derivatives. The increase in interest expense for 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily due to increased average borrowings under the Companys lines of credit, primarily as a result of the cash portion of the consideration paid in the Evergreen merger and $949.3 million of stock repurchases completed during 2005, a $17.3 million decrease in the amortization of interest rate hedge gains, the assumption of $300 million of notes in connection with the Evergreen merger and higher interest rates in 2005. The increase in interest expense for 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily due to a $7.9 million decrease in interest rate hedge gains, a $3.4 million decrease in capitalized interest as the Company completed its major development projects in the Gulf of Mexico and South Africa, increased borrowings under the Companys lines of credit, primarily as a result of the Evergreen merger, and the assumption of $300 million of notes in connection with the Evergreen merger. See Note F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information about the Companys long term debt and interest expense. Other expenses. Other expenses were $112.8 million during 2005, as compared to $33.7 million during 2004 and $21.3 million during 2003. The increase in other expenses during 2005, as compared to 2004, is primarily attributable to a $26.5 million loss on the redemption and tender of portions of the Companys senior notes, a $50.5 million increase in hedge ineffectiveness and a $3.1 million increase in amortization of noncompete agreements associated with the Evergreen merger. The increase in other expense for 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily due to an increase in contingency accrual adjustments of $11.8 million. See Note O of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a detailed description of the components included in other expenses. Income tax benefits (provisions). The Company recognized income tax provisions on continuing operations of $291.7 million and $164.2 million during 2005 and 2004, respectively, and income tax benefits on continuing operations of $67.4 million during 2003. The 2003 deferred United States federal, state and local tax benefits include a $197.7 million benefit from the reversal of the Companys valuation allowances against United States deferred tax assets. 46 Table of Contents The Companys effective tax rate of 40.8 percent for the year ended December 31, 2005 differs from the combined United States federal and state statutory rate of approximately 36.5 percent primarily due to: The second quarter reversal of the $26.9 million tax benefit recorded in 2004 as a result of the cancellation of the development of the Olowi block and the Companys decision to exit Gabon. The Company reversed the tax benefit as a result of signing an agreement in June 2005 to sell its shares in the subsidiary that owns the interest in the Olowi block which made it more likely than not that the Company would not realize the originally recorded tax benefit, The Company recognized a gain of approximately $47.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 relating to the sale of shares in a subsidiary that owns the interest in the Olowi Block located in Gabon. There is no associated income tax effect either in Gabon or the United States associated with the gain, which partially offsets the effects of the previous item, Recording $6.8 million of taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA), Expenses for unsuccessful well costs in foreign locations where the Company receives no expected income tax benefits, Foreign tax rate differentials and Foreign statutes that differ from those in the United States. See Critical Accounting Estimates below and Note P of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the Companys tax position. Discontinued operations. The Company recognized income from discontinued operations of $110.8 million during 2005, as compared to $13.9 million during 2004 and $17.4 million during 2003. During 2005, the Company sold its interests in (a) the Martin Creek, Conroy Black and Lookout Butte areas in Canada for net proceeds of $197.2 million, resulting in a gain of $138.3 million and (b) certain assets on the shelf of the Gulf of Mexico for net proceeds of $59.1 million, resulting in a gain of $27.7 million. In 2005, the Company recognized an income tax provision of $73.1 million associated with these divestitures. Pursuant to SFAS 144, the gain and the results of operations from these assets have been reclassified to discontinued operations. See Note V of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
