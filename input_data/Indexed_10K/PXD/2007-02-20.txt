Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operations" for additional discussions regarding proved reserves and their related cash flows. Proved Reserves The Companys proved reserves totaled 904.9 MMBOE, 986.7 MMBOE and 1.0 billion BOE at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, representing $4.7 billion, $7.3 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively, of Standardized Measure. The Companys proved reserves include field fuel, which is gas consumed to operate field equipment (primarily compressors) prior to the gas being delivered to a sales point. The following table shows the changes in the Companys proved reserve volumes by geographic area during the year ended December 31, 2006 (in MBOE): Purchases of Sales of Revisions of Extensions and Minerals in Minerals in Previous Production Discoveries Place Place Estimates United States.....

Production volumes include 2,894 MBOE of field fuel and 6,811 MBOE of production associated with divested assets being presented as discontinued operations. Extensions and discoveries. Extensions and discoveries are primarily the result of extension drilling in the Raton field and Spraberry field in the United States and the Horseshoe Canyon field in Canada and lower risk exploratory drilling in the Companys South Texas Edwards Trend and Tunisian resource plays. 16 Purchases of minerals in place. Purchases of minerals in place are primarily attributable to bolt on acquisitions and joint venture activities in the Companys Spraberry field and Edwards Trend area. Sales of minerals in place. Sales of minerals in place are principally related to the Companys divestiture of its deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine assets during 2006. See Note N of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data". Revisions of previous estimates. Revisions of previous estimates are comprised of 14 MMBOE of negative price revisions offset by 6 MMBOE of positive technical revisions. The Companys proved reserves at December 31, 2006 were determined using year end NYMEX equivalent prices of $60.82 per barrel of oil and $5.64 per Mcf of gas, compared to $61.04 per barrel of oil and $10.08 per Mcf of gas at December 31, 2005. The lower gas prices at December 31, 2006 decreased the economic life on certain gas properties, the majority of which were in the Raton gas field. On a BOE basis, 60 percent of the Companys total proved reserves at December 31, 2006 were proved developed reserves. Based on reserve information as of December 31, 2006, and using the Companys production information for the year then ended, excluding production associated with divested assets included in discontinued operations, the reserve to production ratio associated with the Companys proved reserves was in excess of 20 years on a BOE basis.

Description of Properties United States Approximately 89 percent of the Companys proved reserves at December 31, 2006 are located in the Spraberry field in the Permian Basin area, the Hugoton and West Panhandle fields in the Mid Continent area and the Raton field in the Rocky Mountains area. These fields generate substantial operating cash flow and the Spraberry and Raton fields have a large portfolio of low risk drilling opportunities. The cash flows generated from these fields provide funding for the Companys other development and exploration activities both domestically and internationally.

Permian Basin Spraberry field. The Spraberry field was discovered in 1949 and encompasses eight counties in West Texas. The field is approximately 150 miles long and 75 miles wide at its widest point. The oil produced is West Texas Intermediate Sweet, and the gas produced is casinghead gas with an average energy content of 1,400 Btu. The oil and gas are produced primarily from three formations, the upper and lower Spraberry and the Dean, at depths ranging from 6,700 feet to 9,200 feet. In addition, the Company has started completing the majority of its wells in the Wolfcamp formation at depths ranging from 9,300 feet to 10,300 feet with successful results. The Company believes the Spraberry field offers excellent opportunities to enhance oil and gas production because of the numerous undeveloped drilling locations, many of which are reflected in the Companys proved undeveloped reserves, and the ability to contain operating expenses through economies of scale. During 2006, the Company (a) drilled 299 wells, an increase of 118 wells over 2005, (b) acquired approximately 200,000 gross acres, bringing its total acreage position to approximately 684,000 gross acres (593,000 net acres), (c) completed several bolt on property acquisitions and joint ventures, (d) successfully drilled a majority of the wells to the Wolfcamp formation and (e) acquired a well servicing operation as a measure to control costs. Mid Continent Hugoton field. The Hugoton field in southwest Kansas is one of the largest producing gas fields in the continental United States. The gas is produced from the Chase and Council Grove formations at depths ranging from 2,700 feet to 3,000 feet. The Companys gas in the Hugoton field has an average energy content of 1,025 Btu. The Companys Hugoton properties are located on approximately 285,000 gross acres (247,000 net acres), covering approximately 400 square miles. The Company has working interests in approximately 1,200 wells in the Hugoton field, about 1,000 of which it operates, and partial royalty interests in approximately 500 wells. The Company owns substantially all of the gathering and processing facilities, primarily the Satanta plant, that service its production from the Hugoton field. Such ownership allows the Company to control the production, gathering, processing and sale of its gas and NGL production. The Companys Hugoton operated wells are capable of producing approximately 69 MMcf of wet gas per day (i.e., gas production at the wellhead before processing or field fuel use and before reduction for royalties), although actual production in the Hugoton field is limited by allowables set by state regulators. The Company estimates that it and other major producers in the Hugoton field produced near allowable capacity during the year ended December 31, 2006. 19 During 2006, the Company reached a settlement agreement on the class action Alford royalty lawsuit which primarily revolved around costs being charged to the royalty owners. The settlement agreement provides for adjustment to the manner in which royalty payments will be calculated and accordingly, the Company expects a small increase in its production costs beginning in 2007. See Note I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data". West Panhandle field. The West Panhandle properties are located in the panhandle region of Texas. These stable, long lived reserves are attributable to the Red Cave, Brown Dolomite, Granite Wash and fractured Granite formations at depths no greater than 3,500 feet. The Companys gas in the West Panhandle field has an average energy content of 1,300 Btu and is produced from approximately 600 wells on more than 250,000 gross acres (240,000 net acres) covering over 375 square miles. The Company controls 100 percent of the wells, production equipment, gathering system and gas processing plant for the field. The Company is pursuing regulatory relief in the West Panhandle field to allow for future additional drilling locations. Rocky Mountains Raton field. The Raton Basin properties are located in the southeast portion of Colorado. Exploration for CBM in the Raton Basin began in the late 1970s and continued through the late 1980s, with several companies drilling and testing more than 100 wells during this period. The absence of a pipeline to transport gas from the Raton Basin prevented full scale development until January 1995, when Colorado Interstate Gas Company completed the construction of the Picketwire lateral pipeline system. The Companys gas in the Raton Basin has an average energy content of 1,000 Btu. Since the completion of the Picketwire lateral, production has continued to grow, resulting in expansion of the systems capacity by its operator, the most recent expansion of which was in October 2005. The Company owns approximately 317,000 gross acres (281,000 net acres) in the center of the Raton Basin with current production from coal seams of the Vermejo and Raton formations. The Company owns the well servicing and frac equipment that it utilizes in the Raton field to control costs and insure availability. During 2006, the Company (a) drilled 288 wells, (b) added wellhead compression and (c) continued efforts to optimize gathering and compression facilities. Piceance/Uinta Basins. The Piceance Basin is located in the central portion of western Colorado, and the Uinta Basin is located in the central portion of eastern Utah. The Company owns approximately 244,000 gross acres covering producing and prospective regions of the Piceance and Uinta Basins. Currently, production is established from various tight sandstone, coal and shale formations. The Companys significant projects in the area are CBM plays at Columbine Springs and Castlegate and a deep gas play at Main Canyon. At Columbine Springs, in northwest Colorado, the Company is completing its extension pilot program, with all wells expected to be on production by the end of the first quarter of 2007. If the pilot project is successful in achieving commercial quantities of gas production, full field development could begin in 2008. In northeast Utah, the Company continues to monitor its CBM pilot at Castlegate and is testing the wells recently drilled in the Main Canyon area. An assessment of whether either project will be commercial is not expected until the second half of 2007. Sand Wash Basin. The Sand Wash Basin is the site of a potential CBM project located north of the Companys Piceance Basin properties. The Company holds a 50 percent operated interest in 114,000 gross acres in the Lay Creek field. At Lay Creek, the Company has drilled 15 wells in five separate pilot areas and completed workovers and recompletions on 14 wells drilled by a previous operator. The Company has completed the water treatment facility and plans to initiate production in the first quarter of 2007. If the pilot projects are successful in achieving commercial quantities of gas production, full field development could begin in 2008. 20 Gulf of Mexico Gulf of Mexico area. During March 2006, the Company sold all of its interests in certain oil and gas properties in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for net proceeds of $1.2 billion, resulting in a gain of $726.2 million. See Notes N and V of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a description of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico divestiture. During 2005, the Company announced a discovery on its Clipper prospect in the Green Canyon Blocks 299 and 300 in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. During 2006, the Company drilled two successful Clipper appraisal wells, but drilled an unsuccessful exploratory well at the Flying Cloud prospect, a prospect near the Clipper discovery. The Company expects to develop the Clipper discovery and is currently evaluating sub sea tie back options to third party production handling facilities in the area. Pioneer operates the Clipper discovery with a 55 percent working interest. As a result of Hurricane Rita, the Companys East Cameron facility, located on the Gulf of Mexico shelf, was destroyed and the Company does not plan to rebuild the facility based on the economics of the field. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Companys application to "reef in place" a substantial portion of the East Cameron debris was denied. As a result, the Company currently estimates that it will cost approximately $119 million to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron facility. The estimate to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron facility is based upon an analysis and fee proposal prepared by a third party engineering firm for the majority of the work and an estimate by the Company for the remainder. During 2006 and 2005, the Company recorded additional abandonment obligation charges of $75.0 million and $39.8 million, respectively, which amounts are included in hurricane activity, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The operations to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron facilities began in January 2007 and the Company expects to incur a substantial portion of the costs in 2007. The Company expects that a substantial portion of the total estimated cost to reclaim and abandon the facility will be covered by insurance, including 100 percent of the debris removal costs. Consequently, the Company has recorded a $43.0 million insurance recovery receivable corresponding to the estimated debris removal costs. During 2006, the Company announced its intent to divest of its Gulf of Mexico shelf properties; however, the Company has decided not to divest of these properties after its sales efforts in 2006 did not result in an acceptable offer. Onshore Gulf Coast South Texas. The Company has historically focused its drilling efforts in South Texas on the Pawnee field in the Edwards Trend in South Texas. The Edwards Trend is a tight gas limestone reservoir characterized by narrow bands of dry gas fields extending over 250 miles. The Company has acquired over 270,000 gross acres in the Edwards Trend. In addition to the operations in the Pawnee field, the Company has operations in the SW Kenedy and Washburn fields. Production depths in the Edwards Trend range from 9,500 feet to 14,000 feet. During 2006, the Company drilled 16 exploration and appraisal wells targeting new field discoveries in the Edwards Trend area with 88 percent success, exceeding expectations and increasing proved gas reserves. Eight new wells have been added to production and six wells are awaiting pipelines or testing. Having 3 D seismic data has significantly enhanced field development in the Pawnee field, allowing the Company to more accurately locate and orient the horizontal wells for optimal results. To expand its 3 D data coverage to include new discoveries and additional prospects, the Company plans to shoot and interpret approximately 850 square miles of new data. Multiple surveys are planned for 2007, with three already underway. While the new seismic work is being completed, the Company will direct most of its investments in the Edwards Trend to lower risk, lower cost development drilling on existing discoveries where 3 D data is currently available. To revitalize existing horizontal wells in the area, the Company has initiated a pilot using more extensive fracture stimulation techniques. Horizontal wells in the field are completed open hole and have traditionally been lightly stimulated with acid. Recently, the Company began performing a new fracture stimulation procedure on additional wells. The Company plans to 21 fracture stimulate additional horizontal wells, including newer producing wells, during 2007 to further evaluate the potential for a more extensive program. The Company also recently drilled a new horizontal well within a developed section of the Pawnee field with very successful results. The Company is currently evaluating additional infill drilling locations given this success. Plans are also in progress to expand the gas gathering infrastructure in the area to accommodate expected production growth and to maximize efficiency at the Companys Pawnee Plant. Northern Louisiana and Mississippi. The Company has acquired significant acreage in Northern Louisiana and Mississippi. The Company has built an acreage position covering multiple plays in the Mississippi Salt Basin and now holds leases and option interests covering over 300,000 acres. Over the next two to three years, the Company expects to test a number of opportunities and to continue technical work that is currently underway. One of the lower risk opportunities in the portfolio is the redevelopment of the Bolton Gas Field in Hinds County, Mississippi. The first well of the project was drilled to 17,600 feet and penetrated multiple gas bearing Cotton Valley sands. Currently, the well is being logged and completion design work is progressing. The location for the next well has been built and drilling will commence immediately after operations are completed on the current well. The Company plans to drill at least one more well in 2007 during this initial phase of the project. Facility construction is underway and first production is anticipated in mid 2007. The Company has also concluded drilling operations on its first well testing the Norphlet formation in Mississippi. The well was drilled in Wayne County and, after extensive evaluation, has been plugged and abandoned. Future drilling plans will be determined after a technical analysis of the initial well is completed. Alaska Oooguruk. During 2002, the Company acquired a 70 percent working interest and operatorship in ten state leases on Alaskas North Slope. In connection therewith, the Company drilled three exploratory wells during 2003 to test a possible extension of the productive sands in the Kuparuk River field in the shallow waters offshore the North Slope of Alaska. Although all three of the wells found the sands filled with oil, they were too thin to be considered commercial on a stand alone basis. However, the wells also encountered thick sections of oil bearing Jurassic aged sands, and the first well flowed at a rate of approximately 1,300 Bbls per day. In January 2004, the Company farmed into a large acreage block to the southwest of the Companys discovery. In 2004, Pioneer completed an extensive technical and economic evaluation of the resource potential within this area. As a result of this evaluation, the Company performed front end engineering and permitting activities during 2005 to further define the scope of the project. In early 2006, the Company announced that it had approved the development of the Oooguruk field in the project area. The Company has constructed and armored the gravel drilling and production island site and installation of a sub sea flowline and facilities are planned for 2007 to carry produced liquids to existing onshore processing facilities at the Kuparuk River Unit. The Company continues to procure equipment and services, fabricate equipment and modify a drilling rig for installation in 2007. Development drilling of approximately 40 wells on the project is expected to begin in late 2007 and be completed in 2009. First production is expected in 2008. Cosmopolitan. During 2005, Pioneer announced that it entered into an agreement on the Cosmopolitan Unit in the Cook Inlet. Under this agreement, Pioneer earned a ten percent working interest in the unit from ConocoPhillips through a disproportionate spending arrangement for a 3 D seismic program undertaken during the fourth quarter of 2005. In June 2006, the Company exercised an option to acquire an additional 40 percent working interest in the Cosmopolitan Unit, bringing its working interest to 50 percent. Pioneer was elected operator of the Cosmopolitan Unit and plans to drill an appraisal well in 2007. Onshore North Slope area. The Company holds a large acreage position in the onshore North Slope area of Alaska, primarily in the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska ("NPRA"). During the 2006 2007 drilling season, the Company plans to participate in the drilling of two non operated exploratory wells in the NPRA. 22 International The Companys international operations are located in Canada, offshore South Africa and in southern Tunisia. Additionally, the Company has exploration activities West Africa (Equatorial Guinea and Nigeria). As of December 31, 2006, approximately three percent and two percent of the Companys proved reserves were located in Canada and Africa, respectively.

Argentina. During April 2006, the Company sold its Argentine assets for net proceeds of $669.6 million, resulting in a gain of $10.9 million. See Notes N and V of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a description of the Argentine divestiture. 23 Canada. The Companys Canadian producing properties are located primarily in Alberta and British Columbia, Canada. The Company continues to exploit lower risk opportunities identified in the Chinchaga field in northeast British Columbia and Alberta. Production from the Chinchaga field is relatively dry gas from formation depths averaging 3,400 feet. The Company has commenced production and continued significant drilling, pipeline and facility activities in south central Alberta targeting Horseshoe Canyon CBM in the greater Drumheller area. The greater Drumheller area produces gas, condensate and minor oil from Cretaceous to Devonian formations at depths ranging from 400 to 6,500 feet. Also, in southern Alberta the Company has initiated a CBM pilot in the Mannville coals. Currently, six wells have been drilled and are in the dewatering stages to see if commercial quantities of gas can be achieved. The Company is also evaluating other completion techniques that could potentially accelerate the dewatering and increase production rates. South Africa. The Company has agreements to explore for oil and gas offshore South Africa covering over 3.6 million acres along the southern coast in water depths generally less than 650 feet. The Sable oil field began producing in August 2003 and the majority of the gas from the field has been reinjected. The Company has a 40 percent working interest in the Sable field. In 2005, the Company sanctioned the non operated South Coast Gas development project, which includes the sub sea tie back of gas from the Sable field and six additional gas accumulations to an existing production facility on the F A platform for transportation via existing pipelines to a gas to liquids plant. Pioneer has a 45 percent working interest in the project. As part of sanctioning of the South Coast Gas project, the Company signed a six year contract for the sale of all of its gas and condensate production from the project. The contract contains an obligation for the purchaser to take or pay for a total of 91.4 BCF and associated condensate if the anticipated deliverability estimates are achieved. The price for both gas and condensate is indexed to Brent oil sales. During 2006, the Company drilled four wells. During the first half of 2007, the Company plans to drill two additional development wells and complete the sub sea well tie backs to the existing production facilities on the F A platform. First production is expected to commence in the second half of 2007. Tunisia. The Companys Tunisian exploration permits can be separated into three categories: (i) two exploration permits (Jenein Nord and El Hamra) covering 1.6 million acres which the Company operates with a 100 percent working interest, (ii) the Anadarko operated Anaguid exploration permit covering over 1.2 million acres in which the Company has a 45 percent working interest and (iii) the ENI operated Adam Concession and Borj El Khadra exploration permit covering approximately 212,000 acres and 970,000 acres, respectively, in which the Company has a 20 percent and 40 percent working interest, respectively. All exploration permits and concessions are onshore southern Tunisia. Production from the Adam Concession began in May 2003. During 2006, the Company continued its exploratory and appraisal activities on the Adam Concession by drilling four wells, of which three were successful, and completed a 3 D seismic survey. In 2006, the Companys interest in the Adam Concession was reduced from 24 percent to 20 percent in accordance with the terms of the concession. At December 31, 2006, the Company had an exploratory well in progress on each of the Adam Concession and Borj El Khadra block. Both wells were successful and are being added to production in the first quarter of 2007. The Company plans to drill an additional two to three wells in the concession during 2007. In 2006, the Company acquired the remaining equity interest in the Jenein Nord block that it did not already own and became the operator of the block. During 2006, the Company completed a 3 D seismic survey on the Jenein Nord block. The Company drilled an exploratory well during 2006 that encountered multiple oil bearing zones and its commercial development is being analyzed. At December 31, 2006, the Company had an additional exploratory well in progress which was successful. The Company plans to drill one to two additional wells in the block during 2007. After the performance of the wells has been monitored for several months, additional exploration and appraisal wells may also be drilled. 24 Recently, the Company entered into a farm out agreement of its interest in the El Hamra block pursuant to which it retained an economic interest in the block. In the Anaguid block, the Company continues to evaluate the results of its past drilling on the block and other blocks in the area to determine the go forward plans on the block. West Africa The Company previously disclosed that it had retained a third party adviser to assist it in marketing its West Africa assets. No agreement to sell these assets has been reached to date, but the Company continues to consider interest from potential purchasers. As such, the capital budget includes amounts for expected drilling activities in West Africa during 2007. A first well is expected to spud during the second quarter of 2007, with drilling on a second well expected to commence in the second half of 2007, both in deepwater Nigeria. The timing of the drilling of a third well is uncertain and therefore no amounts have been budgeted for this prospect in 2007. Equatorial Guinea. The Company owns a 50 percent working interest in Block H located in the northern Rio Muni Basin of Equatorial Guinea. The block covers an area of over 240,000 acres and water depth ranging from 300 meters in the southeastern corner of the block to over 1,800 meters near the western block boundary. Currently, as a result of new hydrocarbon law in Equatorial Guinea, the government in Equatorial Guinea is claiming an additional participation interest in the block. The Company is evaluating the effect of the claim with the operator of the block. The Company has identified several prospects on the block that are being evaluated for future drilling. In light of the governments claim, the timing of drilling a well is uncertain. Nigeria. A partially owned subsidiary of the Company joined Oranto Petroleum and Orandi Petroleum in an existing production sharing contract on Block 320 in deepwater Nigeria gaining exploration rights from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. The subsidiary, which holds a 51 percent interest in Block 320, is owned 59 percent by the Company and 41 percent by an unaffiliated third party. The Company completed a 3 D seismic survey covering the block in 2006. The Company currently expects to drill the first exploration well on the block in the second half of 2007. The Company owns a 25 percent working interest in Devon Energy operated Block 256 offshore Nigeria. During the first quarter of 2006, the Company participated in the drilling of the Pina 1 X well on Block 256 in the deepwater of Nigeria, which was unsuccessful. The partners plan to drill an additional well on Block 256 in the second quarter of 2007 to test a different type of play. Selected Oil and Gas Information The following tables set forth selected oil and gas information from continuing operations for the Company as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Because of normal production declines, increased or decreased drilling activities and the effects of acquisitions or divestitures, the historical information presented below should not be interpreted as being indicative of future results. 25 Production, price and cost data. The following tables set forth production, price and cost data with respect to the Companys properties for 2006, 2005 and 2004. These amounts represent the Companys historical results from continuing operations without making pro forma adjustments for any acquisitions, divestitures or drilling activity that occurred during the respective years. The production amounts will not agree to the reserve volume tables in the "Unaudited Supplementary Information" section included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" due to field fuel volumes and production from discontinued operations being included in the reserve volume tables.

In Tunisia, the Company either has received extensions, plans to make the necessary expenditures to extend the acreage or intends to seek extensions on the 2007 expirations. As to the remaining acreage the Company may extend the leases prior to their expiration based upon 2007 planned activities or for other business reasons. In certain leases, the extension is only subject to the Companys election to extend and the fulfillment of certain capital expenditures commitments. In other cases, the extensions are subject to the consent of third parties, and no assurance can be given that the requested extensions will be granted. See "Description of Properties" above for information regarding the Companys drilling operations. Drilling activities. The following table sets forth the number of gross and net productive and dry hole wells in which the Company had an interest that were drilled during 2006, 2005 and 2004. This information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there was any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled and the oil and gas reserves generated thereby or the costs to the Company of productive wells compared to the costs of dry holes. 30 DRILLING ACTIVITIES Gross Wells Net Wells Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 United States: Productive wells: Development............ 662 537 268 619 505 243 Exploratory............ 52 40 8 42 37 5 Dry holes: Development............ 8 7 3 7 7 3 Exploratory............ 8 7 6 6 5 3 730 591 285 674 554 254 Argentina: Productive wells: Development............ 14 65 43 14 64 42 Exploratory............ 4 19 21 4 18 21 Dry holes: Development............ 1 4 1 1 4 1 Exploratory............ 2 14 10 2 14 10 21 102 75 21 100 74 Canada: Productive wells: Development............ 2 27 3 2 26 3 Exploratory............ 326 87 27 297 72 25 Dry holes: Development............

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Strategic Initiatives and Goals During 2006, the Company accomplished significant goals underlying the strategic initiatives established in 2005 to enhance shareholder value and investment returns. Together with other important accomplishments, the Company: o Substantially completed a $1 billion share repurchase program, $640.7 million of which was completed during 2005 and $345.3 million of which was completed during 2006 o Completed the divestiture of the Companys assets in Argentina for net proceeds of $669.6 million, resulting in a gain of $10.9 million o Completed the divestiture of the Companys assets in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for net proceeds of $1.2 billion, resulting in a gain of $726.2 million o Reduced higher risk, higher impact exploration spending to approximately five percent of the total capital spent in 2006 o Focused capital spending on lower risk North American onshore development and extension drilling o Produced 35.9 MMBOE in 2006 from continuing operations o Increased the semi annual dividend to shareholders to $0.13 per share Financial and Operating Performance Pioneers financial and operating performance for 2006 included the following highlights: o Average daily sales volumes, on a BOE basis, decreased three percent in 2006 as compared to 2005, primarily due to a 126 percent increase in the delivery of VPP volumes. Excluding the delivery of the VPP volumes in 2006 (5.6 MMBOE) and 2005 (2.5 MMBOE), the Companys North American production increased approximately nine percent, which the Company believes provides a better understanding of the actual results of the Companys 2006 North American drilling program excluding the increased VPP deliveries. o Oil and gas revenues increased nine percent in 2006 as compared to 2005, primarily as a result of increases in worldwide oil and NGL prices. o Net income increased 38 percent to $739.7 million ($5.81 per diluted share) in 2006 from $534.6 million ($3.80 per diluted share) in 2005, primarily on the strength of higher oil and NGL prices and gains on the sale of deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine assets. o Income from continuing operations decreased to $172.3 million ($1.36 per diluted share) for 2006, as compared to $194.7 million ($1.40 per diluted share) for 2005, primarily due to higher exploration and abandonment expenses in 2006. o The Company recognized income from discontinued operations of $567.4 million ($4.45 per diluted share) during 2006, primarily attributable to the sale of deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine assets, as compared to income from discontinued operations of $339.9 million ($2.40 per diluted share) during 2005. 36 o Outstanding debt decreased to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2006 as compared to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2005, primarily due to the application of sales proceeds from the Companys divestment of its assets in Argentina and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. o The Companys debt to capitalization was 33 percent at December 31, 2006 as compared to 48 percent at December 31, 2005. o Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $522.3 million, or 41 percent as compared to that of 2005, primarily due to the sale of deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine assets during 2006 and Canadian and Gulf of Mexico shelf assets during 2005. o The Company added 91 MMBOE of proved reserves during 2006, resulting in total proved reserves of 904.9 MMBOE at December 31, 2006. 2007 Outlook and Activities Commodity prices. Significant factors that may impact 2007 commodity prices include developments in the issues currently impacting Iraq and Iran and the Middle East in general; the extent to which members of the OPEC and other oil exporting nations are able to continue to manage oil supply through export quotas; and overall North American gas supply and demand fundamentals, including the impact of increasing LNG deliveries to the United States. Although the Company cannot predict the occurrence of events that may affect 2007 commodity prices or the degree to which these prices will be affected, the prices for any commodity that the Company produces will generally approximate current market prices in the geographic region of the production. Pioneer will continue to strategically hedge a portion of its oil and gas price risk to mitigate the impact of price volatility on its oil, NGL and gas revenues. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys commodity hedge positions at December 31, 2006. Also see "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for disclosures about the Companys commodity related derivative financial instruments. Capital budget for 2007. The Company announced a 2007 capital budget of $1.1 billion, excluding acquisitions, effects of asset retirement obligations, capitalized interest and geological and geophysical administrative costs. The 2007 capital budget is allocated (i) 50 percent to low risk development drilling in onshore North American core areas, (ii) 25 percent to the development of the South African South Coast Gas and Alaskan Oooguruk projects, (iii) 20 percent to test and develop lower risk resource plays in onshore North America and Tunisia and (iv) 5 percent to high impact exploration activities in the United States and West Africa. The Company plans to drill and recomplete approximately 650 to 700 wells during 2007. 2007 Annual Production. The Company believes that the results from its 2006 drilling program and 2007 capital budget will allow the Company to realize production growth during 2007 of 10 percent or more as compared to the Companys 2006 production. First Quarter 2007 Outlook. Based on current estimates, the Company expects that first quarter 2007 production will average 97,000 to 102,000 BOEPD. The range reflects the typical variability in the timing of oil cargo shipments in South Africa and Tunisia and the recent downtime related to severe winter weather in the Companys Rockies and Mid Continent areas, which is expected to reduce first quarter production by approximately 3,000 BOEPD. First quarter production costs (including production and ad valorem taxes and transportation costs) are expected to average $11.25 to $12.25 per BOE based on current NYMEX strip prices for oil and gas, reduced production due to weather downtime and increased weather related repair costs. Depletion, depreciation and amortization ("DD&A") expense is expected to average $10.00 to $11.00 per BOE. Total exploration and abandonment expense for the quarter is expected to be $50 million to $90 million including (i) up to $25 million from high impact drilling on Alaskas North Slope, (ii) up to $30 million from activities in the Companys resource plays in the Edwards Trend in South Texas, Uinta/Piceance in 37 the Rockies area, Canada and Tunisia, (iii) $30 million in seismic investments and personnel costs, primarily related to the resource plays the Company is currently progressing and (iv) $5 million related to acreage and other costs. General and administrative expense is expected to be $30 million to $35 million. Interest expense is expected to be $25 million to $28 million. Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations is expected to be $1 million to $2 million. The Companys first quarter effective income tax rate is expected to range from 37 percent to 45 percent based on current capital spending plans and higher tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions. Cash income taxes are expected to range from $5 million to $15 million, principally related to Tunisian income taxes. Share repurchase programs. In February 2007, the Company announced that the Board approved a new share repurchase program that authorizes the purchase of up to $300 million of the Companys common stock. This share repurchase program follows the Companys previous share repurchase programs of $1 billion and $300 million, which were essentially completed during 2006 and 2005, respectively. Acquisitions 2006 acquisition expenditures. During 2006, the Company spent approximately $223.2 million to acquire proved and unproved properties, which was comprised of approximately $144.8 million of proved properties and $78.3 million of unproved properties. The proved properties were primarily bolt on and acreage acquisitions in the Spraberry field and Edwards Trend area. In North America, the acquisition of unproved properties is comprised of acreage acquisitions in the Spraberry field, Edwards Trend area, Rockies area, Alaska and Canada. The Company also acquired an additional interest in its Jenein Nord block in Tunisia and recognized additional obligations associated with its Nigerian prospects during 2006. 2005 acquisition expenditures. In July 2005, the Company completed the acquisition of approximately 70 MMBOE of substantially proved undeveloped oil reserves in the United States core areas of the Permian Basin and South Texas for $176.9 million. 2004 Evergreen merger. On September 28, 2004, Pioneer completed a merger with Evergreen Resources, Inc. ("Evergreen"). Pioneer acquired the common stock of Evergreen for a total purchase price of approximately $1.8 billion, which was comprised of cash and Pioneer common stock. Divestitures Argentina and Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. During March 2006, the Company sold its interests in certain oil and gas properties in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for net proceeds of $1.2 billion, resulting in a gain of $726.2 million. During April 2006, the Company sold its Argentine assets for net proceeds of $669.6 million, resulting in a gain of $10.9 million. The historic results of these properties and the related gains on disposition are reported as discontinued operations. Volumetric production payments. During January 2005, the Company sold 20.5 MMBOE of proved reserves in the Hugoton and Spraberry fields, by means of two VPPs for net proceeds of $592.3 million, including the assignment of the Companys obligations under certain derivative hedge agreements. During April 2005, the Company sold 7.3 MMBOE of proved reserves in the Spraberry field, by means of a VPP for net proceeds of $300.3 million, including the value attributable to certain derivative hedge agreements assigned to the buyer of the April VPP. The Companys VPPs represent limited term overriding royalty interests in oil and gas reserves which: (i) entitle the purchaser to receive production volumes over a period of time from specific lease interests; (ii) are free and clear of all associated future production costs and capital expenditures; (iii) are nonrecourse to the Company (i.e., the purchasers only recourse is to the assets acquired); (iv) transfers title of the assets to the purchaser and (v) allows the Company to retain the assets after the VPPs volumetric quantities have been delivered. 38 Canada and Shelf Gulf of Mexico. During 2005, the Company sold its interests in the Martin Creek and Conroy Black areas of northeast British Columbia and the Lookout Butte area of southern Alberta for net proceeds of $197.2 million, resulting in a gain of $138.3 million. During 2005, the Company also sold all of its interests in certain oil and gas properties on the Gulf of Mexico shelf for net proceeds of $59.2 million, resulting in a gain of $27.9 million. The historic results of these properties and the related gains on disposition are reported as discontinued operations. Gabon divestiture. In 2005, the Company closed the sale of the shares in a Gabonese subsidiary that owns the interest in the Olowi block for $47.9 million of net proceeds, resulting in a gain of $47.5 million with no associated income tax effect either in Gabon or the United States. In addition, Pioneer retains the potential, under certain circumstances, to receive additional payments for production discovered from deeper reservoirs on the block, if any. Results of Operations Oil and gas revenues. Oil and gas revenues totaled $1.6 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.0 billion during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The revenue increase during 2006, as compared to 2005, was due to a 69 percent increase in reported oil prices, including the effects of commodity price hedges and VPP deliveries, and an 11 percent increase in NGL prices. Partially offsetting the effects of increased oil and NGL prices was an 11 percent decrease in reported gas prices, including the effects of commodity price hedges and VPP deliveries, and a three percent decrease in average daily sales volumes on a BOE basis. The revenue increase during 2005, as compared to 2004, was due to a 19 percent increase in reported oil prices, a 27 percent increase in NGL prices and a 42 percent increase in reported gas prices, including the effects of commodity price hedges and VPP deliveries, along with increased production in 2005 on a BOE basis. A significant factor contributing to the increases in reported oil prices and decreases in reported oil sales volumes in 2006 as compared to 2005 was the initiation of first deliveries of oil volumes under the Companys VPP agreements in January 2006. Similarly, reported gas prices and decreases in gas sales volumes in 2006 and 2005 as compared to 2004 were impacted by the initiation of first deliveries of gas volumes under the Companys VPP agreements during the first half of 2005 offset by the decline in underlying gas prices. In accordance with GAAP, VPP deliveries result in VPP deferred revenue amortization being recognized in oil and gas revenues with no associated sales volumes being recorded. 39 The following table provides average daily sales volumes from continuing operations, including the effects of delivery of the VPP volumes, by geographic area and in total, for 2006, 2005 and 2004: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Oil (Bbls): United States.................. 17,716 21,942 21,863 Canada......................... 311 210 72 South Africa................... 4,127 6,588 9,368 Tunisia........................ 2,386 3,477 2,308 Worldwide...................... 24,540 32,217 33,611 NGLs (Bbls): United States.................. 18,488 17,403 19,678 Canada......................... 463 503 425 Worldwide...................... 18,951 17,906 20,103 Gas (Mcf): United States.................. 284,732 271,033 209,371 Canada......................... 43,420 36,427 25,606 South Africa...................

Average daily per BOE production for 2005, as compared to 2004, increased by 11 percent and 42 percent in the United States and Canada, respectively, and decreased by 14 percent in Africa. Average daily production in the United States was slightly lower during 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily due to a 126 percent increase in VPP oil and gas deliveries on a BOE basis, partially offset by accelerated development drilling in core areas. The increase in United States production volumes during 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to production from properties acquired in the Evergreen merger, partially offset by first deliveries of VPP gas volumes during 2005. Canadian average daily sales volumes increased during 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily due to the significant drilling activity in the CBM Horseshoe Canyon area. The increase in Canadian production volumes during 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to new production from Canadian properties acquired in the Evergreen merger and production from new wells drilled during the 2004 2005 winter drilling program. Production declined in Africa during 2006 and 2005 primarily due to (i) normal production declines from producing properties in South Africa and Tunisia, partially offset by drilling success in Tunisia and (ii) the Companys interest in the Adam Concession in Tunisia being reduced in 2006 from 24 percent to 20 percent in accordance with the terms of the concession agreement. In Tunisia, the Company recorded gas sales volumes and revenue for the first time after finalizing a gas sales arrangement during 2006. 40 The following table provides average daily sales volumes from discontinued operations during 2006, 2005 and 2004: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Oil (Bbls): United States..................... 2,400 5,280 4,774 Argentina......................... 2,515 7,869 8,534 Canada............................ 28 65 Worldwide......................... 4,915 13,177 13,373 NGLs (Bbls): United States..................... 65 60 Argentina......................... 421 1,824 1,546 Canada............................ 112 492 Worldwide......................... 421 2,001 2,098 Gas (Mcf): United States..................... 36,038 230,171 312,468 Argentina......................... 43,905 137,032 121,654 Canada............................ 14 6,489 16,261 Worldwide......................... 79,957 373,692 450,383 Total (BOE): United States..................... 8,406 43,707 56,912 Argentina......................... 10,253 32,531 30,356 Canada............................ 2 1,221 3,267 Worldwide......................... 18,661 77,459 90,535 41 The following table provides average reported prices from continuing operations, including the results of hedging activities and the amortization of VPP deferred revenue, and average realized prices from continuing operations, excluding the results of hedging activities and the amortization of VPP deferred revenue, by geographic area and in total, for 2006, 2005 and 2004: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Average reported prices: Oil (per Bbl): United States........................ $ 65.73 $ 32.01 $ 29.53 Canada............................... $ 65.57 $ 52.12 $ 48.37 South Africa......................... $ 65.92 $ 53.01 $ 37.87 Tunisia.............................. $ 63.16 $ 52.98 $ 39.14 Worldwide............................ $ 65.51 $ 38.70 $ 32.56 NGL (per Bbl): United States........................ $ 35.24 $ 31.72 $ 25.05 Canada............................... $ 51.47 $ 45.79 $ 32.03 Worldwide............................ $ 35.64 $ 32.12 $ 25.20 Gas (per Mcf): United States........................ $ 6.15 $ 6.94 $ 4.99 Canada............................... $ 6.75 $ 7.67 $ 4.72 Tunisia.............................. $ 5.97 $ $ Worldwide............................ $ 6.23 $ 7.02 $ 4.96 Average realized prices: Oil (per Bbl): United States........................ $ 62.92 $ 54.05 $ 39.22 Canada............................... $ 65.57 $ 52.12 $ 48.37 South Africa......................... $ 65.74 $ 53.01 $ 38.60 Tunisia.............................. $ 63.16 $ 52.98 $ 39.14 Worldwide............................ $ 63.45 $ 53.71 $ 39.06 NGL (per Bbl): United States........................ $ 35.24 $ 31.72 $ 25.05 Canada............................... $ 51.47 $ 45.79 $ 32.03 Worldwide............................ $ 35.64 $ 32.12 $ 25.20 Gas (per Mcf): United States........................ $ 5.96 $ 7.26 $ 5.46 Canada............................... $ 6.61 $ 7.67 $ 5.37 Tunisia.............................. $ 5.97 $ $ Worldwide............................ $ 6.04 $ 7.31 $ 5.45 Hedging activities. The Company, from time to time, utilizes commodity swap and collar contracts in order to (i) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities the Company produces and sells, (ii) support the Companys annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and (iii) reduce commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Companys commodity price hedges decreased oil and gas revenues from continuing operations by $149.0 million, $284.9 million and $121.9 million, respectively. The effective portions of changes in the fair values of the Companys commodity price hedges are deferred as increases or decreases to stockholders equity until the underlying hedged transaction occurs. Consequently, changes in the effective portions of commodity price hedges add volatility to the Companys reported stockholders equity until the hedge derivative matures or is terminated. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for information concerning the impact to oil and gas revenues during 2006, 2005 and 2004 from the Companys hedging activities, the Companys open and terminated hedge positions at December 31, 2006 and descriptions of the Companys commodity hedge derivatives. Also see "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for additional disclosures about the Companys commodity related derivative financial instruments. Subsequent to December 31, 2006, the Company reduced its oil hedge positions by terminating certain oil swap contracts and increased its gas hedge position by adding additional gas swap contracts. See Note J of Notes to 42 Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for information concerning these changes in the oil and gas hedge positions. Deferred revenue. During 2006 and 2005, the Companys recognition of previously deferred VPP revenue increased oil and gas revenues from continuing operations by $190.3 million and $75.8 million, respectively. The Companys amortization of deferred VPP revenue is scheduled to increase 2007 oil and gas revenues by $181.2 million. See Note T of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for specific information regarding the Companys VPPs. Interest and other income. The Companys interest and other income totaled $58.7 million, $31.5 million and $2.2 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $27.2 million increase during 2006, as compared to 2005, is primarily attributable to (i) $13.8 million of hedge ineffectiveness gains recorded during 2006, (ii) a $13.2 million increase in interest income primarily attributable to the investing the proceeds from the Argentine and deepwater Gulf of Mexico divestitures during 2006 and (iii) $5.6 million of Alaskan exploration incentive credits received in 2006, offset by a $6.6 million decrease in business interruption insurance claims primarily attributable to the 2005 Fain plant fire in the West Panhandle field. The increase in interest and other income during 2005, as compared to 2004, is primarily attributable to the recognition of $14.2 million in business interruption insurance claims related to the Fain plant fire. See Note M of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding interest and other income. Gain (loss) on disposition of assets. The Company recorded a net loss on disposition of assets of $7.9 million in 2006, as compared to net gains of $59.8 million and $39,000 during 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2005, the gain was primarily related to (i) the sale of the stock of a subsidiary that owned the interest in the Olowi block in Gabon, which resulted in a $47.5 million gain and (ii) a $14 million insurance settlement on the Companys East Cameron facility that was destroyed by Hurricane Rita, which resulted in a $9.7 million gain. During 2006, the Company recognized gains on the sale of its interest in certain oil and gas properties in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and its Argentina assets of approximately $737.2 million. During 2005, the Company also recognized gains on the sale of certain assets in Canada and the shelf of the Gulf of Mexico of approximately $166.2 million. However, pursuant to SFAS 144, these gains and the results of operations from the assets are presented as discontinued operations. The net cash proceeds from asset divestitures during 2006, 2005 and 2004 were used, together with net cash flows provided by operating activities, to fund additions to oil and gas properties and stock repurchase programs, and to reduce outstanding indebtedness. See Notes N and V of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding asset divestitures. Oil and gas production costs. The Companys oil and gas production costs totaled $398.3 million, $346.4 million and $224.9 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In general, lease operating expenses and workover expenses represent the components of oil and gas production costs over which the Company has management control, while production taxes and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes. Total production costs per BOE increased during 2006 by 18 percent as compared to 2005 primarily due to (i) the impact of a 126 percent increase in delivered volumes under VPP agreements, for which the Company bears all associated production costs and records no associated sales volumes (representing a per BOE production cost impact of approximately $1.50 during 2006 as compared to $.59 during 2005), (ii) general inflation of field service and supply costs and (iii) increases in production and ad valorem taxes and field utility costs due to increasing commodity and utility prices. Total production costs per BOE increased during 2005 by 41 percent as compared to 2004. The increase in total production costs per BOE during 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily attributable to (i) an increase in production and ad valorem taxes as a result of higher commodity prices, (ii) higher Canadian gas transportation fees, (iii) the retention of production costs related to VPP volumes sold (approximately $.59 per BOE, during 2005), (iv) new production added from the Evergreen merger, which are relatively higher per BOE operating cost properties and (v) increases in field service and supply costs primarily associated with rising commodity prices. 43 The following tables provide the components of the Companys total production costs per BOE and total production costs per BOE by geographic area for 2006, 2005 and 2004: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Lease operating expenses.................... $ 6.23 $ 5.06 $ 3.87 Third party transportation charges.......... 1.22 1.03 .44 Taxes: Ad valorem................................. 1.24 1.09 .82 Production................................. 1.69 1.61 1.10 Workover costs.............................. .71 .57 .39 Total production costs..................... $11.09 $ 9.36 $ 6.62 Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 United States............................... $10.62 $ 8.99 $ 6.24 Canada...................................... $16.82 $14.83 $10.79 South Africa................................ $14.47 $11.79 $ 8.31 Tunisia..................................... $ 3.41 $ 3.20 $ 3.58 Worldwide................................... $11.09 $ 9.36 $ 6.62 Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense. The Companys total DD&A expense was $10.01, $8.11 and $6.81 per BOE for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Depletion expense, the largest component of DD&A expense, was $9.34, $7.56 and $6.46 per BOE during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During 2006, the increase in per BOE depletion expense was primarily due to (i) a generally increasing trend in the Companys oil and gas properties cost bases per BOE of proved and proved developed reserves as a result of cost inflation in drilling rig rates and drilling supplies, (ii) the aforementioned sale of proved reserves under VPP agreements, for which the Company removed proved reserves with no corresponding decrease in cost basis, (iii) a $.50 per BOE increase in Tunisian depletion, primarily associated with 2006 and 2005 decreases in the Companys interest in the Adam Concession, offset by (iv) a $3.91 per BOE decrease in South Africa depletion, primarily associated with 2006 and 2005 positive revisions to proved reserves based on well performance. During 2005, the increase in per BOE depletion expense was due to relatively higher per BOE cost basis Rocky Mountains area production acquired in the Evergreen merger and a higher depletion rate for the Hugoton and Spraberry fields as a result of the VPP volumes sold. The following table provides depletion expense per BOE from continuing operations by geographic area for 2006, 2005 and 2004: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 United States............................... $ 9.07 $ 7.10 $ 5.34 Canada...................................... $15.39 $12.71 $12.93 South Africa................................ $ 6.28 $10.19 $12.86 Tunisia..................................... $ 4.25 $ 3.75 $ 4.43 Worldwide................................... $ 9.34 $ 7.56 $ 6.46 Impairment of oil and gas properties. The Company reviews its long lived assets to be held and used, including oil and gas properties, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. During 2005 and 2004, the Company recognized noncash impairment charges of $644 thousand and $39.7 million, respectively, to reduce the carrying value of its Gabonese Olowi field assets as development of the discovery was canceled. See "Critical Accounting Estimates" below and Notes B and S of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information pertaining to the Companys accounting policies regarding assessments of impairment and the Gabonese Olowi field impairment, respectively. 44 Exploration, abandonments, geological and geophysical costs. The following table provides the Companys geological and geophysical costs, exploratory dry hole expense, lease abandonments and other exploration expense by geographic area for 2006, 2005 and 2004: United South States Canada Africa Tunisia Other Total Year ended December 31, 2006: Geological and geophysical....... $ 79,141 $ 5,287 $ 288 $ 8,402 $ 21,536 $ 114,654 Exploratory dry holes............ 80,024 6,438 7,227 6,214 15,845 115,748 Leasehold abandonments and other. 13,696 2,223 17,824 33,743 $ 172,861 $ 13,948 $ 7,515 $ 14,616 $ 55,205 $ 264,145 Year ended December 31, 2005: Geological and geophysical....... $ 63,707 $ 4,452 $ 283 $ $ 34,070 $ 102,512 Exploratory dry holes............ 24,462 3,468 804 9,041 9,136 46,911 Leasehold abandonments and other. 8,957 1,625 125 3,193 13,900 $ 97,126 $ 9,545 $ 1,212 $ 9,041 $ 46,399 $ 163,323 Year ended December 31, 2004: Geological and geophysical....... $ 49,722 $ 4,047 $ 868 $ $ 13,965 $ 68,602 Exploratory dry holes............ 1,151 11,131 (338) 24,798 36,742 Leasehold abandonments and other. 4,138 3,883 6 8,027 $ 55,011 $ 19,061 $ 530 $ $ 38,769 $ 113,371 During 2006, significant components of the Companys dry hole provisions and leasehold abandonments expense included (i) $34.0 million of costs associated with the Companys unsuccessful exploratory well on its Block 256 prospect offshore Nigeria, including $17.8 million of associated unproved leasehold impairment, (ii) $21.6 million of dry hole provisions recorded for the Companys unsuccessful Cronus, Storms and Antigua prospects in the North Slope area of Alaska, (iii) $18.4 million of dry hole provisions and abandonment costs recognized on prospects drilled in prior periods that were being evaluated for commerciality, including $7.2 million of costs associated with the Companys Boomslang prospect offshore South Africa, $7.0 million of costs associated with two discoveries on the Gulf of Mexico shelf in 2005 and $4.2 million of costs associated with the Companys Anaguid permit in Tunisia, (iv) $16.0 million of dry hole provision and unproved property impairment recognized on the Companys unsuccessful Norphlet prospect in Mississippi, (v) a $14.3 million unsuccessful well on the Companys Flying Cloud prospect in the Gulf of Mexico and (vi) $6.4 million of unsuccessful exploratory wells in Canada. During 2006, the Company completed and evaluated 414 exploration/extension wells, 384 of which were successfully completed as discoveries. Significant components of the Companys dry hole expense during 2005 included (i) $21.2 million related to Alaskan well costs, (ii) $9.5 million associated with an unsuccessful Nigerian well, (iii) $3.5 million attributable to an unsuccessful suspended well in the Companys El Hamra permit in Tunisia, (iv) $5.1 million attributable to an unsuccessful suspended well in the Companys Anaguid permit in Tunisia and (v) various other exploratory wells. During 2005, the Company completed and evaluated 180 exploratory/extension wells, 149 of which were successfully completed as discoveries. Significant components of the Companys dry hole expense during 2004 included (i) $19.0 million on the Companys Gabonese Olowi prospect and (ii) $5.8 million associated with the Companys Bravo prospect offshore Equatorial Guinea. During 2004, the Company completed and evaluated 103 exploratory/extension wells, 58 of which were successfully completed as discoveries. General and administrative expense. General and administrative expense totaled $121.8 million, $114.2 million and $73.2 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expense during 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to a full year effect of the 2005 staff increases associated with the Evergreen acquisition. The Company continues to review its general and administrative expenses and remains focused on initiatives to control its expenditures. 45 The increase in general and administrative expense during 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to increases in administrative staff, including staff increases associated with the Evergreen merger, and performance related compensation costs, including the amortization of restricted stock awarded to officers, directors and employees during 2005. Interest expense. Interest expense was $107.0 million, $126.1 million and $102.0 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on the Companys indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 6.7 percent, as compared to 6.5 percent and 5.4 percent for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, including the effects of interest rate derivatives. The decrease in interest expense for 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily due to the repayment of portions of the Companys outstanding borrowings under the Companys credit facility with proceeds from the divestiture of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine assets and an $11.1 million increase in interest capitalized on the Companys Oooguruk development project in Alaska and the South Coast Gas project in South Africa, partially offset by a $4.1 million decrease in the amortization of interest rate hedge gains. The increase in interest expense for 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily due to increased average borrowings under the Companys lines of credit, primarily as a result of the cash portion of the consideration paid in the Evergreen merger and $949.3 million of stock repurchases completed during 2005, a $15.2 million decrease in the amortization of interest rate hedge gains, the assumption of $300 million of notes in connection with the Evergreen merger and higher interest rates in 2005. See Note F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information about the Companys long term debt and interest expense. Hurricane activity, net. The Company recorded net hurricane related activity expenses of $32.0 million and $39.8 million during 2006 and 2005, respectively, associated with the Companys East Cameron platform facility, located on the Gulf of Mexico shelf, that was destroyed during 2005 by Hurricane Rita. The Company does not plan to rebuild the facility based on the economics of the field. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Companys application to "reef in place" a substantial portion of the East Cameron debris was denied. As a result, the Company currently estimates that it will cost approximately $119 million to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron facility. The estimate to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron facility is based upon an analysis and fee proposal prepared by a third party engineering firm for the majority of the work and an estimate by the Company for the remainder. During 2006 and 2005, the Company recorded additional abandonment obligation charges of $75 million and $39.8 million, respectively. The operations to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron facilities began in January 2007 and the Company expects to incur a substantial portion of the costs in 2007. The Company expects that a substantial portion of the total estimated cost to reclaim and abandon the facility will be covered by insurance, including 100 percent of the debris removal costs. Consequently, the Company has recorded a $43.0 million insurance recovery receivable corresponding to the estimated debris removal costs. Other expenses. Other expenses were $36.3 million during 2006, as compared to $99.4 million during 2005 and $28.4 million during 2004. The $63.1 million decrease in other expenses during 2006, as compared to 2005, is primarily attributable to (i) a $53.2 million decrease in hedge ineffectiveness charges and other derivative losses and (ii) a $17.9 million decrease in loss on early extinguishment of portions of the Companys senior notes. The increase in other expenses during 2005, as compared to 2004, is primarily attributable to (i) a $43.9 million increase in hedge ineffectiveness and other derivative losses and (ii) a $26.0 million loss on the redemption and tender of portions of the Companys senior notes. See Note O of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a detailed description of the components included in other expenses. 46 Income tax provision. The Company recognized income tax provisions on continuing operations of $136.7 million, $155.8 million and $63.1 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Companys effective tax rates for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were 44.2 percent, 44.5 percent and 31.9 percent, respectively, as compared to the combined United States federal and state statutory rates of approximately 36.5 percent. The effective tax rates of 2006 and 2005 differ from the combined United States federal and state statutory rates primarily due to: o foreign tax rates, o adjustments to the deferred tax liability for changes in enacted tax laws and rates, as discussed below, o statutes in foreign jurisdictions that differ from those in the United States, o recognition of $8.4 million of deferred tax benefit during 2006 as a result of the conversion of senior convertible notes prior to the Companys repayment of the debt principal, o recognition of $7.2 million of taxes during 2005 associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and o expenses for unsuccessful well costs and associated acreage costs in foreign locations where the Company does not expect to receive income tax benefits. During May 2006, the State of Texas enacted legislation that changed the existing Texas franchise tax from a tax based on net income or taxable capital to an income tax based on a defined calculation of gross margin (the "Texas margin tax"). Also, during 2006, the Canadian federal and provincial governments enacted tax rate reductions that will be phased in over several years. SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" requires that deferred tax balances be adjusted to reflect tax rate changes during the periods in which the tax rate changes are enacted. The adjustment due to the enactment of the Texas margin tax and the Canadian tax rate changes resulted in a $13.5 million United States tax expense and a $10.2 million Canadian tax benefit during the year ended December 31, 2006, respectively. See "Critical Accounting Estimates" below and Note P of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys tax position. Discontinued operations.
