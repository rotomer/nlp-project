Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operations" for additional discussions regarding proved reserves and their related cash flows. Proved Reserves The Companys proved reserves totaled 963.8 MMBOE, 904.9 MMBOE and 986.7 MMBOE at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, representing $9.0 billion, $4.7 billion and $7.3 billion, respectively, of Standardized Measure. The Companys proved reserves include field fuel, which is gas consumed to operate field equipment (primarily compressors) prior to the gas being delivered to a sales point. The following table shows the changes in the Companys proved reserve volumes by geographic area during the year ended December 31, 2007 (in MBOE): Production Extensions and Discoveries Purchases of Minerals in Place Sales of Minerals in Place Revisions of Previous Estimates United States (35,715 ) 44,571 50,424 (227 ) 21,495 Canada (2,950 ) 10,755 &mdash; (35,712 ) (3,210 ) South Africa (1,151 ) &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; (4,485 ) Tunisia (1,557 ) 24,478 &mdash; (11,771 ) 3,880 Total (41,373 ) 79,804 50,424 (47,710 ) 17,680 Production. Production volumes include 2,891 MBOE of field fuel and 2,950 MBOE of production associated with divested assets being presented as discontinued operations. Extensions and discoveries. Extensions and discoveries are primarily the result of extension drilling in the Raton field and Spraberry field in the United States and the Horseshoe Canyon field in Canada and lower risk exploratory drilling in the Companys South Texas Edwards Trend and Tunisian resource plays. Purchases of minerals in place. Purchases of minerals in place are primarily attributable to bolt on acquisitions in the Companys Spraberry oil field, Raton gas field and the entry into the Barnett Shale gas field. Sales of minerals in place. Sales of minerals in place are principally related to the Companys divestiture of its Canadian assets and the Tunisian governments election to participate in 50 percent of the Companys discoveries in the Cherouq concession in the Jenein Nord permit. See Note N of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Revisions of previous estimates. Revisions of previous estimates are comprised of 20 MMBOE of positive price revisions offset by 2 MMBOE of negative technical revisions. The Companys proved reserves at December 31, 2007 were determined using year end NYMEX equivalent prices of $95.92 per barrel of oil and $6.80 per Mcf of gas, compared to $60.82 per barrel of oil and $5.64 per Mcf of gas at December 31, 2006. 20 On a BOE basis, 62 percent of the Companys total proved reserves at December 31, 2007 were proved developed reserves. Based on reserve information as of December 31, 2007, and using the Companys production information for the year then ended, excluding production associated with divested assets included in discontinued operations, the reserve to production ratio associated with the Companys proved reserves was in excess of 20 years on a BOE basis.

Description of Properties United States Approximately 89 percent of the Companys proved reserves at December 31, 2007 are located in the Spraberry field in the Permian Basin area, the Hugoton and West Panhandle fields in the Mid Continent area and the Raton field in the Rocky Mountains area. These fields generate substantial operating cash flow and the Spraberry and Raton fields have a large portfolio of low risk drilling opportunities. The cash flows generated from these fields provide funding for the Companys other development and exploration activities both domestically and internationally. 21 The following tables summarize the Companys United States development and exploration/extension drilling activities during 2007: Development Drilling Beginning Wells In Progress Wells Spud Successful Wells Unsuccessful Wells Ending Wells In Progress Permian Basin 10 350 350 &mdash; 10 Mid Continent 1 &mdash; 1 &mdash; &mdash; Rocky Mountains 5 230 233 2 &mdash; Onshore Gulf Coast 2 16 18 &mdash; &mdash; Total United States 18 596 602 2 10 Exploration/Extension Drilling Beginning Wells In Progress Wells Spud Successful Wells Unsuccessful Wells Ending Wells In Progress Permian Basin 1 1 1 &mdash; 1 Rocky Mountains 16 19 15 2 18 Onshore Gulf Coast 4 19 19 1 3 Barnett Shale &mdash; 6 6 &mdash; &mdash; Alaska &mdash; 3 &mdash; 2 1 Total United States 21 48 41 5 23 The following table summarizes the Companys United States costs incurred by geographic area during 2007: Property Acquisition Costs Exploration Costs Development Costs Asset Retirement Obligations Proved Unproved Total (in thousands) Permian Basin $ 56,232 $ 61,546 $ 23,395 $ 422,158 $ 2,987 $ 566,318 Mid Continent 314 &mdash; 47 21,436 (951 ) 20,846 Rocky Mountains 164,730 43,502 71,467 180,340 29,813 489,852 Onshore Gulf Coast 6,367 6,364 148,756 140,130 1,507 303,124 Barnett Shale 99,133 87,788 23,351 &mdash; 1,320 211,592 Alaska &mdash; 1,554 68,993 260,848 (a) (218 ) 331,177 Gulf of Mexico Continuing operations &mdash; 13 (1,269 ) 4,893 (1,315 ) 2,322 Discontinued operations &mdash; &mdash; 745 354 &mdash; 1,099 Total United States $ 326,776 $ 200,767 $ 335,485 $ 1,030,159 $ 33,143 $ 1,926,330 (a) Includes $22.0 million of capitalized interest related to the Oooguruk project. Permian Basin Spraberry field. The Spraberry field was discovered in 1949 and encompasses eight counties in West Texas. The field is approximately 150 miles long and 75 miles wide at its widest point. The oil produced is West Texas Intermediate Sweet, and the gas produced is casinghead gas with an average energy content of 1,400 Btu. The oil and gas are produced primarily from three formations, the upper and lower Spraberry and the Dean, at depths ranging from 6,700 feet to 9,200 feet. In addition, the Company has started completing the majority of its wells in the Wolfcamp formation at depths ranging from 9,300 feet to 10,300 feet with successful results. The Company believes the Spraberry field offers excellent opportunities to enhance oil and gas production because of the numerous undeveloped drilling locations, many of which are reflected in the Companys proved undeveloped reserves, and the ability to contain operating expenses and drilling costs through economies of scale. 22 During July 2007, the Company entered into an agreement under which the Company has the option to purchase an additional 22 percent interest in the Spraberry Midkiff Benedum gas processing system for $230 million, subject to normal closing adjustments. The additional 22 percent can be purchased in 2008 and 2009 and, if exercised, will increase the Companys interest in the system to 49 percent. In conjunction with this transaction, the Company extended its percent of proceeds ("POP") contract with the plant to 2022 and negotiated incremental increases in the Companys POP beginning in 2009. In December 2007, the Company acquired approximately 44,000 gross acres in the Spraberry field for $89.4 million, with Pioneer being operator of the acquired properties. Proved reserves associated with the acquisition are approximately 15 MMBOE. The Company estimates that the acquisition provides more than 600 potential drilling locations utilizing 40 acre spacing. During 2007, the Company (a) drilled 350 wells, an increase of over 17 percent compared to 2006, (b) acquired approximately 185,000 gross acres, bringing its total acreage position to approximately 869,000 gross acres (688,000 net acres), (c) completed several bolt on property acquisitions and joint ventures and (d) successfully drilled a majority of the wells to the Wolfcamp formation. The Company plans to drill approximately 350 wells in 2008 and continue to pursue acreage expansions and bolt on acquisitions. Mid Continent Hugoton field. The Hugoton field in southwest Kansas is one of the largest producing gas fields in the continental United States. The gas is produced from the Chase and Council Grove formations at depths ranging from 2,700 feet to 3,000 feet. The Companys gas in the Hugoton field has an average energy content of 1,025 Btu. The Companys Hugoton properties are located on approximately 285,000 gross acres (247,000 net acres), covering approximately 400 square miles. The Company has working interests in approximately 1,200 wells in the Hugoton field, approximately 990 of which it operates, and partial royalty interests in approximately 500 wells. The Company owns substantially all of the gathering and processing facilities, primarily the Satanta plant, which service its production from the Hugoton field. Such ownership allows the Company to control the production, gathering, processing and sale of its gas and NGL production. The Companys Hugoton operated wells are capable of producing approximately 65 MMcf of wet gas per day (i.e., gas production at the wellhead before processing or field fuel use and before reduction for royalties). Pioneer successfully led a cooperative effort with other operators in this field to effect rule changes which will enable further field development in future years. As part of the rule changes, the state regulated production allowables were canceled as of December 31, 2007, and the Company received regulatory approval to commingle production from the Panoma and Council Grove formations. A commingling pilot program has been initiated and the Company is monitoring its production performance. To capitalize on these rule changes, future completion designs are being developed and continued optimization is planned for the existing field compression system. West Panhandle field. The West Panhandle properties are located in the panhandle region of Texas. These stable, long lived reserves are attributable to the Red Cave, Brown Dolomite, Granite Wash and fractured Granite formations at depths no greater than 3,500 feet. The Companys gas in the West Panhandle field has an average energy content of 1,365 Btuand is produced from approximately 675 wells on more than 250,000 gross acres (240,000 net acres) covering over 375 square miles. The Company controls 100 percent of the wells, production equipment, gathering system and the Fain gas processing plant for the field. As this field is operated at or below vacuum conditions, Pioneer continually works to improve compressor / gathering system efficiency. As part of this effort, approximately 17 miles of 16 inch pipeline was recently replaced in the heart of the field. The Company received regulatory relief in parts of the West Panhandle field to allow for future infill drilling locations. 23 Rocky Mountains Raton field. The Raton Basin properties are located in the southeast portion of Colorado. Exploration for CBM in the Raton Basin began in the late 1970s and continued through the late 1980s, with several companies drilling and testing more than 100 wells during this period. The absence of a pipeline to transport gas from the Raton Basin prevented full scale development until January 1995, when Colorado Interstate Gas Company completed the construction of the Picketwire lateral pipeline system. The Companys gas in the Raton Basin has an average energy content of 1,000 Btu. Since the completion of the Picketwire lateral, production has continued to grow, resulting in expansion of the systems capacity by its operator, the most recent expansion of which was in 2005. The Company owns approximately 318,000 gross acres (231,000 net acres) in the center of the Raton Basin with current production from coal seams in the Vermejo and Raton formations. The Company owns the majority of the well servicing and frac equipment that it utilizes in the Raton field to control costs and insure availability. In the Raton field, the Company sells its gas at a Mid Continent index price which historically has generally provided higher realized gas prices as compared to the Rockies based indexes. In December 2007, the Company acquired approximately 30,000 net acres in the Raton Basin for $205.3 million. The acquired acreage has approximately 95 Bcf of proved reserves. During 2007, the Company (a) drilled 230 wells, and put 301 wells on production, (b) added wellhead compression and (c) continued efforts to optimize gathering and compression facilities. During 2008, the Company expects to complete approximately 175 wells. Piceance/Uinta Basins. The Piceance Basin is located in the central portion of western Colorado, and the Uinta Basin is located in the central portion of eastern Utah. The Company owns approximately 244,000 gross acres covering producing and prospective regions of the Piceance and Uinta Basins. Currently, production is established from various tight sandstone, coal and shale formations. The Companys significant projects in the area are CBM plays at Columbine Springs and Castlegate and a deep gas play at Main Canyon. Sand Wash Basin. The Sand Wash Basin is the site of a potential CBM project located north of the Companys Piceance Basin properties. The Company holds a 50 percent operated interest in 114,000 gross acres in the Lay Creek field. At Lay Creek, the Company has drilled 18 wells in six separate pilot areas and completed workovers and recompletions on 14 wells drilled by a previous operator. The Company completed the water treatment facilities and initiated sales of production in 2007. Determination of success of the pilot project is dependent on the ability to dewater the formation and determine if commercial quantities of gas can be produced. The pilot project is currently in the dewatering phase and a determination of commerciality should be known by the end of 2008. Gas prices. In general, industry drilling success in the Rocky Mountains area (which affects the Companys properties in the Piceance/Uinta Basins and Sand Wash Basin) has created more supply than can be transported by the currently available pipeline infrastructure. As a result, gas prices in the region have experienced greater volatility and at the end of the third quarter of 2007 spot gas prices for the area were approximately $.60 per MMBtu. As a result of the extremely low gas prices during September and October of 2007, the Company shut in approximately 5 to 6 MMcfpd of gas production in the Uinta/Piceance area. Additional pipeline capacity was added in the first quarter of 2008 with the start up of the Rockies Express pipeline, which should alleviate the capacity constraints, allowing more gas to reach consumer markets at improved price levels. Prices have rebounded in the area since September 30, 2007 and the Company believes that gas prices will continue to improve as a result of the Rockies Express pipeline being in service. Onshore Gulf Coast South Texas. In 2007, the South Texas drilling program focused on the Edwards Trend, a tight gas limestone reservoir characterized by narrow bands of dry gas fields extending over 250 miles in length. The Companys drilling activity occurred in both established areas such as Pawnee field and growth areas along the Trend. To date the Company has acquired over 305,000 gross acres in the Edwards Trend. In addition to the Pawnee field, the Company has operations in the SW Kenedy, Sawfish, Word, Three Rivers and Washburn fields. Production depths in the Edwards Trend range from 9,500 feet to 14,500 feet. During 2007, the Company drilled 20 exploration and appraisal wells targeting new field discoveries in the Edwards Trend growth areas with 100 percent success, exceeding expectations and increasing proved gas reserves. Nine of these new wells have been added to production, three wells are awaiting pipelines or testing, four are 24 awaiting stimulation, and four are waiting on the horizontal lateral portion of the well to be completed. In previously established areas, including the Pawnee field, 14 wells were drilled with 100 percent success. The acquisition of 3 D seismic data has significantly enhanced field development in all areas of the Edwards Trend, allowing the Company to more accurately locate and orient the horizontal wells for optimal results. To expand its 3 D data coverage to include new discoveries and additional prospects, the Company is in the process of shooting and interpreting approximately 900 square miles of new data. Multiple surveys were completed in 2007 and more are planned for 2008. In order to accommodate its rapidly growing Edwards Trend production, the Company significantly expanded its existing gas gathering and processing infrastructure during 2007. The expansion included over 30 miles of gathering system and three additional treating facilities were installed. In 2008, the Company expects a comparable drilling program to that in 2007. Also planned are additional facilities expansions to accommodate increasing production. Mississippi. The Company has built an acreage position covering multiple plays in the Mississippi Salt Basin and now holds leases and option interests covering approximately 150,000 net acres. Over the next two to three years, the Company expects to test a number of opportunities and to continue technical work that is currently underway. The Company drilled two successful Cotton Valley wells in the Bolton field and installed a gas treating facility to process the gas. The Company is permitting for a 3 D seismic shoot in 2008 for the Bolton field to better define the resource potential and future drilling plans. Barnett Shale During 2007, the Company participated in the drilling of six successful exploration wells on its approximate 9,300 gross acres in the Barnett Shale play that it acquired in the second quarter of 2007. In December 2007, the Company expanded its Barnett Shale acreage position by completing a $144.3 million acquisition. The Company estimates proved reserves on the acreage to be approximately 13.5 MMBOE. The acreage being acquired contains more than 300 potential drilling locations, with most locations covered by 3 D seismic data. The Companys total holdings in the Barnett Shale play now approximate 80,000 gross acres, with more than 450 potential drilling locations. The Company plans to drill 20 wells in 2008 with the expectation of increasing its drilling program in 2009. Alaska Oooguruk. In 2002, the Company acquired a 70 percent working interest and operatorship in ten state leases on Alaskas North Slope, and in 2003 drilled three exploratory wells to test a possible extension of the productive sands in the Kuparuk River field in the shallow waters offshore the North Slope of Alaska. Although all three of the wells found the sands filled with oil, they were too thin to be considered commercial on a stand alone basis. However, the wells also encountered thick sections of oil bearing Jurassic aged sands, and the first well flowed at a rate of approximately 1,300 Bbls per day. In January 2004, the Company farmed into a large acreage block to the southwest of the Companys discovery. In 2004, Pioneer completed an extensive technical and economic evaluation of the resource potential within this area. As a result of this evaluation, the Company performed front end engineering and permitting activities during 2005 to further define the scope of the project. In early 2006, the Company announced that it had approved the development of the Oooguruk field in the project area. The Company constructed and armored the gravel drilling and production island site in 2006. Installation of a subsea flowline and production facilities to carry produced liquids to existing onshore processing facilities at the Kuparuk River Unit was completed in 2007. Pioneer assembled the drilling rig on location and commenced drilling the first of approximately 40 horizontal development and injector wells in December of 2007. The Company estimates that first production will occur during the first half of 2008 and that first sales will occur mid year 2008. During 2008, the Company expects to drill 13 to 15 of the 40 planned wells. Cosmopolitan. In 2005, the Company acquired an interest in the Cosmopolitan Unit in the Cook Inlet of Alaska. Through a series of transactions, the Company now owns 100 percent of the Cosmopolitan Unit. The 25 previous operator of the Cosmopolitan Unit had an oil discovery for which economic viability was not determined. During 2005 and 2006, the Company completed and interpreted a 3 D seismic shoot. During 2007, the Company drilled a lateral sidetrack from an existing wellbore at an onshore site to further appraise the resource potential of the unit. The initial unstimulated production test results were encouraging. The Company plans to begin permitting activities and continue facilities planning during 2008 for a future potential development of the project and to drill another appraisal well in 2009. Onshore North Slope area. During the 2006 2007 winter drilling season, the Company participated in drilling two exploratory wells in the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska ("NPRA") area, both of which were noncommercial. Gulf of Mexico Gulf of Mexico area. During 2005, the Company announced a discovery on its Clipper prospect in the Green Canyon Blocks 299 and 300 in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. During 2006, the Company drilled two successful Clipper appraisal wells, but drilled an unsuccessful exploratory well at the Flying Cloud prospect, a prospect near the Clipper discovery. The Company began evaluation plans for the potential development of the discovery, but projected capital costs for the project doubled during the evaluation, which resulted in the Company electing to not pursue the development of the Clipper project. Accordingly, the Company recognized an exploration and abandonment charge of $72.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. As a result of Hurricane Rita, the Companys East Cameron facility, located on the Gulf of Mexico shelf, was destroyed. Operations to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron facility began in 2007. During the second quarter of 2007, the Company increased the estimated cost to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron facility by $66.0 million to an aggregate estimated cost of $185 million. The estimate to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron facility is based upon an analysis prepared by a third party engineering firm for the majority of the work, an estimate by the Company for the remaining work that was not covered by the third party analysis and actual abandonment activity to date. See Note U of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information on the East Cameron 322 facility. International The Companys international operations are located offshore South Africa and onshore in southern Tunisia. Additionally, the Company has an exploration permit in Equatorial Guinea. During 2007, the Company also disposed of its interests in Block 320 in Nigeria, and relinquished its remaining interest in Block 256 in Nigeria due to unsuccessful exploratory drilling results. The Company is currently winding up its efforts to exit Nigeria completely. In November 2007, the Company closed the sale of all of the Companys common stock in its Canadian subsidiaries for net proceeds of $525.7 million, resulting in a gain of $101.3 million. See Notes N, S and V of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a description of the Nigerian and Canadian divestitures. As of December 31, 2007, approximately three percent of the Companys proved reserves were located in Africa.

South Africa. The Company has agreements to explore for oil and gas covering over 3.6 million acres offshore the southern coast of South Africa in water depths generally less than 650 feet. The Sable oil field began producing in August 2003 and the majority of the gas from the field has been reinjected. The Company has a 40 percent working interest in the Sable field. In 2005, the Company sanctioned the non operated South Coast Gas development project, which includes the subsea tie back of gas from the Sable field and five additional gas accumulations to an existing production facility on the F A platform for transportation via existing pipelines to a gas to liquids plant. Pioneer has a 45 percent working interest in the project. As part of sanctioning of the South Coast Gas project, the Company signed a six year contract for the sale of all of its gas and condensate production from the project. The contract contains an obligation for the purchaser to take or pay for a total of 91.4 BCF and associated condensate if the anticipated deliverability estimates are achieved. The price for both gas and condensate is indexed to Brent oil prices. During 2007, two additional wells were drilled and installation of pipeline and facilities infrastructure was completed as part of the South Coast Gas project. First production from the South Coast Gas project was achieved in the third quarter of 2007 at approximately 15 to 20 MMcfpd (gross). It is expected that the simultaneous production of both oil and gas from the Sable field will increase the ultimately recoverable oil reserves. A significant portion of the gas reserves associated with the South Coast Gas project is in the Sable field. Initially, the gas production from the Sable field was not expected to commence until the oil production was completed. However, as a result of production performance from the Sable field and improved oil prices, which have had the effect of extending the economic life of the Sable oil field, facilities modifications are being planned that would allow for the simultaneous production of oil and gas from the Sable field. The modifications are currently expected to be completed in late 2008 or early 2009. 27 Tunisia. The Company holds interests in four separate onshore permits located in the southern portion of Tunisia. These permits cover a gross area of approximately 11,900 square kilometers containing two production concessions targeting the Acacus formation with additional future upside exploration potential from this and other formations. &bull; Jenein Nord Permit and Cherouq Concession. The Jenein Nord Permit covers approximately 1,200 square kilometers. Over the past two years, the Company has conducted an intensive exploration program over the area. As a result of an aggressive seismic data acquisition and exploration drilling program, the Company achieved a significant number of hydrocarbon discoveries. Based on the success, the Company, along with the government oil agency, Enterprise Tunisienne dActivities Petrolieres ("ETAP"), submitted a joint application on November 10, 2007 to the Directeur G&eacute;n&eacute;ral de lEnergie for the development of a portion of the permit area called the Cherouq Concession. On December 17, 2007, the Consultative Committee of Hydrocarbons, the advisory committee to the Directeur G&eacute;n&eacute;ral de lEnergie, approved the Cherouq Concession resulting in the Company and ETAP each holding a 50 percent working interest in the concession. The concession covers approximately 760 square kilometers of the Jenein Nord Permit. During 2007, the Company drilled seven exploration wells and first production from the concession was achieved in late fourth quarter 2007. The Company plans to drill up to seven additional wells and acquire an additional 295 square kilometers of 3 D seismic data over the Cherouq Concession during 2008. &bull; Borj El Khadra Permit and Adam Concession. The Borj El Khadra Permit, including the Adam Concession, covers approximately 2,900 square kilometers. Production from the Adam Concession began in May 2003, for which the Company now has a 20 percent working interest. During 2007, the Company continued its exploratory and appraisal activities on the Adam Concession by drilling four wells, of which all were successful, and completed drilling of two wells in the Borj El Khadra Permit, of which one was successful. The Company plans to drill an additional four wells in the Adam Concession and two wells in the Borj El Khadra exploration permit during 2008. &bull; El Hamra Permit. The El Hamra exploration permit covers approximately 4,000 square kilometers, of which the Company is operator with a 50 percent working interest during the exploration period. In 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of 310 kilometers of seismic data and began processing the data. Processing and interpretation of the seismic data is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of 2008. The Company anticipates drilling an exploration well in the second half of 2008. &bull; Anaguid Permit. The Anaguid exploration permit covers approximately 3,800 square kilometers. In 2007, the Company acquired an additional 15 percent interest in the Anaguid exploration permit, thereby increasing its interest to 60 percent (during the exploration period) and resulting in the transfer of operations to Pioneer. The Company intends to acquire an additional 900 square kilometers of 3 D seismic data and expects to drill up to two exploration wells in the second half of 2008. Equatorial Guinea. The Company owns a 50 percent interest in Block H in deepwater Equatorial Guinea, which covers over 240,000 acres. In late 2006, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea ratified a new hydrocarbons law, which among other things, appears to entitle Equatorial Guinea to increase substantially its carried interest in all concessions, including Block H. In addition, drilling costs have increased significantly beyond those originally anticipated. Given these and other facts, the Company and the other participants in the block have been unable to reach an agreement as to their respective rights and obligations under a joint operating agreement relating to the well operations in the block and as a result, the parties have commenced arbitration. In connection with the ongoing arbitration among the parties, the Company recognized an impairment charge of approximately $10.3 million to write off its remaining basis in Block H. See Note I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for specific information regarding the Companys arbitration associated with Block H. 28 Selected Oil and Gas Information The following tables set forth selected oil and gas information from continuing operations for the Company as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Because of normal production declines, increased or decreased drilling activities and the effects of acquisitions or divestitures, the historical information presented below should not be interpreted as being indicative of future results. Production, price and cost data. The following tables set forth production, price and cost data with respect to the Companys properties for 2007, 2006 and 2005. These amounts represent the Companys historical results from continuing operations without making pro forma adjustments for any acquisitions, divestitures or drilling activity that occurred during the respective years. The production amounts will not agree to the reserve volume tables in the "Unaudited Supplementary Information" section included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" due to field fuel volumes and production from discontinued operations being included in the reserve volume tables.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial and Operating Performance Pioneers financial and operating performance for 2007 included the following highlights: &bull; As a result of the gain recognized on the sale of deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine assets during 2006, partially offset by the gain recognized on the Canadian divestiture in 2007, net income decreased 50 percent to $372.7 million ($3.06 per diluted share) in 2007 from $739.7 million ($5.81 per diluted share) in 2006. &bull; Income from continuing operations increased to $242.0 million ($1.99 per diluted share) for 2007, as compared to $150.2 million ($1.19 per diluted share) for 2006, primarily due to higher oil and gas revenues. &bull; Average daily sales volumes, on a BOE basis, increased eight percent in 2007 as compared to 2006, primarily due to successful drilling programs and a five percent decrease in the delivery of VPP volumes. &bull; Oil and gas revenues increased $281.9 million, or 19 percent in 2007, as compared to 2006, due to a combination of increased production and increases in worldwide commodity prices. &bull; The Company completed the divestiture of the Companys Canadian subsidiary for net proceeds of $525.7 million, resulting in a gain of $101.3 million. &bull; The Company recognized income from discontinued operations of $130.7 million ($1.07 per diluted share) during 2007, primarily attributable to the sale of Canadian assets, as compared to income from discontinued operations of $589.5 million ($4.62 per diluted share) during 2006, which included the sale of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine assets. &bull; Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $20.5 million, or three percent as compared to that of 2006, primarily due to increased sales volumes, increased commodity prices and $74.9 million of income realized from the disposal of Alaskan PPT credits, offset by the cash provided by operating activities associated with the 2006 deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine asset dispositions and the 2007 disposal of the Canadian assets. &bull; The Company added 147.9 MMBOE of proved reserves during 2007, resulting in total proved reserves of 963.8 MMBOE at December 31, 2007. &bull; The Company commenced production at the South Coast Gas Project in South Africa late in the third quarter of 2007. &bull; The construction and installation of facilities at the Companys Alaskan Oooguruk project was completed and drilling was initiated in December 2007 with first production on schedule for the first half of 2008, with first sales expected mid 2008. &bull; The Company acquired oil and gas properties that complemented the Companys exploration and development drilling activities with significant acquisitions in the Spraberry field, Raton field and the Barnett Shale play of approximately $439 million. 39 2008 Outlook and Activities Commodity prices. Significant factors that may impact future commodity prices include: developments in the issues currently impacting Iraq and Iran and the Middle East in general; the extent to which members of the OPEC and other oil exporting nations are able to continue to manage oil supply through export quotas; and overall North American gas supply and demand fundamentals, including the impact of weather conditions and increasing LNG deliveries to the United States. Although the Company cannot predict the occurrence of events that may affect future commodity prices or the degree to which these prices will be affected, the prices for any commodity that the Company produces will generally approximate current market prices in the geographic region of the production. From time to time, Pioneer expects that it may hedge a portion of its commodity price risk to mitigate the impact of price volatility on its oil, NGL and gas revenues. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys commodity hedge positions at December 31, 2007. Also see "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for disclosures about the Companys commodity related derivative financial instruments. Capital budget for 2008. The Company announced a 2008 capital budget of $1.0 billion, excluding acquisitions, effects of asset retirement obligations, capitalized interest and geological and geophysical administrative costs. The 2008 capital budget is significantly less than 2007 capital spending levels, excluding acquisitions, due to the completion of facilities construction for both the South Coast Gas project off the coast of South Africa and the Oooguruk project on the North Slope of Alaska, the sale of all Canadian assets and the elimination of higher risk exploration. Approximately 90 percent of the 2008 capital budget will be focused on low risk development drilling and resource play extensions in Pioneers four core onshore areas (Spraberry, Raton, Edwards Trend and Tunisia). The remaining ten percent will be focused primarily on development drilling in the Oooguruk project and Barnett Shale drilling. For 2008, the Company currently expects that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund the $1.0 billion capital budget. 2008 Annual Production. The Company believes that the results from its 2007 drilling program and 2008 capital budget will allow the Company to realize production growth per share during 2008 of 12 percent or more as compared to the Companys 2007 production per share. First Quarter 2008 Outlook. Based on current estimates, the Company expects that first quarter 2008 production will average 103,000 to 109,000 BOEPD. The range reflects the typical variability in the timing of oil cargo shipments in South Africa and Tunisia. First quarter production costs (including production and ad valorem taxes and transportation costs) are expected to average $11.75 to $12.75 per BOE based on NYMEX strip prices for oil, NGLs and gas at the time of the estimate. Depletion, depreciation and amortization ("DD&A") expense is expected to average $10.75 to $11.75 per BOE. Total exploration and abandonment expense for the quarter is expected to be $40 million to $70 million including (i) up to $40 million from activities in the Companys resource plays in the Edwards Trend in South Texas, the Rockies area and Tunisia and (ii) up to $30 million in seismic investments and personnel costs, primarily in the Edwards Trend and Tunisia resource plays. General and administrative expense is expected to be $32 million to $36 million. Interest expense is expected to be $35 million to $40 million. Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations is expected to be $2 million to $3 million. The Companys first quarter effective income tax rate is expected to range from 40 percent to 45 percent based on current capital spending plans and higher tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions. Cash income taxes are expected to range from $10 million to $15 million, principally related to Tunisian income taxes. Pioneer Southwest Energy Partners L.P. Initial Public Offering. On January 8, 2008, Pioneer Southwest Energy Partners L.P. ("Pioneer Southwest"), a subsidiary of the Company, filed an amendment to its registration statement (subject to completion) with the SEC to sell limited partner interests. If the offering is completed, Pioneer Southwest would own interests in certain oil and gas properties currently owned by the Company in the Spraberry field in the Permian Basin of West Texas. Pioneer Southwests registration statement contemplates an offering of 7,500,000 common units representing a 35.3 percent limited partner interest in Pioneer Southwest. Upon completion of this offering, the Company would own a 0.1 percent general partner interest and a 64.6 percent limited partner interest in Pioneer Southwest. The underwriters would be granted a 30 day option to purchase up to 1,125,000 additional common units. The Companys limited partner interest would be reduced to 61.4 percent if the 40 underwriters exercise their over allotment option in full. Assuming an initial public offering price of $20.00 per common unit and that the underwriters exercise their over allotment option, estimated gross proceeds from the offering would be $150 million. In February 2008, the Company announced that the initial public offering of common units of Pioneer Southwest has been postponed due to market conditions and timing of the offering remains uncertain. There can be no assurance that Pioneer Southwest will complete the offering, or if completed, that the offering will be structured as described above. This report shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities of Pioneer Southwest. Any offers, solicitations of offers to buy, or any sales of securities of Pioneer Southwest will be made only in accordance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 or an exemption therefrom. Acquisitions 2007 acquisition expenditures. During 2007, the Company spent approximately $536.7 million to acquire proved and unproved properties. The acquisitions primarily added proved reserves and increased the Companys acreage positions in the Spraberry field, Raton field and Barnett Shale play. 2006 acquisition expenditures. During 2006, the Company spent approximately $223.2 million to acquire proved and unproved properties, which was comprised of approximately $144.8 million of proved properties and $78.3 million of unproved properties. The proved properties were primarily bolt on and acreage acquisitions in the Spraberry field and Edwards Trend area. In North America, the acquisition of unproved properties is comprised of acreage acquisitions in the Spraberry field, Edwards Trend area, Rockies area, Alaska and Canada. The Company also acquired an additional interest in its Jenein Nord block in Tunisia and recognized additional obligations associated with its Nigerian prospects during 2006. 2005 acquisition expenditures. During 2005, the Company spent approximately $272.9 million to acquire proved and unproved properties, which was comprised of approximately $173.4 million of proved properties and approximately $99.5 million of unproved properties. Divestitures Canada. In November 2007, the Company sold its Canadian subsidiaries for $525.7 million, resulting in a gain of $101.3 million. The historic results of these assets and the related gain on disposition are reported as discontinued operations. Nigeria. In prior years, a subsidiary of the Company joined other companies in a production sharing contract covering the oil prospecting license for Block 320 in deepwater Nigeria, gaining exploration rights from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. During the third quarter of 2007, the Company disposed of all its shares in the subsidiary holding Block 320. As a result of the disposition of the shares in the Nigerian subsidiary, the Company no longer owns any interest in Block 320 and will not fund or participate in any future operations in connection with Block 320. Argentina and Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. During March 2006, the Company sold its interests in certain oil and gas properties in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for net proceeds of $1.2 billion, resulting in a gain of $725.3 million. During April 2006, the Company sold its Argentine assets for net proceeds of $669.6 million, resulting in a gain of $10.9 million. The historic results of these properties and the related gains on disposition are reported as discontinued operations. Volumetric production payments. During 2005, the Company sold 27.8 MMBOE of proved reserves in the Hugoton and Spraberry fields, by means of three VPPs for net proceeds of $892.6 million, including the assignment of the Companys obligations under certain derivative hedge agreements. The Companys VPPs represent limited term overriding royalty interests in oil and gas reserves that: (i) entitle the purchaser to receive production volumes over a period of time from specific lease interests; (ii) are free and clear of all associated future production costs and capital expenditures; (iii) are nonrecourse to the Company (i.e., the purchasers only recourse is to the reserves acquired); (iv) transfers title of the reserves to the purchaser and (v) allows the Company to retain the remaining reserves after the VPPs volumetric quantities have been delivered. Based on the scheduled production deliveries, the multiple VPPs are scheduled to be completed between 2009 and 2012. 41 Canada and Shelf Gulf of Mexico. During 2005, the Company sold its interests in the Martin Creek and Conroy Black areas of northeast British Columbia and the Lookout Butte area of southern Alberta for net proceeds of $197.2 million, resulting in a gain of $138.3 million. During 2005, the Company also sold all of its interests in certain oil and gas properties on the Gulf of Mexico shelf for net proceeds of $59.2 million, resulting in a gain of $27.9 million. The historic results of these properties and the related gains on disposition are reported as discontinued operations. Gabon divestiture. In 2005, the Company closed the sale of the shares in a Gabonese subsidiary that owns the interest in the Olowi block for $47.9 million of net proceeds, resulting in a gain of $47.5 million with no associated income tax effect either in Gabon or the United States. During 2007, Pioneer relinquished its rights to receive additional payments for production discovered from deeper reservoirs on the block in consideration for a release of certain obligations. Results of Operations Oil and gas revenues. Oil and gas revenues totaled $1.7 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The revenue increase during 2007, as compared to 2006, was primarily reflective of increases in United States and Tunisian revenues, partially offset by decreases in South African revenues. The increase in United States revenues was primarily due to an increase in average daily sales volumes resulting from successful drilling programs and reductions in scheduled volumetric production payment ("VPP") deliveries, combined with an 18 percent increase in reported NGL prices and an 18 percent increase in reported gas prices. The increase in Tunisian revenues resulted from an increase in average daily sales volumes from successful drilling efforts and a 12 percent increase in average reported prices. South African revenues declined due to normal production decline rates in the Sable field and the timing of oil cargo liftings, partially offset by increases in average reported oil prices and initial gas production from the South Coast Gas project. The revenue increase during 2006, as compared to 2005, was due to a 70 percent increase in reported oil prices and an 11 percent increase in NGL prices. Partially offsetting the effects of increased oil and NGL prices was an 11 percent decrease in reported gas prices and a four percent decrease in average daily sales volumes on a BOE basis. A significant factor contributing to the increases in reported oil prices and decreases in reported oil sales volumes in 2006 as compared to 2005 was the initiation of first deliveries of oil volumes under the Companys VPP agreements in January 2006. VPP gas deliveries were initiated during February 2005 and declined by three percent during 2006, as compared to that of 2005. In accordance with GAAP, VPP deliveries result in VPP deferred revenue amortization being recognized in oil and gas revenues with no associated sales volumes being recorded. The following table provides average daily sales volumes from continuing operations by geographic area and in total, for 2007, 2006 and 2005: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Oil (Bbls): United States 18,643 17,716 21,942 South Africa 2,681 4,127 6,588 Tunisia 3,845 2,386 3,477 Worldwide 25,169 24,229 32,007 NGLs (Bbls): United States 18,553 18,488 17,403 Gas (Mcf): United States 316,418 284,732 271,033 South Africa 2,840 &mdash; &mdash; Tunisia 2,513 1,195 &mdash; Worldwide 321,771 285,927 271,033 Total (BOE): United States 89,933 83,659 84,517 South Africa 3,154 4,127 6,588 Tunisia 4,264 2,585 3,477 Worldwide 97,351 90,371 94,582 42 On a BOE basis, average daily production for 2007, as compared to 2006, increased by seven percent in the United States and by 65 percent in Tunisia, while average daily production decreased by 24 percent in South Africa. Average daily per BOE production for 2006, as compared to 2005, decreased by one percent in the United States, by 37 percent in South Africa and by 26 percent in Tunisia. During the year ended December 31, 2007, oil and gas volumes delivered under the Companys VPPs decreased by five percent, as compared to 2006. The following table provides average daily sales volumes from discontinued operations by geographic area and in total during 2007, 2006 and 2005: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Oil (Bbls): United States &mdash; 2,400 5,280 Argentina &mdash; 2,515 7,869 Canada 267 311 238 Worldwide 267 5,226 13,387 NGLs (Bbls): United States &mdash; &mdash; 65 Argentina &mdash; 421 1,824 Canada 371 463 615 Worldwide 371 884 2,504 Gas (Mcf): United States &mdash; 36,038 230,171 Argentina &mdash; 43,905 137,032 Canada 44,645 43,434 42,916 Worldwide 44,645 123,377 410,119 Total (BOE): United States &mdash; 8,406 43,707 Argentina &mdash; 10,253 32,531 Canada 8,080 8,013 8,005 Worldwide 8,080 26,672 84,243 43 The following table provides average reported prices from continuing operations, including the results of hedging activities and the amortization of VPP deferred revenue, and average realized prices from continuing operations, excluding the results of hedging activities and the amortization of VPP deferred revenue, by geographic area and in total, for 2007, 2006 and 2005: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Average reported prices: Oil (per Bbl): United States $ 63.78 $ 65.73 $ 32.01 South Africa $ 76.36 $ 65.92 $ 53.01 Tunisia $ 70.04 $ 63.16 $ 52.98 Worldwide $ 66.08 $ 65.51 $ 38.61 NGL (per Bbl): United States $ 41.60 $ 35.24 $ 31.72 Gas (per Mcf): United States $ 7.25 $ 6.15 $ 6.94 South Africa $ 6.76 $ &mdash; $ &mdash; Tunisia $ 8.77 $ 5.97 $ &mdash; Worldwide $ 7.26 $ 6.15 $ 6.94 Total (per BOE): United States $ 47.30 $ 42.64 $ 37.09 South Africa $ 70.98 $ 65.92 $ 53.01 Tunisia $ 68.33 $ 61.05 $ 52.98 Worldwide $ 48.99 $ 44.23 $ 38.78 Average realized prices: Oil (per Bbl): United States $ 70.26 $ 62.92 $ 54.05 South Africa $ 76.72 $ 65.74 $ 53.01 Tunisia $ 70.04 $ 63.16 $ 52.98 Worldwide $ 70.91 $ 63.42 $ 53.72 NGL (per Bbl): United States $ 41.60 $ 35.24 $ 31.72 Gas (per Mcf): United States $ 6.02 $ 5.96 $ 7.26 South Africa $ 6.76 $ &mdash; $ &mdash; Tunisia $ 8.77 $ 5.97 $ &mdash; Worldwide $ 6.04 $ 5.96 $ 7.26 Total (per BOE): United States $ 44.31 $ 41.37 $ 43.86 South Africa $ 71.29 $ 65.74 $ 53.01 Tunisia $ 68.33 $ 61.05 $ 52.98 Worldwide $ 46.24 $ 43.04 $ 44.84 Hedging activities. The Company, from time to time, utilizes commodity swap and collar contracts in order to (i) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities the Company produces and sells, (ii) support the Companys annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and (iii) reduce commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Companys commodity price hedges decreased oil and gas revenues from continuing operations by $83.5 million, $151.2 million and $284.8 million, respectively. The effective portions of changes in the fair values of the Companys commodity price hedges are deferred as increases or decreases to stockholders equity until the underlying hedged transaction occurs. Consequently, changes in the effective portions of commodity price hedges add volatility to the Companys reported stockholders equity until the hedge derivative matures or is terminated. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for information concerning the impact to oil and gas revenues during 2007, 2006 and 2005 from the Companys hedging activities, the Companys open and terminated hedge positions at December 31, 2007 and descriptions of the Companys commodity hedge derivatives. Also see 44 "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for additional disclosures about the Companys commodity related derivative financial instruments. Subsequent to December 31, 2007, the Company entered into additional commodity swap contracts for approximately 69,945 MMBtu per day of the Companys 2008 production at an average price of $7.28 per MMBtu. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for information concerning these changes in gas hedge positions. Deferred revenue. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Companys recognition of previously deferred VPP revenue increased oil and gas revenues from continuing operations by $181.2 million, $190.3 million and $75.8 million, respectively. The Companys amortization of deferred VPP revenue is scheduled to increase 2008 oil and gas revenues by $158.1 million. See Note T of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for specific information regarding the Companys VPPs. Interest and other income. The Companys interest and other income totaled $94.7 million, $48.4 million and $26.5 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The $46.3 million increase during 2007, as compared to 2006, is primarily attributable to (i) $74.9 million of 2007 Alaskan Petroleum Production Tax ("PPT") credit dispositions and (ii) a $4.8 million 2007 royalty obligation accrual adjustment, partially offset by (iii) an $11.3 million decrease in interest income, (iv) a $7.6 million reduction in business interruption insurance claims and (v) a $7.4 million decrease in derivative ineffectiveness income. The $21.9 million increase during 2006, as compared to 2005, is primarily attributable to (i) a $12.9 million increase in interest income primarily attributable to the investing the proceeds from the Argentine and deepwater Gulf of Mexico divestitures during 2006, (ii) $7.4 million of hedge ineffectiveness gains recorded during 2006 and (iii) $5.6 million of Alaskan exploration incentive credits received in 2006, offset by (iv) a $6.6 million decrease in business interruption insurance claims primarily attributable to the 2005 Fain plant fire in the West Panhandle field. In 2006, Alaska replaced its severance tax with the PPT for periods beginning after March 31, 2006. In late 2007, Alaska made further changes to the PPT through legislation referred to as "Alaskas Clear and Equitable Share" ("ACES"). The ACES modifications to PPT were effective as of July 1, 2007. Due to the Companys expenditures in Alaska and having no current production, the Company has generated PPT related carryforwards. At December 31, 2007, the Company had approximately $90 million of available PPT related carryforwards that may be monetized in the future. The Company anticipates recognizing further benefits from the PPT related carryforwards from (i) a reduction in PPT liabilities or (ii) sales of the carryforwards to third parties, if transferable, or reimbursement from the State of Alaska. The Company anticipates that any transfers of PPT related carryforwards to third parties would be at a discounted value, for which the amount of discount is currently not known. Gain (loss) on disposition of assets. The Company recorded a net loss on disposition of assets of $2.2 million in 2007, as compared to a net loss of $6.5 million in 2006 and a net gain of $60.1 million during 2005. In 2005, the gain was primarily related to (i) the sale of the stock of a subsidiary that owned the interest in the Olowi block in Gabon, which resulted in a $47.5 million gain and (ii) a $14 million property insurance settlement on the Companys East Cameron facility that was destroyed by Hurricane Rita, which resulted in a $9.7 million gain. During 2007, the Company recognized a gain on the sale of its Canadian assets of $101.3 million. During 2006, the Company recognized gains on the sale of its interest in certain oil and gas properties in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and its Argentina assets of approximately $736.2 million. During 2005, the Company recognized gains on the sale of certain assets in Canada and the shelf of the Gulf of Mexico of approximately $166.2 million. However, pursuant to SFAS 144, these gains and the results of operations from the assets are presented as discontinued operations. The net cash proceeds from asset divestitures during 2007, 2006 and 2005 were used, together with net cash flows provided by operating activities, to fund additions to oil and gas properties and stock repurchase programs, and to reduce outstanding indebtedness. See Notes N and V of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding asset divestitures. Oil and gas production costs. The Companys oil and gas production costs totaled $420.7 million, $349.1 million and $309.7 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In general, lease operating expenses and workover expenses represent the components of oil and gas production costs over which the Company has management control, while production taxes and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes. 45 Total production costs per BOE increased during 2007 by 12 percent as compared to 2006 primarily due to (i) general inflation of field service and supply costs associated with rising commodity prices, (ii) increased repair and clean up costs, and associated production downtime, from severe weather conditions that affected certain areas of the Companys United States operations during the first quarter of 2007, (iii) increased workover activity and (iv) fixed production costs associated with declining South African Sable oil production. Total production costs per BOE increased during 2006 by 18 percent as compared to 2005 primarily due to (i) the impact of a 126 percent increase in delivered volumes under VPP agreements, for which the Company bears all associated production costs and records no associated sales volumes (representing a per BOE production cost impact of approximately $1.50 during 2006 as compared to $.59 during 2005), (ii) general inflation of field service and supply costs and (iii) increases in production and ad valorem taxes and field utility costs due to increasing commodity and utility prices. The following tables provide the components of the Companys total production costs per BOE and total production costs per BOE by geographic area for 2007, 2006 and 2005: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Lease operating expenses $ 6.91 $ 5.94 $ 4.95 Third party transportation charges 0.97 0.79 0.64 Taxes: Ad valorem 1.23 1.35 1.17 Production 1.96 1.84 1.73 Workover costs 0.77 0.66 0.48 Total production costs $ 11.84 $ 10.58 $ 8.97 Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 United States $ 11.79 $ 10.61 $ 8.99 South Africa $ 22.43 $ 14.47 $ 11.79 Tunisia $ 5.14 $ 3.41 $ 3.20 Worldwide $ 11.84 $ 10.58 $ 8.97 Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense. The Companys total DD&A expense was $10.90, $9.52 and $7.76 per BOE for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Depletion expense, the largest component of DD&A expense, was $10.10, $8.80 and $7.19 per BOE during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. During 2007, the increase in per BOE depletion expense was primarily due to (i) a generally increasing trend in the Companys oil and gas properties cost bases per BOE of proved and proved developed reserves as a result of cost inflation in drilling rig rates and drilling supplies and (ii) first production of the South Coast gas project in South Africa, which has a higher depletion rate. During 2006, the increase in per BOE depletion expense was primarily due to (i) a generally increasing trend in the Companys oil and gas properties cost bases per BOE of proved and proved developed reserves as a result of cost inflation in drilling rig rates and drilling supplies, (ii) the sale of proved reserves under VPP agreements, for which the Company removed proved reserves with no corresponding decrease in cost basis, (iii) a $.50 per BOE increase in Tunisian depletion, primarily associated with 2006 and 2005 decreases in the Companys interest in the Adam Concession, offset by (iv) a $3.91 per BOE decrease in South Africa depletion, primarily associated with 2006 and 2005 positive revisions to proved reserves based on well performance. 46 The following table provides depletion expense per BOE from continuing operations by geographic area for 2007, 2006 and 2005: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 United States $ 10.27 $ 9.07 $ 7.10 South Africa $ 12.07 $ 6.28 $ 10.19 Tunisia $ 5.01 $ 4.25 $ 3.75 Worldwide $ 10.10 $ 8.80 $ 7.19 Impairment of long lived assets. The Company reviews its long lived assets to be held and used, including oil and gas properties, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company recognized aggregate noncash impairment charges of $26.2 million. During 2007, the Company recorded a charge of $10.3 million to write off the Companys remaining basis in Block H in Equatorial Guinea. The charge was recorded in connection with the ongoing arbitration among the parties participating in the Block H prospect. Another $10.2 million of the impairment charges relate to the Companys announced intent to dispose of its Nigerian subsidiary that held the interest in Block 320 and the resulting adjustment to reduce its carrying cost basis to Block 320s estimated fair value. During the second quarter of 2007, the Company also recognized a $5.7 million impairment charge to reduce the carrying values of certain oil and gas properties located in Louisiana due to poor well performance. During 2005, the Company recognized noncash impairment charges of $644 thousand to reduce the carrying value of its Gabonese Olowi field assets as development of the discovery was canceled. See "Critical Accounting Estimates" below and Notes B and S of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information pertaining to the Companys accounting policies regarding assessments of impairment and the Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria, Louisiana and Gabonese Olowi field impairments. Exploration, abandonments, geological and geophysical costs. The following table provides the Companys geological and geophysical costs, exploratory dry hole expense, leasehold abandonments and other exploration expense by geographic area for 2007, 2006 and 2005: United States South Africa Tunisia Other Total (in thousands) Year ended December 31, 2007 Geological and geophysical $ 91,547 $ 276 $ 2,812 $ 9,182 $ 103,817 Exploratory dry holes 119,638 &mdash; 13,931 13,851 147,420 Leasehold abandonments and other 20,453 &mdash; &mdash; 7,639 28,092 $ 231,638 $ 276 $ 16,743 $ 30,672 $ 279,329 Year ended December 31, 2006 Geological and geophysical $ 79,140 $ 289 $ 8,402 $ 21,536 $ 109,367 Exploratory dry holes 80,023 7,227 6,214 15,845 109,309 Leasehold abandonments and other 13,696 &mdash; &mdash; 17,824 31,520 $ 172,859 $ 7,516 $ 14,616 $ 55,205 $ 250,196 Year ended December 31, 2005 Geological and geophysical $ 63,707 $ 282 $ 1,857 $ 32,214 $ 98,060 Exploratory dry holes 24,462 804 9,041 9,135 43,442 Leasehold abandonments and other 8,957 125 &mdash; 3,195 12,277 $ 97,126 $ 1,211 $ 10,898 $ 44,544 $ 153,779 During 2007, significant components of the Companys exploratory dry hole provisions and leasehold abandonments expense included: (i) $72.1 million of suspended well costs written off due to the discontinuation of the Clipper project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico due to increasing costs, (ii) $13.8 million of costs associated with the Companys unsuccessful exploratory well on its Block 256 offshore Nigeria, (iii) $50.8 million for costs 47 associated with two unsuccessful exploratory wells in the Companys Alaskan NPRA area and the write off of the remaining prospect costs in the onshore North Slope area and (iv) $13.9 million of Tunisian dry hole provisions and abandonment costs, which primarily related to the write off of a suspended well drilled in 2003 on the Anaguid permit and an unsuccessful exploratory well in both the Jenein Nord permit and the Borj El Khadra permit. During 2007, the Companys seismic activity primarily related to its resource plays in South Texas and the Rocky Mountains. During 2007, the Company completed and evaluated 76 exploration/extension wells, 60 of which were successfully completed as discoveries. During 2006, significant components of the Companys dry hole provisions and leasehold abandonments expense included (i) $34.0 million of costs associated with the Companys unsuccessful exploratory well on its Block 256 prospect offshore Nigeria, including $17.8 million of associated unproved leasehold impairment, (ii) $21.6 million of dry hole provisions recorded for the Companys unsuccessful Cronus, Storms and Antigua prospects in the North Slope area of Alaska, (iii) $16.9 million of dry hole provisions and abandonment costs recognized on prospects drilled in prior periods that were being evaluated for commerciality, including $7.2 million of costs associated with the Companys Boomslang prospect offshore South Africa, $5.5 million of costs associated with two discoveries on the Gulf of Mexico shelf in 2005 and $4.2 million of costs associated with the Companys Anaguid permit in Tunisia, (iv) $16.0 million of dry hole provision and unproved property impairment recognized on the Companys unsuccessful Norphlet prospect in Mississippi and (v) a $14.3 million unsuccessful well on the Companys Flying Cloud prospect in the Gulf of Mexico. During 2006, the Company completed and evaluated 414 exploration/extension wells, 384 of which were successfully completed as discoveries. Significant components of the Companys dry hole expense during 2005 included (i) $21.2 million related to Alaskan well costs, (ii) $9.5 million associated with an unsuccessful Nigerian well, (iii) $3.5 million attributable to an unsuccessful suspended well in the Companys El Hamra permit in Tunisia, (iv) $5.1 million attributable to an unsuccessful suspended well in the Companys Anaguid permit in Tunisia and (v) various other exploratory wells. During 2005, the Company completed and evaluated 180 exploratory/extension wells, 149 of which were successfully completed as discoveries. General and administrative expense. General and administrative expense totaled $129.6 million, $116.6 million and $110.1 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expense during 2007, as compared to 2006, was primarily due to an increase in performance related compensation costs, including the amortization of share based awards to officers, directors and employees. As of December 31, 2007, the Company has $34.9 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested share based awards that will be charged to earnings over a weighted average period of approximately one year and five months. The Company continues to monitor its general and administrative expense and is focused on administrative cost control. If Pioneer Southwest completes its initial public offering, the Company expects that its general and administrative expenses would increase. The increase in general and administrative expense during 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to a full year effect of the 2005 staff increases associated with the Evergreen acquisition. Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations. Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations from continuing operations was $7.0 million, $3.7 million and $3.3 million for the years ending during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations during 2007 was primarily due to new wells placed on production from the 2007 drilling program and the carryover of the 2006 drilling program. See Note L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys asset retirement obligations. Interest expense. Interest expense was $135.3 million, $107.1 million and $126.0 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on the Companys indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 6.5 percent, as compared to 6.7 percent and 6.5 percent for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, including the effects of interest rate derivatives. The increase in interest expense for 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to (i) a $44.3 million increase in interest incurred on long term debt due to a $712 million increase in average debt outstanding, primarily related to funding additions to oil and gas properties, (ii) a $5.4 million increase in noncash interest expense attributable to certain discounted liabilities and deferred hedge losses partially offset by (iii) a $20.4 million increase in capitalized interest on the Companys Oooguruk and South Coast Gas development projects in Alaska and South Africa, respectively. The Company expects interest expense to increase in future periods due to the completion of the South Africa South Coast Gas project during the third quarter of 2007 and the Alaskan Oooguruk project facilities nearing completion, partially offset by declining interest rates on the Company credit facility. 48 The decrease in interest expense for 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily due to the repayment of portions of the Companys outstanding borrowings under the Companys credit facility with proceeds from the divestiture of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine assets and an $11.1 million increase in interest capitalized on the Companys Oooguruk and South Coast Gas development projects, partially offset by a $4.1 million decrease in the amortization of interest rate hedge gains. See Note F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information about the Companys long term debt and interest expense. Hurricane activity, net. The Company recorded net hurricane related activity expenses of $61.3 million, $32.0 million and $39.8 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, associated with the Companys East Cameron platform facility, located on the Gulf of Mexico shelf, that was destroyed during 2005 by Hurricane Rita. The Company estimates that it will cost approximately $185 million to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron facility. The operations to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron facilities began in January 2007. The estimate to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron facility is based upon an analysis prepared by a third party engineering firm for a majority of the work, an estimate by the Company for the remaining work that was not covered by the third party analysis and actual abandonment activity to date. The incremental $66.0 million increase in the reclamation and abandonment obligation during 2007 is primarily due to increasing the estimated time that it will take to complete certain aspects of the reclamation and abandonment project based on recent project work experience. During the third quarter of 2007, the Company commenced legal actions against its insurance carriers regarding certain policy coverage issues. However, the Company continues to expect that a substantial portion of the loss will be recoverable by insurance. See Note U of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information about the Companys East Cameron facility reclamation and abandonment. Other expenses. Other expenses were $31.9 million during 2007, as compared to $36.9 million during 2006 and $80.7 million during 2005. The $5.1 million decrease in other expense during 2007, as compared to 2006, is primarily attributable to (i) an $11.2 million decrease in the Companys postretirement benefit obligations, (ii) an $8.1 million decrease in losses on early extinguishments of debt, (iii) a $6.5 million decrease in non hedge derivative charges and (iv) a $4.0 million decrease in insurance charges, partially offset by (v) a $12.7 million increase in charges related to commodity hedge ineffectiveness and (vi) an $8.4 million increase in the cost of idle drilling equipment. The $43.8 million decrease in other expenses during 2006, as compared to 2005, is primarily attributable to (i) a $40.4 million decrease in hedge ineffectiveness charges and (ii) an $18.4 million decrease in loss on early extinguishment of portions of the Companys senior notes, partially offset by (iii) a $4.4 million increase in bad debt expense, (iv) a $4.0 million insurance charge, (v) a $2.7 million increase in non hedge derivative charges and (vi) $3.4 million of other net increases in other expense components. Income tax provision. The Company recognized income tax provisions on continuing operations of $112.6 million, $141.0 million and $149.2 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Companys effective tax rates for 2007, 2006 and 2005 were 32 percent, 48 percent and 45 percent, respectively, as compared to the combined United States federal and state statutory rates of approximately 37 percent. The effective tax rates of 2007, 2006 and 2005 differ from the combined United States federal and state statutory rates primarily due to: &bull; foreign tax rates; &bull; statutes in foreign jurisdictions that differ from those in the United States, including a newly enacted South African tax law allowing for the deduction of 150 percent of development expenditures, resulting in a $15.7 million tax benefit in 2007; &bull; an $8.8 million tax benefit in 2007 related to the reversal of Tunisian deferred tax asset valuation allowances previously taken on the Companys Cherouq concession and the recognition of additional tax benefits for costs inherited from the previous owners of the Jenein Nord permit, which management now believes is more likely than not to be realized in the future from forecasted operations; &bull; a $40.9 million tax benefit during 2007 related to the Companys exit from Nigeria; &bull; a $13.8 million tax benefit during 2007 related to the Companys relinquishment of its remaining rights in Gabon and the write off of costs associated with Block H in Equatorial Guinea; &bull; an $18.9 million U.S. tax provision during 2007 related to the Company no longer having identifiable plans to reinvest South Africa earnings in South Africa; 49 &bull; recognition of $8.4 million of deferred tax benefit during 2006 as a result of the conversion of senior convertible notes prior to the Companys repayment of the debt principal; &bull; recognition of $7.2 million of taxes during 2005 associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004; and &bull; expenses for unsuccessful well costs and associated acreage costs in foreign locations where the Company does not expect to receive income tax benefits, principally attributable to unsuccessful wells in Nigeria during 2006 and 2007. See "Critical Accounting Estimates" below and Note P of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys tax position. Discontinued operations. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company sold its interests in the following oil and gas asset groups: Country Description of Asset Groups Date Divested Canada Martin Creek, Conroy Black and Lookout Butte fields May 2005 United States Two Gulf of Mexico shelf fields August 2005 United States Deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields March 2006 Argentina Argentine assets April 2006 Canada Canadian assets November 2007 The Company recognized income from discontinued operations of $130.7 million during 2007 as compared to $589.5 million during 2006 and $350.3 million during 2005. Pursuant to SFAS 144, the results of operations of these assets and the related gains on disposition are reported as discontinued operations. See Notes V and W of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included herein for additional data on discontinued operations. Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity Capital commitments. The Companys primary needs for cash are for exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties, repayment of contractual obligations and working capital obligations. Funding for exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties and repayment of contractual obligations may be provided by any combination of internally generated cash flow, proceeds from the disposition of nonstrategic assets or alternative financing sources as discussed in "Capital resources" and "Financing activities" below. Generally, funding for the Companys working capital obligations is provided by internally generated cash flows. Oil and gas properties. The Companys cash expenditures for additions to oil and gas properties during 2007, 2006 and 2005 totaled $2.1 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. The Companys 2007 expenditures for additions to oil and gas properties were funded by $775.3 million of net cash provided by operating activities, the net proceeds from the disposition of Canadian assets and borrowings on the Companys line of credit. The Companys 2006 expenditures for additions to oil and gas properties were funded by $754.8 million of net cash provided by operating activities and by a portion of the net proceeds from the disposition of deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine assets. The Companys 2005 expenditures for additions to oil and gas properties were internally funded by $1.3 billion of net cash provided by operating activities. The Company strives to maintain its indebtedness at levels which will provide sufficient financial flexibility to take advantage of future opportunities. The Companys capital budget for 2008 is approximately $1.0 billion. The Company currently expects that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund the capital budget. Off balance sheet arrangements. From time to time, the Company enters into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off balance sheet obligations of the Company. As of December 31, 2007, the material off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that the Company has entered into include (i) undrawn letters of credit, (ii) operating lease agreements, (iii) drilling commitments, (iv) VPP obligations (to physically deliver volumes and pay related lease operating expenses in the future) and (v) contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable, such as derivative contracts that are sensitive to future changes in commodity prices and gas transportation commitments. Other than the off balance sheet arrangements described above, the Company has no transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the Companys liquidity or 50 availability of or requirements for capital resources. See "Contractual obligations" below for more information regarding the Companys off balance sheet arrangements. Contractual obligations. The Companys contractual obligations include long term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments (including commitments to pay day rates for drilling rigs), derivative obligations, other liabilities, transportation commitments and VPP obligations. The following table summarizes by period the payments due by the Company for contractual obligations estimated as of December 31, 2007: Payments Due by Year 2008 2009 and 2010 2011 and 2012 Thereafter (in thousands) Long term debt (a) $ 3,777 $ &mdash; $ 1,119,110 $ 1,726,875 Operating leases (b) 28,913 26,126 22,496 75,907 Drilling commitments (c) 190,155 179,570 8,065 &mdash; Derivative obligations (d) 228,577 77,245 &mdash; &mdash; Other liabilities (e) 140,206 37,334 8,188 146,329 Transportation commitments (f) 26,086 50,607 36,103 31,967 VPP obligations (g) 158,138 238,121 87,021 &mdash; $ 775,852 $ 609,003 $ 1,280,983 $ 1,981,078 (a) See Note F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data". The amounts included in the table above represent principal maturities only. (b) See Note I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data". (c) Drilling commitments represent future minimum expenditure commitments for drilling rig services and well commitments under contracts to which the Company was a party on December 31, 2007. (d) Derivative obligations represent net liabilities for oil and gas commodity derivatives that were valued as of December 31, 2007. These liabilities include $69.9 million of liabilities that are fixed in amount and are not subject to continuing market risk. The ultimate settlement amounts of the remaining portions of the Companys derivative obligations are unknown because they are subject to continuing market risk. See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys derivative obligations. (e) The Companys other liabilities represent current and noncurrent other liabilities that are comprised of postretirement benefit obligations, litigation and environmental contingencies, asset retirement obligations and other obligations for which neither the ultimate settlement amounts nor their timings can be precisely determined in advance. See Notes H, I and L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys postretirement benefit obligations, litigation and environmental contingencies and asset retirement obligations, respectively. (f) Transportation commitments represent estimated transportation fees on gas throughput commitments. See Note I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys transportation commitments. (g) These amounts represent the amortization of the deferred revenue associated with the VPPs. The Companys ongoing obligation is to deliver the specified volumes sold under the VPPs free and clear of all associated production costs and capital expenditures. See Note T of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data". Capital resources. The Companys primary capital resources are net cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from financing activities and proceeds from sales of nonstrategic assets. The Company expects that these resources will be sufficient to fund its capital commitments for the foreseeable future. For 2007, the Companys capital commitments exceeded estimated cash flows from operations, resulting in additional borrowings under the Companys credit facility. For 2008, the Company currently expects that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund the Companys $1.0 billion capital budget. Asset divestitures. In November 2007, the Company sold all of the common stock of its Canadian subsidiaries for net proceeds of $525.7 million. The proceeds from the sale were utilized to reduce amounts outstanding under the Companys credit facility. Associated therewith, the Company reported a gain of $101.3 51 million during the fourth quarter of 2007. The results of operations for the Canadian assets are included in the Companys discontinued operations. During March 2006, the Company sold all of its interests in certain oil and gas properties in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for net proceeds of $1.2 billion, resulting in a gain of $725.3 million. During April 2006, the Company sold its Argentine assets for net proceeds of $669.6 million, resulting in a gain of $10.9 million. The results of operations for these divestitures are included in the Companys discontinued operations. The net cash proceeds from these divestitures were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness under the Companys credit facility, to fund a portion of additions to oil and gas properties, for stock repurchases and for general corporate purposes. During May 2005, the Company sold all of its interests in the Martin Creek, Conroy Black and Lookout Butte oil and gas properties in Canada for net proceeds of $197.2 million, resulting in a gain of $138.3 million. During August 2005, the Company sold all of its interests in certain oil and gas properties on the Gulf of Mexico shelf for net proceeds of $59.2 million, resulting in a gain of $27.9 million. During October 2005, the Company sold all of its shares in a subsidiary that owns the interest in the Olowi block in Gabon for net proceeds of $47.9 million, resulting in a gain of $47.5 million. The net cash proceeds from the 2005 divestitures were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness. During 2005, the Company sold 27.8 MMBOE of proved reserves, by means of three VPPs for net proceeds of $892.6 million, including the assignment of the Companys obligations under certain derivative hedge agreements. Proceeds from the VPPs were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness. See Note T of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys VPPs. Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities during 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $775.3 million, $754.8 million and $1.3 billion, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2007, as compared to that of 2006, was primarily due to increased sales volumes, increased commodity prices and $74.9 million of income realized from the disposal of Alaskan PPT credits, offset by the cash provided by operating activities associated with the 2006 deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine asset dispositions and the 2007 disposal of the Canadian assets. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2006, as compared to that of 2005, was primarily due to the loss of cash flow from the aforementioned asset divestitures. Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities during 2007 was $1.8 billion, as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $145.5 million and $84.7 million during 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by investing activities during 2007, as compared to 2006, was primarily due to $1.6 billion of net proceeds received from the divestiture of assets during 2006, the substantial portion of which resulted from the sale of the Companys deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine assets, and a $663.8 million increase in additions to oil and gas properties during 2007. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities during 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to a $396.2 million increase in proceeds from disposition of assets, partially offset by a $280.6 million increase in additions to oil and gas properties. See "Results of Operations" above and Note N of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding asset divestitures. Financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2007 was $1.0 billion, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $913.5 million and $1.4 billion during 2006 and 2005, respectively. During 2007, significant components of financing activities included $1.3 billion of net borrowings under long term debt and $221.4 million of net cash used to purchase 5.2 million shares of treasury stock. During 2006, significant components of financing activities included $554.7 million of net cash used to repay long term borrowings, $348.9 million of net cash used to purchase 8.9 million shares of stock and $31.7 million of dividend payments, partially offset by $17.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of long term incentive plan stock options and employee stock purchases. During 2005, financing activities were comprised of $353.6 million of net principal repayments on long term debt, $60.1 million of payments of other noncurrent liabilities, primarily comprised of cash settlements of acquired hedge obligations, $30.3 million of dividends paid and $949.3 million of stock repurchases, partially offset by $41.6 million of proceeds from the exercise of long term incentive plan stock options and employee stock purchases. During September 2005, the Company announced that the board of directors had approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $1 billion of the Companys common stock. During 2006 and 2005, the Company expended a total of $348.9 million to acquire 8.9 million shares of stock and $949.3 million to acquire 20.0 million shares of stock, respectively, of which $345.3 million and $640.7 million, respectively, were 52 repurchased pursuant to the $1 billion repurchase program. In 2007, the Board authorized share repurchases of up to $750 million of the Companys common stock. Through December 31, 2007, the Company had repurchased $212.8 million of common stock under this 2007 authorized program. On January 15, 2008, $3.8 million principal amount of the Companys 6.50% senior notes matured and were repaid with borrowings under its credit facility. On August 15, 2007, $32.1 million principal amount of the Companys 8.25% senior notes matured and were also repaid with borrowings under the Companys credit facility. During April 2007, the Company amended its existing Amended and Restated $1.5 billion 5 Year Revolving Credit Agreement with an Amended and Restated 5 Year Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Credit Facility") to extend the maturity and improve the pricing. The Credit Facility provides for initial aggregate loan commitments of $1.5 billion, which may be increased to a maximum aggregate amount of $2.0 billion if the lenders increase their loan commitments or if loan commitments of new financial institutions are added. See Note F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the significant terms of the amended credit facility. During January 2008, the Company entered into interest rate swap contracts and designated the contracts as cash flow hedges of the forecasted interest rate risk associated with a portion of the Companys Credit Facility indebtedness. The interest rate swap contracts are variable for fixed rate swaps on $400 million notional amount of debt at a weighted average fixed annual rate of 2.87 percent, excluding any applicable margins. The interest rate swaps have an effective start date during February, 2008, $200 million of which terminate during February 2010 and $200 million during February 2011. During March 2007, the Company issued $500 million of 6.65% senior notes due 2017 for net proceeds of $494.8 million. The Company used the net proceeds from the 6.65% senior notes to reduce indebtedness under its credit facility. During May 2006, the Company issued $450 million of 6.875% senior notes due 2018 for net proceeds of $447.4 million. The Company used the net proceeds, in part, from the 6.875% senior notes to repurchase $346.2 million of its 6.50% senior notes due 2008 and for general corporate purposes. During 2006, holders of all of the $100 million of 4 3/4% senior convertible notes due 2021 exercised their conversion rights. Associated therewith, the Company paid $79.9 million in cash, issued 2.3 million shares of common stock and recorded a $22.0 million increase to stockholders equity. During April 2005, $131.0 million of the Companys 8 7/8% senior notes due 2005 matured and were repaid. During 2005, the Company also redeemed the remaining $64.0 million and $16.2 million, respectively, of aggregate principal amount of its 9 5/8% senior notes due 2010 and its 7.50% senior notes due 2012. During September 2005, the Company accepted tenders to purchase $188.4 million in principal amount of the 5.875% senior notes due 2012 for $199.9 million. The Company utilized unused borrowing capacity under its credit facility to fund these financing activities. During 2007, the Companys board of directors declared total dividends of $.27 per common share. Associated therewith, the Company paid $16.0 million of aggregate dividends during April 2007 and $16.8 million of aggregate dividends during October 2007. Future dividends are at the discretion of the Board, and, if declared, the Board may change the current dividend amount, including in response to the Companys liquidity and capital resources at the time. In 2007, Pioneer Southwest filed a preliminary registration statement (subject to completion) with the SEC to sell limited partner interests. If the offering is completed, Pioneer Southwest would own interests in certain oil and gas properties currently owned by the Company in the Spraberry field in the Permian Basin of West Texas. Pioneer Southwests registration statement contemplates an offering of 35.3 percent (before underwriters over allotment option) of its limited partner interests to the public (the "Offering"). The Offering has been postponed due to market conditions and timing of the Offering remains uncertain. Completion of the Offering is subject to market conditions and numerous other risks beyond the control of Pioneer Southwest, and therefore it is possible that the Offering will not be completed, will not raise the planned amount of capital even if the Offering is completed, or will not be completed when planned. In October 2007, Pioneer Southwest entered into a $300 million unsecured revolving credit facility ("PSE Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of banks. The PSE Credit Agreement would mature five years following the closing of the Offering and would contain certain financial covenants that would be applicable to Pioneer Southwest. As a result of the most restrictive covenant, borrowings under the PSE Credit Agreement would be 53 expected to be initially limited to approximately $150 million. It is a condition to the obligations of the lenders under the PSE Credit Agreement that Pioneer Southwest completes the Offering. Pioneer Southwest is seeking an extension of the facility from the lenders. There can be no assurance that the lenders will agree to an extension, or if they do agree, that the terms of the facility will remain unchanged. If Pioneer Southwest were to seek a replacement facility, there can be no assurance that it would be able to do so or if it were successful, that the terms would be as favorable to Pioneer Southwest as the terms under the PSE Credit Agreement. See Notes F and W of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information on the Pioneer Southwest credit facility and initial public offering. As the Company pursues its strategy, it may utilize various financing sources, including fixed and floating rate debt, convertible securities, preferred stock or common stock. The Company may also issue securities in exchange for oil and gas properties, stock or other interests in other oil and gas companies or related assets. Additional securities may be of a class preferred to common stock with respect to such matters as dividends and liquidation rights and may also have other rights and preferences as determined by the Board. Liquidity. The Companys principal source of short term liquidity is cash on hand and unused borrowing capacity under its credit facility. There were $1.1 billion of outstanding borrowings under the credit facility as of December 31, 2007. Including $80 million of undrawn and outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility, the Company had $307 million of unused borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2007. In January 2008, the Company issued $500 million of 2.875% senior convertible notes ("2.875% Convertible Notes"). The notes will be convertible under certain circumstances using a net share settlement process into a combination of cash and Pioneer common stock pursuant to a formula. The Company used the net proceeds from the 2.875% Convertible Notes to reduce indebtedness under its credit facility. Foreign currency translation. The functional currency of the Companys Canadian subsidiaries was the U.S. dollar ("USD") and the Canadian subsidiaries financial statements were maintained in Canadian dollars ("CND"). In accordance with GAAP, the net assets of the Canadian subsidiaries were translated into USD equivalent amounts when they were consolidated into the financial statements of the Company and resulting translation gains and losses were deferred as items of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the Companys consolidated stockholders equity. As a result of modest fluctuations in the USD to CND exchange rates during 2005 and 2006, the Company recorded other comprehensive income (loss) in accumulated other comprehensive income &ndash; cumulative translation adjustment ("AOCI &ndash; CTA") in consolidated stockholders equity of $8.1 million and $(6.6) million, respectively. However, during 2007 the CND strengthened significantly against the USD, associated with which the Company recorded $77.7 million of other comprehensive income in AOCI &ndash; CTA. During November 2007, the sale of the Companys common stock in the Canadian subsidiaries was completed, at which time AOCI &ndash; CTA was eliminated as a component of the gain on the divestiture of the Canadian assets. See Note V of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the divestiture of the Canadian subsidiaries. Debt ratings. The Company receives debt credit ratings from Standard & Poors Ratings Group, Inc. ("S&P") and Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"), which are subject to regular reviews. S&Ps rating for the Company is BB+ with a stable outlook. Moodys rating for the Company is Ba1 with a negative outlook. S&P and Moodys consider many factors in determining the Companys ratings including: production growth opportunities, liquidity, debt levels and asset and reserve mix. A reduction in the Companys debt ratings could negatively impact the Companys ability to obtain additional financing or the interest rate, fees and other terms associated with such additional financing. As of December 31, 2007, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants. Book capitalization and current ratio. The Companys book capitalization at December 31, 2007 was $5.8 billion, consisting of debt of $2.8 billion and stockholders equity of $3.0 billion. The Companys debt to book capitalization increased to 48 percent at December 31, 2007 from 33 percent at December 31, 2006, primarily due to increased indebtedness which was used to fund the Companys additions to oil and gas properties and stock repurchases. The Companys debt to book capitalization at December 31, 2005 was 48 percent and decreased to 33 percent at December 31, 2006. The decrease was principally due to the reduction of debt from the application of the proceeds received from the divestiture of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets and Argentine assets in 2006. The Companys ratio of current assets to current liabilities was .77 to 1.00 at December 31, 2007, as compared to .60 to 1.00 at December 31, 2006. 54 Critical Accounting Estimates The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements for inclusion in this Report in accordance with GAAP. See Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a comprehensive discussion of the Companys significant accounting policies. GAAP represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements, the application of which requires management judgments and estimates including, in certain circumstances, choices between acceptable GAAP alternatives. Following is a discussion of the Companys most critical accounting estimates, judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the Companys application of GAAP. Asset retirement obligations. The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and facilities and to restore the land or seabeds at the end of oil and gas production operations. The Companys removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligations, a corresponding adjustment is generally made to the oil and gas property balance. See Notes B and L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys asset retirement obligations. Successful efforts method of accounting. The Company utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities as opposed to the alternate acceptable full cost method. In general, the Company believes that, during periods of active exploration, net assets and net income are more conservatively measured under the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities than under the full cost method. The critical difference between the successful efforts method of accounting and the full cost method is as follows: under the successful efforts method, exploratory dry holes and geological and geophysical exploration costs are charged against earnings during the periods in which they occur; whereas, under the full cost method of accounting, such costs and expenses are capitalized as assets, pooled with the costs of successful wells and charged against the earnings of future periods as a component of depletion expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recognized exploration, abandonment, geological and geophysical expense from (i) continuing operations of $279.3 million, $250.2 million and $153.8 million, respectively, and (ii) discontinued operations of $14.4 million, $21.3 million and $73.4 million, respectively, under the successful efforts method. Proved reserve estimates. Estimates of the Companys proved reserves included in this Report are prepared in accordance with GAAP and SEC guidelines. The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of: &bull; the quality and quantity of available data; &bull; the interpretation of that data; &bull; the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and &bull; the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate. The Companys proved reserve information included in this Report as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were prepared by the Companys engineers and audited by independent petroleum engineers with respect to the Companys major properties. Estimates prepared by third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein. Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, all of which may substantially differ from future actual results, reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify, positively or negatively, material revisions to the estimate of proved reserves. It should not be assumed that the Standardized Measure included in this Report as of December 31, 2007 is the current market value of the Companys estimated proved reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the Company based the Standardized Measure on prices and costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and 55 costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves. The Companys estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion expense. If the estimates of proved reserves decline, the rate at which the Company records depletion expense will increase, reducing future net income. Such a decline may result from lower market prices, which may make it uneconomical to drill for and produce higher cost fields. In addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of the Companys assessment of its proved properties and goodwill for impairment. Impairment of proved oil and gas properties. The Company reviews its proved properties to be held and used whenever management determines that events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable. Management assesses whether or not an impairment provision is necessary based upon its outlook of future commodity prices and net cash flows that may be generated by the properties and if a significant downward revision has occurred to the estimated proved reserves. Proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment at the level at which depletion of proved properties is calculated. Impairment of unproved oil and gas properties. At December 31, 2007, the Company carried unproved property costs of $277.5 million. Management periodically assesses unproved oil and gas properties for impairment, on a project by project basis. Managements assessment of the results of exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects impacts the amount and timing of impairment provisions, if any. Suspended wells. The Company suspends the costs of exploratory wells that discover hydrocarbons pending a final determination of the commercial potential of the oil and gas discovery. The ultimate disposition of these well costs is dependent on the results of future drilling activity and development decisions. If the Company decides not to pursue additional appraisal activities or development of these fields, the costs of these wells will be charged to exploration and abandonment expense. The Company generally does not carry the costs of drilling an exploratory well as an asset in its Consolidated Balance Sheets for more than one year following the completion of drilling unless the exploratory well finds oil and gas reserves in an area requiring a major capital expenditure and both of the following conditions are met: (i) The well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well. (ii) The Company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Due to the capital intensive nature and the geographical location of certain projects, it may take the Company longer than one year to evaluate the future potential of the exploration well and economics associated with making a determination on its commercial viability. In these instances, the projects feasibility is not contingent upon price improvements or advances in technology, but rather the Companys ongoing efforts and expenditures related to accurately predicting the hydrocarbon recoverability based on well information, gaining access to other companies production, transportation or processing facilities and or getting partner approval to drill additional appraisal wells. These activities are ongoing and being pursued constantly. Consequently, the Companys assessment of suspended exploratory well costs is continuous until a decision can be made that the well has found proved reserves or is noncommercial and is impaired. See Note D of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys suspended exploratory well costs. Assessments of functional currencies. Management determines the functional currencies of the Companys subsidiaries based on an assessment of the currency of the economic environment in which a subsidiary primarily realizes and expends its operating revenues, costs and expenses. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of all of the Companys current international operations. The assessment of functional currencies can have a significant impact on periodic results of operations and financial position. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances. The Company continually assesses both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be realized prior to their expiration. Pioneer monitors Company specific, oil and gas industry and worldwide economic factors and reassesses the likelihood that the Companys net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax attributes in each jurisdiction will be utilized prior to their expiration. There can be no assurance that facts and circumstances will not materially change and require the Company to establish deferred tax asset valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions in a future period. As of December 31, 2007, the Company does not believe there is sufficient positive evidence to reverse its valuation allowances related to certain foreign tax jurisdictions. 56 Goodwill impairment. The Company reviews its goodwill for impairment at least annually. This requires the Company to estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting units that have goodwill. There is considerable judgment involved in estimating fair values, particularly in the estimation of proved reserves as described above. See Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information. Litigation and environmental contingencies. The Company makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for ongoing litigation and environmental remediation. Actual costs can vary from such estimates for a variety of reasons. The costs to settle litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws and opinions and assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, environmental remediation liabilities are subject to change because of changes in laws and regulations, developing information relating to the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology. Under GAAP, a liability is recorded for these types of contingencies if the Company determines the loss to be both probable and reasonably estimable. See Note I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys commitments and contingencies. Valuations of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans. The Company is the sponsor of certain defined benefit pension and postretirement plans. In accordance with GAAP, the Company is required to estimate the present value of its unfunded pension and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations. Based on those values, the Company records the unfunded obligations of those plans and records ongoing service costs and associated interest expense. The valuation of the Companys pension and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations requires management assumptions and judgments as to benefit cost inflation factors, mortality rates and discount factors. Changes in these factors may materially change future benefit costs and pension and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations. See "New Accounting Pronouncements" below and Note H of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys pension and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations. Valuation of stock based compensation. The Company adopted the "modified prospective" approach as prescribed under SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006. Under this approach, the Company is required to expense all options and other stock based compensation that vested during the year of adoption based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. The calculation of the fair value of stock based compensation requires the use of estimates to derive the inputs necessary for using the various valuation methods utilized by the Company. The Company utilizes (a) the Black Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options, (b) the stock price on the date of grant for the fair value of restricted stock awards and (c) the Monte Carlo simulation method for the fair value of performance unit awards. New Accounting Pronouncements The following discussions provide information about new accounting pronouncements that were issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") during 2007: SFAS 157. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS 157"). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measures required under other accounting pronouncements, but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The implementation of SFAS 157 will not have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. SFAS 159. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" ("SFAS 159"). SFAS 159 permits entities to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. SFAS 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The implementation of SFAS 159 is not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. SFAS 141(R). In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141"). SFAS 141(R) replaces SFAS 141 and provides greater consistency in the accounting and financial reporting of business combinations. SFAS 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at the fair value as of that date. This includes the measurement of the acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business combination, the recognition of contingent consideration, the accounting for pre acquisition gain and loss contingencies, the recognition of capitalized in process research and development, the 57 accounting for acquisition related restructuring cost accruals, the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs and the recognition of changes in the acquirers income tax valuation allowance and deferred taxes. SFAS 141(R) is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and is to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the statement is applied. The implementation of SFAS 141(R) is not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. SFAS 160. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160 "Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB Statement No. 51" ("SFAS 160"). SFAS 160 amends Accounting Research Bulletin ("ARB") No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements," to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, which is sometimes referred to as minority interest, is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements. Among other requirements, SFAS 160 requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest. It also requires disclosure, on the face of the consolidated income statement, of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the non controlling interest. SFAS 160 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2009 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements. 58 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following quantitative and qualitative information is provided about financial instruments to which the Company was a party as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and from which the Company may incur future gains or losses from changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. Although certain derivative contracts to which the Company has been a party did not qualify as hedges, the Company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading purposes. The fair value of the Companys derivative contracts is determined based on counterparties estimates and valuation models. The Company did not change its valuation method during 2007. During 2007, the Company was a party to commodity, interest rate and foreign exchange rate swap contracts and commodity collar contracts. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Companys derivative contracts, including deferred gains and losses on terminated derivative contracts. The following table reconciles the changes that occurred in the fair values of the Companys open derivative contracts during 2007: Derivative Contract Net Liabilities (a) Commodities Interest Rate Foreign Exchange Rate Total (in thousands) Fair value of contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2006 $ (68,228 ) $ &mdash; $ &mdash; $ (68,228 ) Changes in contract fair values (b) (160,839 ) (1,537 ) (1,500 ) (163,876 ) Contract maturities (70,772 ) &mdash; (61 ) (70,833 ) Contract terminations 65,429 1,537 61 67,027 Fair value of contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2007 $ (234,410 ) $ &mdash; $ (1,500 ) $ (235,910 ) (a) Represents the fair values of open derivative contracts subject to market risk. The Company also had $69.9 million and $131.1 million of obligations under terminated derivatives as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, for which no market risk exists. (b) At inception, new derivative contracts entered into by the Company have no intrinsic value. Quantitative Disclosures Foreign exchange rate sensitivity. Prior to its sale, the Companys Canadian subsidiary entered into short term forward currency agreements to purchase Canadian dollars with U.S. dollar gas sales proceeds. The Company did not designate these derivatives as hedges due to their short term nature. During November 2007, the Company invested $131.7 million Canadian dollars ("CND") in a CND denominated escrow account associated with the sale of the Companys Canadian assets (see Notes V of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the sale of the Companys Canadian assets). During December 2007, the Company entered into foreign exchange rate derivatives to swap $131.7 million CND for $131.0 million U.S. dollars ("USD") to be delivered during May 2008. As of December 31, 2007, the fair value of the foreign exchange rate swap contracts was a liability of $1.5 million. The foreign exchange rate swaps were economic hedges of the CND denominated escrow account balance; however, uncertainty regarding the matching of cash flow timing between the foreign exchange rate swaps and the liquidation of the CND denominated escrow account caused the Company not to designate the foreign exchange rate swaps as hedges. The CND denominated escrow account was liquidated during January 2008 for $129.0 million USD, at which time the foreign exchange rate swaps were terminated at a gain of $1.8 million. Subsequent to these transactions, the Company has no remaining material foreign exchange rate risk associated with financial instruments. Interest rate sensitivity. The following tables provide information about other financial instruments to which the Company was a party as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 that were sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the tables present maturities by expected maturity dates, the weighted average interest rates expected to be paid on the debt given current contractual terms and market conditions and the debts estimated fair 59 value. For fixed rate debt, the weighted average interest rate represents the contractual fixed rates that the Company was obligated to periodically pay on the debt as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. For variable rate debt, the average interest rate represents the average rates being paid on the debt projected forward proportionate to the forward yield curve for LIBOR on February 8, 2008. As of December 31, 2007, the Company was not a party to material derivatives that would subject it to interest rate sensitivity. Interest Rate Sensitivity Debt Obligations as of December 31, 2007 Year Ending December 31, Liability Fair Value December 31, 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total 2007 (dollars in thousands) Total Debt: Fixed rate principal maturities (a) $ 3,777 $ &mdash; $ &mdash; $ &mdash; $ 6,110 $ 1,726,875 $ 1,736,762 $ 1,537,630 Weighted average interest rate 6.55 % 6.55 % 6.55 % 6.55 % 6.55 % 6.76 % Variable rate principal maturities (b) $ &mdash; $ &mdash; $ &mdash; $ &mdash; $ 1,113,000 $ &mdash; $ 1,113,000 $ 1,113,000 Weighted average interest rate 3.51 % 3.91 % 4.78 % 5.38 % 5.48 % &mdash; % (a) Represents maturities of principal amounts excluding (i) debt issuance discounts and premiums and (ii) deferred fair value hedge gains and losses. (b) During January 2008, the Company entered into $400 million notional amount of floating for fixed interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with variable rate indebtedness at a fixed weighted average annual interest rate of 2.87 percent, excluding any applicable margins. The interest rate swaps mature during February 2010 ($200 million notional amount) and 2011 ($200 million notional amount). Interest Rate Sensitivity Debt Obligations as of December 31, 2006 Year Ending December 31, Liability Fair Value December 31, 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total 2006 (dollars in thousands) Total Debt: Fixed rate principal maturities (a) $ 32,075 $ 3,777 $ &mdash; $ &mdash; $ &mdash; $ 1,232,985 $ 1,268,837 $ 1,244,846 Weighted average interest rate 6.64 % 6.25 % 6.51 % 6.51 % 6.51 % 6.51 % Variable rate principal maturities $ &mdash; $ &mdash; $ &mdash; $ 22,960 $ 305,040 $ &mdash; $ 328,000 $ 328,000 Weighted average interest rate (b) 6.23 % 5.87 % 5.88 % 5.96 % 6.28 % &mdash; % (a) Represents maturities of principal amounts excluding (i) debt issuance discounts and premiums and (ii) deferred fair value hedge gains and losses. (b) Represents the average rates being paid on debt projected forward proportionate to the forward yield curve for LIBOR on February 19, 2007. Commodity price sensitivity. The following tables provide information about the Companys oil and gas derivative financial instruments that were sensitive to changes in oil, NGL and gas prices as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, substantially all of the Companys oil, NGL and gas derivative financial instruments qualified as hedges. 60 Commodity hedge instruments. The Company hedges commodity price risk with derivative contracts, such as swap and collar contracts. Swap contracts provide a fixed price for a notional amount of sales volumes. Collar contracts provide minimum ("floor") and maximum ("ceiling") prices for the Company on a notional amount of sales volumes, thereby allowing some price participation if the relevant index price closes above the floor price. See Notes B, E and J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a description of the accounting procedures followed by the Company relative to hedge derivative financial instruments and for specific information regarding the terms of the Companys derivative financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in oil, NGL or gas prices. Oil Price Sensitivity Derivative Financial Instruments as of December 31, 2007 Year Ending December 31, Liability Fair Value at December 31, 2008 2009 2010 2007 (in thousands) Oil Hedge Derivatives: Average daily notional Bbl volumes (a): Swap contracts 15,250 8,000 4,000 $ 237,071 Weighted average fixed price per Bbl $ 61.36 $ 71.57 $ 71.46 Collar contracts 3,000 2,000 &mdash; $ 24,517 Weighted average ceiling price per Bbl $ 80.80 $ 76.50 $ &mdash; Weighted average floor price per Bbl $ 65.00 $ 65.00 $ &mdash; Average forward NYMEX oil prices (b) $ 97.22 $ 92.62 $ 90.88 (a) See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8.

These forward prices represent estimates as of February 15, 2008 provided by third parties who actively trade in the derivatives. Accordingly, these prices are subject to estimates and assumptions. Gas Price Sensitivity Derivative Financial Instruments as of December 31, 2007 Year Ending December 31, Asset Fair Value at December 31, 2008 2009 2010 2007 (in thousands) Gas Hedge Derivatives (a): Average daily notional MMBtu volumes (b): Swap contracts (c) 129,167 9,897 2,500 $ 33,389 Weighted average fixed price per MMbtu $ 7.60 $ 7.85 $ 7.33 Average forward NYMEX gas prices (d) $ 9.18 $ 9.36 $ 9.17 (a) To minimize basis risk, the Company enters into basis swaps for a portion of its gas hedges to convert the index price of the hedging instrument from a NYMEX index to an index which reflects the geographic area of production. The Company considers these basis swaps as part of the associated swap and collar contracts and, accordingly, the effects of the basis swaps have been presented together with the associated contracts. (b) See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for hedge volumes and weighted average prices by calendar quarter. (c) Subsequent to December 31, 2007 and through February 15, 2008, the Company entered into additional swap contracts for approximately 69,945 MMBtu per day of the Companys 2008 production at an average price of $7.28 per MMBtu. (d) The average forward NYMEX gas prices are based on February 15, 2008 market quotes. 62 Gas Price Sensitivity Derivative Financial Instruments as of December 31, 2006 Year Ending December 31, Asset Fair Value at December 31, 2007 2008 2006 (in thousands) Gas Hedge Derivatives (a): Average daily notional MMBtu volumes: Swap contracts 86,194 15,000 $ 54,835 Weighted average fixed price per MMbtu $ 8.13 $ 8.62 Collar contracts 6,164 &mdash; $ 7,511 Weighted average ceiling price per MMbtu $ 11.52 $ &mdash; Weighted average floor price per MMbtu $ 9.00 $ &mdash; Average forward NYMEX gas prices (b) $ 7.99 $ 8.29 (a) To minimize basis risk, the Company enters into basis swaps for a portion of its gas hedges to convert the index price of the hedging instrument from a NYMEX index to an index which reflects the geographic area of production. The Company considers these basis swaps as part of the associated swap and collar contracts and, accordingly, the effects of the basis swaps have been presented together with the associated contracts. (b) The average forward NYMEX gas prices are based on February 19, 2007 market quotes. Qualitative Disclosures Non derivative financial instruments. The Company is a borrower under fixed rate and variable rate debt instruments that give rise to interest rate risk. The Companys objective in borrowing under fixed or variable rate debt is to satisfy capital requirements while minimizing the Companys costs of capital. See Note F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a discussion of the Companys debt instruments. Derivative financial instruments. The Company utilizes interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity price derivative contracts to hedge interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity price risks in accordance with policies and guidelines approved by the Board. In accordance with those policies and guidelines, the Companys executive management determines the appropriate timing and extent of hedge transactions. Foreign currency, operations and price risk. International investments represent, and are expected to continue to represent, a portion of the Companys total assets. Pioneer currently has international operations in Tunisia and South Africa, which together represented 11 percent of the Companys 2007 oil and gas revenues from continuing operations. Although Pioneers primary focus is directed toward onshore North American opportunities, Pioneer continues to identify and selectively evaluate other international opportunities. As a result of such foreign operations, Pioneers financial results and international operations could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in the legal or regulatory environment, weak economic conditions or changes in political or economic climates and other factors. For example: &bull; local political and economic developments could restrict or increase the cost of Pioneers foreign operations; &bull; exchange controls and currency fluctuations could result in financial losses; &bull; royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims could increase costs of Pioneers foreign operations; &bull; expropriation of the Companys property could result in loss of revenue, property and equipment; &bull; civil uprising, riots, terrorist attacks and wars could make it impractical to continue operations, resulting in financial losses; &bull; compliance with applicable U.S. law could be in conflict with the Companys contractual obligations, the laws of foreign governments or local customs; &bull; import and export regulations and other foreign laws or policies could result in loss of revenues; 63 &bull; repatriation levels for export revenues could restrict the availability of cash to fund operations outside a particular foreign country; and &bull; laws and policies of the U.S. affecting foreign trade, taxation and investment could restrict Pioneers ability to fund foreign operations or may make foreign operations more costly. Pioneer does not currently maintain political risk insurance. Pioneer evaluates on a country by country basis whether obtaining political risk coverage is necessary and may add such insurance in the future if the Company believes it is prudent to do so. Africa. The Companys producing assets in Africa are in South Africa and Tunisia. The Company views the operating environment in these African nations as stable and the economic stability as good. The Company also has an exploration permit in Equatorial Guinea. While the values of the various African nations currencies fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar, the Company believes that any currency risk associated with Pioneers African operations would not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations given that such operations are closely tied to oil prices, which are denominated in U.S. dollars. 64
