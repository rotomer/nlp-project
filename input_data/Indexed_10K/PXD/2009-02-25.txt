Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operations for additional discussions regarding proved reserves and their related cash flows. 21 Proved Reserves The Companys proved reserves totaled 959.6 MMBOE, 963.8 MMBOE and 904.9 MMBOE at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing $3.2 billion, $9.0 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively, of Standardized Measure. The Companys proved reserves include field fuel, which is gas consumed to operate field equipment (primarily compressors) prior to the gas being delivered to a sales point. The following table shows the changes in the Companys proved reserve volumes by geographic area during the year ended December 31, 2008 (in MBOE): Production Extensions and Discoveries Purchases of Minerals in Place Sales of Minerals in Place Revisions of Previous Estimates United States (40,764 ) 56,751 14,263 &mdash; (30,120 ) South Africa (1,505 ) &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; 894 Tunisia (2,405 ) 2,026 &mdash; (652 ) (2,679 ) Total (44,674 ) 58,777 14,263 (652 ) (31,905 ) Production. Production volumes include 3,129 MBOE of field fuel. Extensions and discoveries. Extensions and discoveries are primarily comprised of discoveries in the Companys South Texas Edwards Trend, Pierre Shale additions in southeastern Colorado and extension drilling in the North Texas Barnett Shale play. The Company also recorded discoveries in Tunisia during 2008. Purchases of minerals in place. Purchases of minerals in place are primarily attributable to acquisitions in the Companys Spraberry oil field, South Texas Edwards Trend and the North Texas Barnett Shale play. Sales of minerals in place. Sales of minerals in place are principally related to the Tunisian governments election to participate in 50 percent of the Companys discoveries in the Cherouq concession in the Jenein Nord permit. See Note N of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Revisions of previous estimates. Revisions of previous estimates are comprised of 69 MMBOE of negative price revisions offset by 37 MMBOE of positive technical revisions. The Companys proved reserves at December 31, 2008 were determined using year end NYMEX equivalent prices of $44.60 per barrel of oil and $5.71 per Mcf of gas, compared to $95.92 per barrel of oil and $6.80 per Mcf of gas at December 31, 2007. On a BOE basis, 58 percent of the Companys total proved reserves at December 31, 2008 were proved developed reserves. Based on reserve information as of December 31, 2008, and using the Companys production information for the year then ended, the reserve to production ratio associated with the Companys proved reserves was in excess of 21 years on a BOE basis. The following table provides information regarding the Companys proved reserves and average daily sales volumes by geographic area as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008: Proved Reserves as of December 31, 2008 2008 Average Daily Sales Volumes Oil & NGLs (MBbls) Gas (MMcf) (a) MBOE Standardized Measure Oil & NGLs (MBbls) Gas (MMcf) (b) BOE (in thousands) United States 448,892 2,917,031 935,063 $ 2,971,142 41,126 370,224 102,830 South Africa 471 38,624 6,909 64,861 2,405 10,232 4,110 Tunisia 13,587 24,104 17,604 151,384 6,178 2,367 6,573 Total 462,950 2,979,759 959,576 $ 3,187,387 49,709 382,823 113,513 (a) The gas reserves contain 360,340 MMcf of gas that will be produced and utilized as field fuel.

Description of Properties United States Approximately 88 percent of the Companys proved reserves at December 31, 2008 are located in the Spraberry field in the Permian Basin area, the Hugoton and West Panhandle fields in the Mid Continent area and the Raton field in the Rocky Mountains area. These fields generate substantial operating cash flow and the Spraberry and Raton fields have a large portfolio of low risk drilling opportunities. The cash flows generated from these fields provide funding for the Companys other development and exploration activities both domestically and internationally.

Permian Basin Spraberry field. The Spraberry field was discovered in 1949 and encompasses eight counties in West Texas. The field is approximately 150 miles long and 75 miles wide at its widest point. The oil produced is West Texas Intermediate Sweet, and the gas produced is casinghead gas with an average energy content of 1,400 Btu. The oil and gas are produced primarily from three formations, the upper and lower Spraberry and the Dean, at depths ranging from 6,700 feet to 9,200 feet. In addition, the Company continues to complete the majority of its wells in the Wolfcamp formation, at depths ranging from 9,300 feet to 10,300 feet, with successful results.The Company believes the Spraberry field offers excellent opportunities to grow oil and gas production because of the numerous undeveloped drilling locations, many of which are reflected in the Companys proved undeveloped reserves and the ability to contain operating expenses and drilling costs through economies of scale. During 2008, the Company initiated a program to test 20 acre infill drilling performance, as part of its announced recovery improvement initiatives. During 2008, the Company drilled and completed eleven 20 acre wells with encouraging results and an additional nine wells are in various stages of the completion and connection process. During the second half of 2008, in conjunction with its recovery improvement initiatives, the Company applied to the Railroad Commission of Texas to change the Spraberry Trend area field rules to permit drilling of optional 20 acre infill wells. The fieldwide rule changes were approved during January 2009. The Company has also identified waterflood, non traditional shale/silt interval and horizontal well initiative opportunities in the Spraberry field. The Companys Spraberry field waterflood project includes plans to convert select wells to water injection in 2009 and potentially drill additional injection wells in the second half of 2009, subject to improved commodity prices. Water injection into converted wells could commence as early as the second quarter 2009. The Company is continuing to test shale/silt non traditional intervals in ten wells that were completed in 2008. The 20 acre well spacing and other initiatives described above are being performed to increase the Spraberry field recovery percentage in those areas of the field that are expected to be conducive for these undertakings. However, the ultimate incremental recovery rates associated with these initiatives cannot be precisely predicted at this time. In 2008, the Company acquired approximately 13,000 gross acres in the Spraberry field for $11.0 million. The transaction included 23 producing wells, an incremental working interest increase in 112 wells already operated by Pioneer and a number of undeveloped drilling locations. Proved reserves associated with the acquisition were approximately 2.2 MMBOE. During 2008, the Company also (i) drilled 370 wells in the Spraberry field, an increase of six percent compared to 2007, (ii) acquired approximately 77,000 gross acres, bringing its total acreage position to approximately 920,000 gross acres (780,000 net acres), (iii) completed several property acquisitions and joint ventures and (iv) successfully drilled a majority of its Spraberry field wells to the Wolfcamp formation. The Companys 2009 drilling program has been curtailed until commodity prices increase and well costs decline. The 24 Company has reduced its operating rig count in the Spraberry field to one rig in mid February from a peak of 17 rigs during 2008. Midkiff Benedum Gas Processing System. The Company owns a 27 percent interest in the Spraberry Midkiff Benedum gas processing system (the System) in West Texas and, in July 2007, entered into an agreement with Atlas Pipeline Partners (Atlas) under which the Company obtained options to purchase an additional aggregate 22 percent interest in the System for $230 million, subject to normal closing adjustments. All or a portion of the options must be exercised by November 2, 2009. Any portion of the options not exercised by that date will lapse. Based on current commodity prices, the Company does not expect to exercise the options. Mid Continent Hugoton field. The Hugoton field in southwest Kansas is one of the largest producing gas fields in the continental United States. The gas is produced from the Chase and Council Grove formations at depths ranging from 2,700 feet to 3,000 feet. The Companys gas in the Hugoton field has an average energy content of 1,025 Btu. The Companys Hugoton properties are located on approximately 285,000 gross acres (247,000 net acres), covering approximately 400 square miles. The Company has working interests in approximately 1,200 wells in the Hugoton field, approximately 990 of which it operates, and partial royalty interests in approximately 500 wells. The Company owns substantially all of the gathering and processing facilities, primarily the Satanta plant, which service its production from the Hugoton field. This ownership allows the Company to control the production, gathering, processing and sale of its gas and NGL production. The Companys Hugoton operated wells are capable of producing approximately 65 MMcf of wet gas per day (i.e., gas production at the wellhead before processing or field fuel use and before reduction for royalties). Pioneer successfully led a cooperative effort with other operators in this field to effect rule changes which will enable further field development in future years. As part of the rule changes, the state regulated production allowables were canceled as of December 31, 2007, and the Company received regulatory approval to commingle production from the Panoma and Council Grove formations. A commingling program was initiated in 2008 with positive results and the Company is evaluating expanding this project further. To capitalize on these rule changes, future completion designs have been developed along with an optimization plan for the existing field compression system. West Panhandle field. The West Panhandle properties are located in the panhandle region of Texas. These stable, long lived reserves are attributable to the Red Cave, Brown Dolomite, Granite Wash and fractured Granite formations at depths no greater than 3,500 feet. The Companys gas in the West Panhandle field has an average energy content of 1,365 Btuand is produced from approximately 675 wells on more than 250,000 gross acres (240,000 net acres) covering over 375 square miles. The Company controls 100 percent of the wells, production equipment, gathering system and the Fain gas processing plant for the field. As this field is operated at or below vacuum conditions, Pioneer continually works to improve compressor and gathering system efficiency. Rocky Mountains The Raton Basin properties are located in the southeast portion of Colorado. Exploration for CBM in the Raton Basin began in the late 1970s and continued through the late 1980s, with several companies drilling and testing more than 100 wells during this period. The absence of a pipeline to transport gas from the Raton Basin prevented full scale development until January 1995, when Colorado Interstate Gas Company completed the construction of the Picketwire lateral pipeline system. Since the completion of the Picketwire lateral, production has continued to grow, resulting in expansion of the systems capacity by its operator, the most recent expansion of which was in 2005. The Company owns approximately 318,000 gross acres (231,000 net acres) in the center of the Raton Basin with current production from coal seams in the Vermejo and Raton formations. The Companys gas in the Raton Basin has an average energy content of 1,000 Btu. The Company owns the majority of the well servicing and frac equipment that it utilizes in the Raton field, allowing it to control costs and insure availability. In the Raton field, the Company sells its gas at a Mid Continent index price, which generally provides higher realized gas prices as compared to the Rockies based indexes. 25 The Companys Raton Basin production volumes increased 17 percent during the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2007. The production growth is principally attributable to production added from properties acquired by the Company in December 2007 and production added from the Companys ongoing development drilling program. During 2008, the Company announced a discovery in the Pierre Shale that lies beneath a portion of the Companys Raton Basin coal bed methane acreage. The Company remains encouraged by the drilling and testing results to date from three Pierre Shale zones, which are producing from vertical wells, and from two horizontal Pierre Shale wells. Initial results from the horizontal drilling indicate a high frequency of natural fracturing with differing production rates from the two wells tied to the occurrence of open fractures. During the twelve months of 2008, the Company drilled 146 wells in the Raton CBM field and 11 wells in the Pierre Shale, along with two water disposal wells. The Company is also enhancing its gathering and compression facilities in the area. To accommodate longer term production growth in the Raton Basin, the Company added firm pipeline capacity to transport 75 MMcfpd from the Raton Basin to the West Coast gas markets beginning in 2011. Onshore Gulf Coast In 2008, the South Texas drilling program focused on the Edwards Trend, a tight gas limestone reservoir extending over 250 miles in length and characterized by narrow bands of dry gas fields. The Company has acquired over 310,000 gross acres in the Edwards Trend. The Companys South Texas drilling program is focused in both established areas, such as the Pawnee field, and in growth areas along the trend, such as the new Moray field discovery. In addition to the Pawnee and Moray fields, the Company has operations in the S.W. Kenedy, Sawfish, Word, Three Rivers and Washburn fields. Productive depths in the Edwards Trend range from 9,500 feet to 14,500 feet. The Company drilled its first horizontal well in the Eagle Ford Shale play where it holds a substantial acreage position in the gas window. The Eagle Ford Shale play overlays the Edwards Trend in the 310,000 acres that the Company holds. Current plans are to fracture stimulate the well in late March or early April 2009. During 2008, the Company drilled 11 development wells and spud 25 exploration and extension wells. All 11 development wells were completed successfully. The exploration and extension wells were designed to identify new fields as well as further delineate previous discoveries. Of the 28 exploration and extension wells spud and evaluated, two are temporarily suspended awaiting the drilling of their lateral sections, one is awaiting completion, one was a dry hole and 24 were successfully completed and are currently producing. Three new fields were discovered during 2008. The acquisition of 3 D seismic data has significantly enhanced field development in all areas of the Edwards Trend, allowing the Company to more accurately locate and orient the horizontal wells for optimal results. Expanding its 3 D data coverage to include new discoveries and additional prospects, the Company has completed a program of shooting 900 square miles of new data. The acquisition of this data has been ongoing since 2007. In order to accommodate its growing Edwards Trend production, the Company significantly expanded its existing gas gathering and processing infrastructure during 2008. The expansion included constructing over 28 miles of gathering system pipeline, building three additional operated gas treatment plants and connecting to two additional non operated gas treatment plants. Barnett Shale During 2008, the Company participated in the drilling of 19 successful exploration and development wells in the Barnett Shale play in Wise and Parker counties, Texas on both operated and non operated properties. Another two wells were drilled, but were not completed at the end of 2008. In addition, two non producing wells were acquired, successfully fracture stimulated and placed on production. During 2008, the Company enhanced its Barnett Shale acreage position through leasing and acquisitions, acquired approximately 250 square miles of 3 D seismic data and improved its operations through compression optimization projects. The Companys total holdings in the Barnett Shale play now approximate 70,000 gross acres with more than 500 potential drilling locations, most of which is covered by 3 D seismic data. Alaska Oooguruk. In 2002, the Company acquired a 70 percent working interest and operatorship in ten state leases on Alaskas North Slope, and in 2003 drilled three exploratory wells to test a possible extension of the productive 26 sands in the Kuparuk River field in the shallow waters offshore the North Slope of Alaska. Although all three of the wells found the sands filled with oil, they were too thin to be considered commercial on a stand alone basis. However, the wells also encountered thick sections of oil bearing Jurassic aged sands, and the first well flowed at a rate of approximately 1,300 Bbls per day. In January 2004, the Company farmed into a large acreage block to the southwest of the Companys discovery. In 2004, Pioneer completed an extensive technical and economic evaluation of the resource potential within this area. As a result of this evaluation, the Company performed front end engineering and permitting activities during 2005 to further define the scope of the project. In early 2006, the Company announced that it had approved the development of the Oooguruk field in the project area. The Company constructed and armored a gravel drilling and production island site in 2006. Installation of a subsea flowline and production facilities to carry produced liquids to existing onshore processing facilities at the Kuparuk River Unit was completed in 2007. Pioneer assembled the drilling rig on location and commenced drilling the first of an estimated 33 horizontal development and injector wells in December of 2007. During 2008, the Company completed two producing wells, one injection well and one disposal well. The Company commenced production from the Oooguruk development project during the second quarter of 2008. In mid July 2008, production was shut in for scheduled maintenance at third party onshore production facilities. Following the completion of the maintenance work in late September 2008, production resumed. Net production from the project averaged 3,469 barrels during the fourth quarter of 2008 and initial production from the most recent well completed was approximately 7,000 gross Bbls of oil per day. During 2009, development drilling on the Oooguruk project will continue and the Company expects to drill and complete approximately three injection wells and four planned producing wells. Cosmopolitan. In 2005, the Company acquired an interest in the Cosmopolitan Unit in the Cook Inlet of Alaska. Through a series of transactions, the Company now owns 100 percent of the Cosmopolitan Unit. The previous operator of the Cosmopolitan Unit had an oil discovery for which economic viability was not determined. During 2005 and 2006, the Company completed and interpreted a 3 D seismic shoot. During 2007, the Company drilled the Hansen #1A L1 well, a lateral sidetrack from an existing wellbore, to appraise the resource potential of the unit. The initial unstimulated production test results were encouraging and additional permitting and facilities planning ensued during 2008 to further evaluate the units resource potential. During 2009, the Company will continue to evaluate the Hansen #1A L1, carry forward with permitting, progress engineering studies and develop plans for a second well to be drilled in 2010 to further delineate the extent of the units resource potential. International The Companys international operations are located offshore South Africa and onshore in southern Tunisia. The following table summarizes the Companys international exploration/extension drilling activities during 2008: Exploration/Extension Drilling Beginning Wells In Progress Wells Spud Successful Wells Unsuccessful Wells Ending Wells In Progress Tunisia 1 12 6 2 5 The following table summarizes the Companys international costs incurred by geographic area during 2008: Asset Exploration Development Retirement Costs Costs Obligations Total (in thousands) South Africa $ 145 $ 4,826 $ 2,235 $ 7,206 Tunisia 103,732 28,061 1,452 133,245 Total International $ 103,877 $ 32,887 $ 3,687 $ 140,451 South Africa. The Company has agreements to explore for oil and gas covering over 3.6 million acres offshore the southern coast of South Africa in water depths generally less than 650 feet. 27 The Sable oil field began producing in August 2003 and was shut in at the end of the third quarter of 2008. Over its five year life, the Sable oil field performed better than expected, recovering approximately 23.6 million gross barrels of oil. During the life of the Sable oil field, the majority of the gas produced in conjunction with the oil production was reinjected back into the reservoir. The Company had a 40 percent working interest in the oil production from the Sable field. In 2005, the Company sanctioned the non operated South Coast Gas development project, which includes the subsea tie back of gas from the Sable field and five additional gas accumulations to an existing production facility on the F A platform for transportation via existing pipelines to a gas to liquids plant. Pioneer has a 45 percent working interest in the project. As part of sanctioning of the South Coast Gas project, the Company signed a six year contract for the sale of its gas and condensate production from the project. The contract contains an obligation for the purchaser to take or pay for a total of 91.4 BCF and associated condensate if the anticipated deliverability estimates are achieved. The price for both gas and condensate is indexed to Brent oil prices. First production from the South Coast Gas project was achieved in the third quarter of 2007. A significant portion of the gas reserves associated with the South Coast Gas project are in the Sable field. In the third quarter of 2008, Sable oil production was shut in and operations to convert Sables gas injection well to a producing well commenced. Gas sales from the Sable gas well were initiated in mid October 2008 and the other wells resumed production in late October. The Sable gas well is expected to be the most productive well in the South Coast Gas project. Tunisia. The Company holds interests in four separate onshore permits located in the southern portion of Tunisia. These permits cover a gross area of approximately 12,740 square kilometers containing two production concessions targeting the Acacus formation with additional future upside exploration potential from this and other formations. &bull; Jenein Nord Permit and Cherouq Concession. The Jenein Nord Permit covered approximately 1,240 square kilometers. Over the past three years, the Company has conducted an exploration program over the area. As a result of a seismic data acquisition and exploration drilling program, the Company achieved a significant number of hydrocarbon discoveries. Based on the success, the Company, along with the government oil agency, Enterprise Tunisienne dActivities Petrolieres ("ETAP"), submitted a joint application on November 10, 2007 to the Directeur G&eacute;n&eacute;ral de lEnergie for the development of a portion of the permit area called the Cherouq Concession. On December 17, 2007, the Consultative Committee of Hydrocarbons, the advisory committee to the Directeur G&eacute;n&eacute;ral de lEnergie, approved the Cherouq Concession resulting in the Company and ETAP each holding a 50 percent working interest in the concession. The concession covers approximately 760 square kilometers of the Jenein Nord Permit. Since the second half of 2006, the Company drilled fourteen wells in the concession and first production from the concession was achieved in late 2007. During 2008, gross production from the Cherouq Concession was approximately 2.5 million barrels. The Company plans to complete the processing of 295 square kilometers of 3 D seismic data that was acquired during 2008 over the Cherouq Concession. &bull; Borj El Khadra Permit and Adam Concession. The Borj El Khadra Permit, including the Adam Concession, covers approximately 3,725 square kilometers. Production from the Adam Concession began in May 2003, for which the Company now has a 20 percent working interest. During 2008, the Company continued its exploratory and appraisal activities on the Adam Concession by drilling four successful wells and began drilling two wells in the Borj El Khadra Permit, of which one was successful and one was in progress at year end, but subsequent to year end, was determined to be uneconomical.. The Company plans to drill up to four additional wells in the Adam Concession and Borj El Khadra Permit during 2009. &bull; El Hamra Permit. The El Hamra exploration permit covers approximately 4,000 square kilometers, of which the Company is operator with a 50 percent working interest during the exploration period. In 2008, the Company completed processing of 310 kilometers of seismic data and drilled one unsuccessful exploration well. The Company plans on further interpretation of the seismic data during 2009. &bull; Anaguid Permit. The Anaguid exploration permit covers approximately 3,800 square kilometers. In 2007, the Company acquired an additional 15 percent interest in the Anaguid exploration permit, thereby increasing its interest to 60 percent (during the exploration period) and resulting in the transfer of 28 operations to Pioneer. During 2008, the Company acquired an additional 900 square kilometers of 3 D seismic data and drilled one successful exploration well. The Company plans to complete the processing and interpretation of the seismic data and rill an additional exploration well during 2010. Selected Oil and Gas Information The following tables set forth selected oil and gas information from continuing operations for the Company as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial and Operating Performance Pioneers financial and operating performance for 2008 included the following highlights: &bull; Net income decreased 41 percent to $220.1 million ($1.85 per diluted share) in 2008 from $372.7 million ($3.06 per diluted share) in 2007, primarily due to Uinta/Piceance and Mississippi asset impairment charges recorded during 2008, an increase in effective income tax rates during 2008 and net income in 2007 including a $101.3 million gain on the sale of Canada and income from discontinued operations in Canada. &bull; Income from continuing operations decreased to $220.8 million ($1.86 per diluted share) for 2008, as compared to $242.0 million ($1.99 per diluted share) for 2007, primarily due to the aforementioned impairment charges and a higher effective income tax rate &bull; Average daily sales volumes, on a BOE basis, increased 17 percent in 2008 as compared to 2007, primarily due to successful drilling programs, core area acquisitions and a 12 percent decrease in the delivery of VPP volumes. &bull; Oil and gas revenues increased $536.5 million, or 31 percent in 2008, as compared to 2007, due to a combination of increased production and increases in commodity prices. The benefit of this increase was partially offset by a $174.5 million increase in production costs compared to 2007, principally as a result of higher energy related costs and service cost inflation. &bull; Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $249.9 million, or 32 percent as compared to 2007, primarily due to increased sales volumes and increased commodity prices. &bull; The Companys Alaskan Oooguruk project began first production and sales during 2008. &bull; The Company received approval for optional 20 acre downspacing fieldwide in the Spraberry field, significantly increasing development opportunities in the field. &bull; Pioneer Southwest completed its initial public offering of 9,487,500 common units representing limited partner interests, with the Company realizing total net proceeds of $166.0 million. &bull; The Company purchased 4.4 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $165.2 million under the Companys share repurchase program. &bull; The Company initiated cost reduction initiatives in response to significant commodity price declines experienced during the third and fourth quarters of 2008. Significant Events Financial markets. During the second half of 2008, worldwide financial markets experienced significant turmoil as concerns regarding a worldwide economic slowdown increased and the availability of liquidity provided by the financial markets declined. These concerns have continued into the first quarter of 2009. In response to these circumstances, governments worldwide have taken steps to enhance confidence in and support for the financial markets and have announced economic stimulus programs. The success of these actions and the duration of the uncertainty in financial markets cannot be predicted. The Company is closely monitoring the economic environment, including whether and to what extent sustained lower commodity prices could impact its short term liquidity. Longer term, depending on the severity and duration of the worldwide economic decline, these market conditions could negatively impact the Companys liquidity, financial position and future results of operations. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had $48.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and $3.0 billion in outstanding long term debt, with $541.0 million of liquidity under its senior unsecured credit facility that matures in 2012. The amount of liquidity under the credit facility is subject to a covenant requiring that the Company maintain a specified ratio of the net present value of the Companys oil and gas properties to total debt, with the variables on which the calculation of net present value is based (including assumed commodity prices and discount rates) being subject to adjustment by the lenders. Therefore, the amount that the Company may borrow under the credit facility in the future could be reduced as a result of lower oil, NGL or gas prices, among other items. As of December 31, 2008, the Company was also a party to derivative financial instruments, of which $132.2 million represent net assets. Management is closely monitoring the credit standings of its counterparties, including its banks, derivative counterparties and purchasers of the commodities the Company produces and sells. Commodity prices. The reduced liquidity provided by the worldwide financial markets and other factors have resulted in an economic slowdown in the United States and other industrialized countries which has further resulted in significant reductions in worldwide energy demand. At the same time, North American gas supply has increased as a result of the rise in domestic unconventional gas production during 2008 and prior years. The combination of lower demand due to the economic slowdown and higher North American gas supply has 40 resulted in significant declines in oil, NGL and gas prices from their highs earlier in 2008. These circumstances have led to a dramatic decrease in drilling activity in the industry and has reduced the demand for drilling rigs and vessels, oilfield supplies, drill pipe and utilities, which had reached very high levels in terms of utilization and cost in mid 2008. Although these costs have begun to decline, their declines significantly lag behind the declines in oil, NGL and gas prices. As a result of these circumstances, the Company experienced significant operating margin deterioration during the second half of 2008 and recognized negative price revisions to proved reserves at the end of 2008 due to lower commodity prices and still relatively high capital and operating costs. The duration and magnitude of the commodity price declines cannot be predicted. Low price environment initiatives. As a result of the significant drop in commodity prices, the Company has implemented initiatives to reduce capital spending, operating costs and general and administrative expenses to support its goal of delivering free cash flow in 2009 and to enhance financial flexibility. This plan includes minimizing drilling activities until margins improve as a result of (i) increased commodity prices, (ii) reduced gas price differentials relative to NYMEX quoted prices in the areas where the Company produces gas and or (iii) decreased well costs. During 2009, the Company is undertaking further efforts to reduce its capital, production and administrative costs. Pioneer has reduced its operated rig activity from 29 rigs in the third quarter of 2008 to two rigs drilling in mid February 2009. The Company is continuing to work with drilling and service providers to reduce drilling and completion costs. To date, Pioneer has achieved reductions of 15 percent to 20 percent in drilling and completion costs and is targeting an additional 10 percent to 20 percent reduction. Rigs have been terminated or stacked in the Spraberry, Raton, Edwards Trend and Barnett Shale areas. The Companys asset teams are also implementing initiatives to reduce controllable production costs, including costs associated with fuel surcharges, electricity supply, water disposal and compression rental. In 2009, the Company expects capital spending to total $250 million to $300 million (excluding acquisitions, effects of asset retirement obligations, capitalized interest and geological and geophysical administrative costs). Approximately 75 percent of this amount is for drilling, primarily in Alaska and the Spraberry field. The remaining 25 percent will be used for facility expansions and acreage extensions to Pioneers core assets. Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. During the first two weeks of September 2008, Hurricanes Gustav and Ike struck the Louisiana and Texas gulf coasts. The following areas of Texas and Louisiana were adversely impacted: Spraberry. The Companys Spraberry facilities in West Texas were not directly impacted by either hurricane. The Spraberry field produces oil and associated liquid rich gas. The gas includes NGLs which are separated at various Permian Basin plants. These NGLs are then transported to a third party facility in Mont Belvieu, Texas for fractionation. This facility sustained power interruptions and physical damage from Hurricane Ike, disrupting its ability to receive the Companys NGLs. As a result, a portion of the Companys Spraberry and other Permian Basin area production was shut in or curtailed from early September to mid November while repairs and maintenance to the facility were being completed. Fort Worth Barnett Shale. The Companys Barnett Shale facilities were not directly impacted by the recent hurricanes. However, as in the Spraberry field, the Companys Barnett Shale gas includes NGLs that are processed at the Mont Belvieu fractionation facilities. The Company experienced only a temporary shut in of its Barnett Shale production, and production was fully resumed by the end of September. South Texas Edwards Trend. No significant hurricane damage occurred at the Companys facilities in the Edwards Trend area of South Texas. However, power interruptions to third party pipelines that transport gas production from the field resulted in the temporary curtailment of portions of the Companys total Edwards Trend net production. Gulf of Mexico Shelf. The Companys shallow water offshore platforms did not experience any significant damage as a result of the hurricanes. However, production of approximately 1,800 BOEPD was shut in from August 31 to mid November due to the significant damage that was incurred by the third party pipeline facilities utilized to transport production to shore. SemGroup receivables. The Company is a creditor in the bankruptcy of SemGroup, L.P. and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, SemGroup), which filed petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on July 22, 2008 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. SemGroup purchased condensate from the Company and, at the time of the bankruptcy filings, was indebted to the Company for $29.6 million. The Company believes that it is probable that the collection of the pre petition claims will not occur for a 41 protracted period of time and that some of its claims may be uncollectible. Consequently, the Company recorded a bad debt expense of $19.6 million during the second half of 2008, which reduced the carrying value of the claims to $10.0 million. SemGroups reorganization effort is still in its early stages and determination of the exact amount of uncollectible claims is not presently determinable. It is reasonably possible that the Company will not collect the claims or that collected amounts will be less than $10.0 million. If those circumstances occur, the Company would recognize additional bad debt expense to further reduce the carrying value of its claims. The Company believes that any losses relating to its failure to collect its SemGroup claims would not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position as a whole or on its liquidity, capital resources or future annual results of operations. See Note I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1. Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Companys SemGroup bankruptcy claims. First Quarter 2009 Outlook Based on current estimates, the Company expects that first quarter 2009 production will average 117,000 to 122,000 BOEPD. The range reflects the typical variability in the timing of oil cargo shipments in Tunisia. First quarter production costs (including production and ad valorem taxes and transportation costs) are expected to average $13.50 to $14.50 per BOE based on NYMEX strip prices for oil, NGLs and gas at the time of the estimate. Depletion, depreciation and amortization (DD&A) expense is expected to average $13.25 to $14.25 per BOE. Total exploration and abandonment expense for the quarter is expected to be $20 million to $30 million, primarily related to exploration drilling in Tunisia, acreage expirations, and seismic and personnel costs. General and administrative expense is expected to be $32 million to $36 million. Interest expense is expected to be $38 million to $41 million. Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations is expected to be $2 million to $4 million. Minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries net income is expected to be $5 million to $8 million, primarily reflecting the public ownership in Pioneer Southwest. The Company also expects to recognize $25 million to $30 million of charges in other expense associated with certain drilling rigs being terminated and stacked as a result of the Companys low price environment initiatives. The Companys first quarter effective income tax rate is expected to range from 40 percent to 50 percent based on current capital spending plans and higher tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions. Cash income taxes are expected to range from $5 million to $10 million, principally related to Tunisian income taxes. Acquisitions 2008 acquisition expenditures. During 2008, the Company spent approximately $135.4 million to acquire proved and unproved properties. The acquisitions primarily added proved reserves and increased the Companys acreage positions in the Spraberry field, Edwards Trend and Barnett Shale play. 2007 acquisition expenditures. During 2007, the Company spent approximately $536.7 million to acquire proved and unproved properties. The acquisitions primarily added proved reserves and increased the Companys acreage positions in the Spraberry field, Raton field and Barnett Shale play. 2006 acquisition expenditures. During 2006, the Company spent approximately $223.2 million to acquire proved and unproved properties, which was comprised of approximately $144.8 million of proved properties and $78.3 million of unproved properties. The proved properties acquired primarily comprise acquisitions in the Spraberry field and Edwards Trend area. In North America, the acquisition of unproved properties was comprised of acreage acquisitions in the Spraberry field, Edwards Trend area, Rockies area, Alaska and Canada. The Company also acquired an additional interest in its Jenein Nord block in Tunisia and recognized additional obligations associated with its Nigerian prospects during 2006. 42 Divestitures Canada. In November 2007, the Company sold its Canadian subsidiaries for $525.7 million, resulting in a gain of $101.3 million. The historic results of these assets and the related gain on disposition are reported as discontinued operations. Argentina and Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. During March 2006, the Company sold its interests in certain oil and gas properties in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for net proceeds of $1.2 billion, resulting in a gain of $725.3 million. During April 2006, the Company sold its Argentine assets for net proceeds of $669.6 million, resulting in a gain of $10.9 million. The historic results of these properties and the related gains on disposition are reported as discontinued operations. Results of Operations Oil and gas revenues. Oil and gas revenues totaled $2.3 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The revenue increase during 2008, as compared to 2007, was primarily reflective of increases in United States, South Africa and Tunisia revenues. The increase in United States revenues was primarily due to an increase in average daily sales volumes resulting from successful drilling programs, core area acquisitions and reductions in scheduled VPP deliveries, combined with a 23 percent increase in reported NGL prices and six percent increases in both reported oil and gas prices. The increase in Tunisian revenues resulted from an increase in average daily sales volumes from successful drilling efforts, a 37 percent increase in reported gas prices and a 29 percent increase in reported oil prices. South African revenues increased due to an increase in average daily sales volumes realized from a full year of sales from the portion of the wells in the South Coast Gas project that commenced gas production during the fourth quarter of 2007, and a 44 percent increase in reported oil prices, partially offset by a 14 percent decrease in reported gas prices. The revenue increase during 2007, as compared to 2006, was primarily reflective of increases in United States and Tunisian revenues, partially offset by decreases in South African revenues. The increase in United States revenues was primarily due to an increase in average daily sales volumes resulting from successful drilling programs and reductions in scheduled VPP deliveries, combined with an 18 percent increase in reported NGL prices and an 18 percent increase in reported gas prices. The increase in Tunisian revenues resulted from an increase in average daily sales volumes from successful drilling efforts and a 12 percent increase in average reported prices. South African revenues declined due to normal production decline rates in the Sable oil field and the timing of oil cargo liftings, partially offset by increases in average reported oil prices and initial gas production in 2007 from the South Coast Gas project. 43 The following table provides average daily sales volumes from continuing operations by geographic area and in total, for 2008, 2007 and 2006: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Oil (Bbls): United States 22,044 18,643 17,716 South Africa 2,405 2,681 4,127 Tunisia 6,178 3,845 2,386 Worldwide 30,627 25,169 24,229 NGLs (Bbls): United States 19,082 18,553 18,488 Gas (Mcf): United States 370,224 316,418 284,732 South Africa 10,232 2,840 &mdash; Tunisia 2,367 2,513 1,195 Worldwide 382,823 321,771 285,927 Total (BOE): United States 102,830 89,933 83,659 South Africa 4,110 3,154 4,127 Tunisia 6,573 4,264 2,585 Worldwide 113,513 97,351 90,371 On a BOE basis, average daily production for 2008, as compared to 2007, increased by 14 percent in the United States, 30 percent in South Africa and 54 percent in Tunisia. Average daily BOE production for 2007, as compared to 2006, increased by seven percent in the United States and by 65 percent in Tunisia, while average daily production decreased by 24 percent in South Africa. During the year ended December 31, 2008, oil and gas volumes delivered under the Companys VPPs decreased by 12 percent, as compared to 2007. The following table provides average daily sales volumes from discontinued operations by geographic area and in total during 2008, 2007 and 2006: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Oil (Bbls): United States &mdash; &mdash; 2,400 Argentina &mdash; &mdash; 2,515 Canada &mdash; 267 311 Worldwide &mdash; 267 5,226 NGLs (Bbls): United States &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; Argentina &mdash; &mdash; 421 Canada &mdash; 371 463 Worldwide &mdash; 371 884 Gas (Mcf): United States &mdash; &mdash; 36,038 Argentina &mdash; &mdash; 43,905 Canada &mdash; 44,645 43,434 Worldwide &mdash; 44,645 123,377 Total (BOE): United States &mdash; &mdash; 8,406 Argentina &mdash; &mdash; 10,253 Canada &mdash; 8,080 8,013 Worldwide &mdash; 8,080 26,672 44 The following table provides average reported prices from continuing operations, including the results of hedging activities and the amortization of VPP deferred revenue, and average realized prices from continuing operations, excluding the results of hedging activities and the amortization of VPP deferred revenue, by geographic area and in total, for 2008, 2007 and 2006: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Average reported prices: Oil (per Bbl): United States $ 67.43 $ 63.78 $ 65.73 South Africa $ 110.21 $ 76.36 $ 65.92 Tunisia $ 90.64 $ 70.04 $ 63.16 Worldwide $ 75.47 $ 66.08 $ 65.51 NGL (per Bbl): United States $ 51.34 $ 41.60 $ 35.24 Gas (per Mcf): United States $ 7.68 $ 7.25 $ 6.15 South Africa $ 5.83 $ 6.76 $ &mdash; Tunisia $ 12.04 $ 8.77 $ 5.97 Worldwide $ 7.66 $ 7.26 $ 6.15 Total (per BOE): United States $ 51.63 $ 47.30 $ 42.64 South Africa $ 79.00 $ 70.98 $ 65.92 Tunisia $ 89.53 $ 68.33 $ 61.05 Worldwide $ 54.82 $ 48.99 $ 44.23 Average realized prices: Oil (per Bbl): United States $ 96.21 $ 70.26 $ 62.92 South Africa $ 110.21 $ 76.72 $ 65.74 Tunisia $ 90.64 $ 70.04 $ 63.16 Worldwide $ 96.19 $ 70.91 $ 63.42 NGL (per Bbl): United States $ 51.59 $ 41.60 $ 35.24 Gas (per Mcf): United States $ 7.41 $ 6.02 $ 5.96 South Africa $ 5.83 $ 6.76 $ &mdash; Tunisia $ 12.04 $ 8.77 $ 5.97 Worldwide $ 7.40 $ 6.04 $ 5.96 Total (per BOE): United States $ 56.88 $ 44.31 $ 41.37 South Africa $ 79.00 $ 71.29 $ 65.74 Tunisia $ 89.53 $ 68.33 $ 61.05 Worldwide $ 59.57 $ 46.24 $ 43.04 Derivative activities. The Company, from time to time, utilizes commodity swap and collar contracts in order to (i) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities the Company produces and sells, (ii) support the Companys annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and (iii) reduce commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Companys commodity price hedges decreased oil and gas revenues from continuing operations by $355.6 million, $83.5 million and $151.2 million, respectively. The effective portions of changes in the fair values of the Companys commodity price hedges are deferred as increases or decreases to stockholders equity until the underlying hedged transaction occurs. Consequently, changes in the effective portions of commodity price hedges add volatility to the Companys reported stockholders equity until the hedge derivative matures or is terminated. During December 2008, the Company began entering into commodity derivative contracts that were not designated as hedges under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The changes in the fair value of these instruments are being recognized as gains or losses in the earnings of the period in which they occur. During 2008, the Companys non hedge derivative contracts increased other expense by $10.6 million. Effective February 1, 2009, the Company discontinued hedge accounting on all existing commodity derivative instruments, and from that date 45 forward will account for derivative instruments using the mark to market accounting method. Therefore, the Company will recognize all future changes in the fair values of its derivative contracts as gains or losses in the earnings of the period in which they occur. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for information concerning the impact to oil and gas revenues during 2008, 2007 and 2006 from the Companys hedging activities, the Companys open and terminated derivative positions at December 31, 2008 and descriptions of the Companys commodity derivatives. Also see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional disclosures about the Companys commodity related derivative financial instruments. Deferred revenue. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Companys recognition of previously deferred VPP revenue increased oil and gas revenues from continuing operations by $158.1 million, $181.2 million and $190.3 million, respectively. The Companys amortization of deferred VPP revenue is scheduled to increase 2009 oil and gas revenues by $147.9 million. See Note T of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for specific information regarding the Companys VPPs. Interest and other income. The Companys interest and other income totaled $61.3 million, $91.9 million and $43.5 million during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The $30.5 million decrease during 2008, as compared to 2007, is primarily attributable to (i) a $56.2 million decrease in Alaskan Petroleum Production Tax (PPT) credit dispositions, partially offset by (ii) a $23.2 million gain on bond repurchases. The $48.4 million increase during 2007, as compared to 2006, is primarily attributable to (i) $74.9 million of 2007 Alaskan PPT credit dispositions offset by (ii) an $11.3 million decrease in interest income, (iii) a $7.6 million reduction in business interruption insurance claims and (iv) a $7.4 million decrease in derivative ineffectiveness income. In 2006, Alaska replaced its severance tax with the PPT for periods beginning after March 31, 2006. In late 2007, Alaska made further changes to the PPT through legislation referred to as Alaskas Clear and Equitable Share (ACES). The ACES modifications to PPT were effective as of July 1, 2007. Due to the Companys expenditures in Alaska before beginning production, the Company generated PPT related carryforwards. At December 31, 2008, the Company had approximately $89.0 million of available PPT related carryforwards that may be monetized in the future. The Company anticipates recognizing further benefits from the PPT related carryforwards from (i) a reduction in PPT liabilities or (ii) sales of the carryforwards to third parties, if transferable, or reimbursement from the State of Alaska. The Company anticipates that any transfers of PPT related carryforwards to third parties would be at a discounted value, for which the amount of discount is currently not known, but is not expected to be significant. Gain (loss) on disposition of assets. The Company recorded a net loss on disposition of assets of $381 thousand in 2008, as compared to net losses of $2.2 million and $6.5 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. During 2007, the Company recognized a gain on the sale of its Canadian assets of $101.3 million. During 2006, the Company recognized gains on the sale of its interest in certain oil and gas properties in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and its Argentina assets of approximately $736.2 million. However, pursuant to SFAS 144, these gains and the results of operations from the assets are presented as discontinued operations. The net cash proceeds from asset divestitures during 2008, 2007 and 2006 were used, together with net cash flows provided by operating activities, to fund additions to oil and gas properties and stock repurchase programs, and to reduce outstanding indebtedness. See Notes N and V of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding asset divestitures. Oil and gas production costs. The Companys oil and gas production costs totaled $595.2 million, $420.7 million and $349.1 million during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In general, lease operating expenses and workover expenses represent the components of oil and gas production costs over which the Company has management control, while production taxes and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes. Third party transportation charges represent costs incurred directly from interstate carriers associated with the delivery of oil and gas products from the lease to a downstream point of sale and are based on volumes delivered. Total production costs per BOE increased during 2008 by 21 percent as compared to 2007 primarily due to increases in production taxes due to commodity price increases and increases in lease operating expense. The increase in lease operating expenses is primarily due to (i) fixed production costs associated with first sales from the Alaskan Oooguruk development project, (ii) fixed production costs associated with the Companys South African Sable oil field production, prior to its shut in in September 2008, (iii) production operations in the Tunisian Cherouq 46 concession, (iv) unscheduled compressor repairs and maintenance in the Raton field and (v) general inflation of field service costs and electricity charges. Total production costs per BOE increased during 2007 by 12 percent as compared to 2006 primarily due to (i) general inflation of field service and supply costs associated with rising commodity prices, (ii) increased repair and clean up costs, and associated production downtime, from severe weather conditions that affected certain areas of the Companys United States operations during the first quarter of 2007, (iii) increased workover activity and (iv) fixed production costs associated with declining South African Sable oil production. The following tables provide the components of the Companys total production costs per BOE and total production costs per BOE by geographic area for 2008, 2007 and 2006: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Lease operating expenses $ 8.37 $ 6.75 $ 6.13 Third party transportation charges 1.06 0.97 0.79 Net natural gas plant/gathering 0.11 0.16 (0.19 ) Taxes: Ad valorem 1.41 1.23 1.35 Production 2.55 1.96 1.84 Workover costs 0.83 0.77 0.66 Total production costs $ 14.33 $ 11.84 $ 10.58 Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 United States $ 14.24 $ 11.79 $ 10.61 South Africa $ 25.98 $ 22.43 $ 14.47 Tunisia $ 8.19 $ 5.14 $ 3.41 Worldwide $ 14.33 $ 11.84 $ 10.58 Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense. The Companys total DD&A expense was $12.32, $10.90 and $9.52 per BOE for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Depletion expense, the largest component of DD&A expense, was $11.62, $10.10 and $8.80 per BOE during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. During 2008, the increase in per BOE depletion expense was primarily due to (i) losing end of well life reserves that became uneconomic as a result of lower 2008 year end commodity prices, (ii) a generally increasing trend in the Companys oil and gas properties cost bases per BOE of total proved and proved developed reserves as a result of cost inflation in drilling rig rates and drilling supplies and (iii) the relatively higher depletion rate per BOE associated with production from the Oooguruk development and South African South Coast Gas projects. During 2007, the increase in per BOE depletion expense was primarily due to (i) a generally increasing trend in the Companys oil and gas properties cost bases per BOE of total proved and proved developed reserves as a result of cost inflation in drilling rig rates and drilling supplies and (ii) first production of the South Coast Gas project in South Africa, which has a higher depletion rate. The following table provides depletion expense per BOE from continuing operations by geographic area for 2008, 2007 and 2006: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 United States $ 11.72 $ 10.27 $ 9.07 South Africa $ 18.37 $ 12.07 $ 6.28 Tunisia $ 5.96 $ 5.01 $ 4.25 Worldwide $ 11.62 $ 10.10 $ 8.80 47 Impairment of oil and gas properties and other assets. The Company reviews its long lived assets to be held and used, including oil and gas properties, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recognized impairment charges of $104.3 million to reduce the carrying value of the Companys net assets in the Uinta/Piceance and Mississippi areas. The declines in gas prices during the second half of 2008 led to the impairment charge. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company recognized aggregate noncash impairment charges of $26.2 million. During 2007, the Company recorded a charge of $10.3 million to write off the Companys remaining basis in Block H in Equatorial Guinea. The charge was recorded in connection with an arbitration that was active among the parties participating in the Block H prospect. Another $10.2 million of the impairment charges related to the Companys announcement of its intent to dispose of its Nigerian subsidiary that held an interest in Block 320 and the resulting adjustment to reduce its cost basis to Block 320s estimated fair value. During the second quarter of 2007, the Company also recognized a $5.7 million impairment charge to reduce the carrying values of certain oil and gas properties located in Louisiana due to poor well performance. The commodity price declines in the second half of 2008 also provided indications that the Companys $310.6 million carrying value of goodwill and $237.2 million carrying value of the South African South Coast Gas project may have been impaired as of December 31, 2008. After performing impairment evaluations, the Company determined that its goodwill and South African South Coast Gas project were not impaired as of December 31, 2008. However, continuation of commodity price declines during the first quarter of 2009 indicates that these assets may be at risk for future impairment and that the Uinta/Piceance assets may be at risk for further impairment. See Note S of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding these impairment risks and factors that affect the determination of impairment charges. Exploration, abandonments, geological and geophysical costs. The following table provides the Companys geological and geophysical costs, exploratory dry hole expense, leasehold abandonments and other exploration expense by geographic area for 2008, 2007 and 2006: United States South Africa Tunisia Other Total (in thousands) Year ended December 31, 2008 Geological and geophysical $ 79,117 $ 143 $ 22,499 $ &mdash; $ 101,759 Exploratory dry holes 73,742 &mdash; 15,130 &mdash; 88,872 Leasehold abandonments and other 44,899 &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; 44,899 $ 197,758 $ 143 $ 37,629 $ &mdash; $ 235,530 Year ended December 31, 2007 Geological and geophysical $ 91,547 $ 276 $ 2,812 $ 9,182 $ 103,817 Exploratory dry holes 119,638 &mdash; 13,931 13,851 147,420 Leasehold abandonments and other 20,453 &mdash; &mdash; 7,639 28,092 $ 231,638 $ 276 $ 16,743 $ 30,672 $ 279,329 Year ended December 31, 2006 Geological and geophysical $ 79,140 $ 289 $ 8,402 $ 21,536 $ 109,367 Exploratory dry holes 80,023 7,227 6,214 15,845 109,309 Leasehold abandonments and other 13,696 &mdash; &mdash; 17,824 31,520 $ 172,859 $ 7,516 $ 14,616 $ 55,205 $ 250,196 During 2008, the Companys geological and geophysical expense, exploratory dry hole provisions and leasehold abandonments expense is primarily attributable to seismic activity in the Companys Mississippi, South Texas and Tunisia areas, dry hole expense and unproved property abandonments. The significant components of the Companys exploratory dry hole provisions and leasehold abandonments expense included (i) $47.1 million of costs associated with the unsuccessful Lay Creek CBM pilot project, (ii) $12.2 million of costs associated with the unsuccessful Delaware Basin exploration project, (iii) $11.3 million of costs associated with the unsuccessful Sligo exploration well in South Texas and (iv) $41.1 million of U.S. unproved property abandonments. During 2008, the 48 Company completed and evaluated 81 exploration/extension wells, 62 of which were successfully completed as discoveries. The Companys Lay Creek project was a CBM pilot program located in northwestern Colorado. The Company drilled 18 wells in six separate pilot areas and completed workovers and recompletions on 14 wells drilled by a previous operator. The Company completed water treatment facilities and initiated sales of production in the second quarter of 2008. The success of the pilot program was dependent on the ability to dewater the formation and determining that commercial quantities of gas could be produced. During October 2008, the Company concluded that the project was not commercial and abandoned future dewatering activities. Consequently, the Company recorded a charge of $47.1 million to exploration and abandonments expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008, to eliminate the carrying value of the Lay Creek project. During 2007, significant components of the Companys exploratory dry hole provisions and leasehold abandonments expense included: (i) $72.1 million of suspended well costs written off due to the discontinuation of the Clipper project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico due to increasing costs, (ii) $13.8 million of costs associated with the Companys unsuccessful exploratory well on its Block 256 offshore Nigeria, (iii) $50.8 million for costs associated with two unsuccessful exploratory wells in the Companys Alaskan National Petroleum Reserve area and the write off of the remaining prospect costs in the onshore Alaskan North Slope area and (iv) $13.9 million of Tunisian dry hole provisions and abandonment costs, which primarily related to the write off of a suspended well drilled in 2003 on the Anaguid permit and an unsuccessful exploratory well in both the Jenein Nord permit and the Borj El Khadra permit. During 2007, the Companys seismic activity primarily related to its resource plays in South Texas and the Rocky Mountains. During 2007, the Company completed and evaluated 76 exploration/extension wells, 60 of which were successfully completed as discoveries. During 2006, significant components of the Companys dry hole provisions and leasehold abandonments expense included (i) $34.0 million of costs associated with the Companys unsuccessful exploratory well on its Block 256 prospect offshore Nigeria, including $17.8 million of associated unproved leasehold impairment, (ii) $21.6 million of dry hole provisions recorded for the Companys unsuccessful Cronus, Storms and Antigua prospects in the North Slope area of Alaska, (iii) $16.9 million of dry hole provisions and abandonment costs recognized on prospects drilled in prior periods that were being evaluated for commerciality, including $7.2 million of costs associated with the Companys Boomslang prospect offshore South Africa, $5.5 million of costs associated with two discoveries on the Gulf of Mexico shelf in 2005 and $4.2 million of costs associated with the Companys Anaguid permit in Tunisia, (iv) $16.0 million of dry hole provision and unproved property impairment recognized on the Companys unsuccessful Norphlet prospect in Mississippi and (v) a $14.3 million charge associated with an unsuccessful well on the Companys Flying Cloud prospect in the Gulf of Mexico. During 2006, the Company completed and evaluated 414 exploration/extension wells, 384 of which were successfully completed as discoveries. General and administrative expense. General and administrative expense totaled $141.8 million, $129.6 million and $116.6 million during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expense during 2008, as compared to 2007, was primarily due to (i) expenses associated with the administration of Pioneer Southwest and (ii) continuing increases in performance related compensation costs, including the amortization of share based compensation to officers, directors and employees. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has $48.3 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested share based awards that will be charged to earnings over a weighted average period of less than three years. The Company has initiated cost reduction initiatives in response to commodity price declines experienced during the second half of 2008 and continuing into the first quarter of 2009. See Significant Events for information regarding financial markets, commodity prices and low price environment initiatives. The increase in general and administrative expense during 2007, as compared to 2006, was primarily due to increases in performance related compensation costs, including the amortization of share based awards to officers, directors and employees. Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations. Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations from continuing operations was $8.7 million, $7.0 million and $3.7 million during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations during 2008 and 2007 was primarily due to new wells placed on production. See Note L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the Companys asset retirement obligations. 49 Interest expense. Interest expense was $153.6 million, $135.3 million and $107.1 million during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on the Companys indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 5.5 percent, as compared to 6.5 percent and 6.7 percent for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, including the effects of interest rate derivatives. The $18.3 million increase in interest expense during 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to (i) an $18.2 million increase in interest incurred on senior notes due to an increase in average senior note borrowings outstanding, (ii) a $13.6 million decrease in capitalized interest due to the completion of the South African South Coast Gas project during 2007 and declining capitalized interest on the Oooguruk development project in Alaska, partially offset by (iii) a $12.6 million decrease in interest incurred on the Company credit facility due to declining interest rates. The increase in interest expense for 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to (i) a $44.3 million increase in interest incurred on long term debt due to a $712 million increase in average debt outstanding, primarily related to funding additions to oil and gas properties, (ii) a $5.4 million increase in noncash interest expense attributable to certain discounted liabilities and deferred hedge losses partially offset by (iii) a $20.4 million increase in capitalized interest on the Companys Oooguruk and South Coast Gas development projects in Alaska and South Africa, respectively. The Company expects interest expense to increase in future periods due to declining capitalized interest on the Alaskan Oooguruk development project and as the interest expense recorded on the $480 million of outstanding 2.875% convertible senior notes due 2038 (the 2.875% Senior Convertible Notes) increases to an annual rate of 6.75 percent. See New Accounting Pronouncements &ndash; FSP APB 14 1 for information regarding this accounting change. The increase in interest expense associated with the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement will be a noncash expense. See Note F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information about the Companys long term debt and interest expense. Hurricane activity, net. The Company recorded net hurricane related activity expenses of $12.2 million, $61.3 million and $32.0 million during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, associated with the Companys East Cameron platform facilities, located on the Gulf of Mexico shelf, that were destroyed during 2005 by Hurricane Rita. The Company estimates that it will cost approximately $22 million to complete operations to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron platform facilities. Since January 2007, the Company has expended approximately $163.1 million on operations to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron platform facilities. The Companys estimates to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron facilities are based upon an analysis prepared by a third party engineering firm for a majority of the work and an estimate by the Company for the remaining work that was not covered by the third party analysis. During 2007, the Company commenced legal actions against its insurance carriers regarding certain policy coverage issues. The Company continues to expect that a substantial portion of the loss will be recoverable by insurance. See Note U of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for specific information regarding the Companys East Cameron platform facilities reclamation and abandonment. Minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries net income (loss). Minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries net income (loss) from continuing operations during 2008 was a charge to pretax earnings of $21.6 million, as compared to net credits to pretax earnings of $352 thousand and $2.3 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. The $22.0 million expense increase in 2008, as compared to 2007, is primarily due to $19.2 million of minority interest in the income of Pioneer Southwest and a $2.8 million minority interest in the 2007 net losses of Pioneer Natural Resources Nigeria (320) Limited, which was sold by the Company during 2007. The $1.9 million decrease in minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries net loss for 2007, as compared to 2006, is primarily due to a $2.1 million decrease in minority interest in the net losses of Pioneer Natural Resources Nigeria (320) Limited. See Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding Pioneer Southwest and the Companys minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries net income (loss). Other expenses. Other expenses were $127.1 million during 2008, as compared to $29.4 million during 2007 and $34.3 million during 2006. The $97.7 million increase in other expense during 2008, as compared to 2007, is primarily attributable to (i) a $25.0 million increase in bad debt expense, primarily attributable to $19.6 million in bad debt expense related to the SemGroup bankruptcy, (ii) a $24.8 million increase in rig contract termination 50 charges, (iii) a $21.1 million increase in idle drilling equipment costs during 2008 and (iv) a $10.6 million non hedge derivative loss in 2008. The $4.9 million decrease in other expense during 2007, as compared to 2006, is primarily attributable to (i) an $11.2 million decrease in the Companys postretirement benefit obligations, (ii) an $8.1 million decrease in losses on early extinguishments of debt, (iii) a $6.5 million decrease in non hedge derivative charges and (iv) a $4.0 million decrease in insurance charges, partially offset by (v) a $12.7 million increase in charges related to commodity hedge ineffectiveness and (vi) an $8.4 million increase in the cost of idle drilling equipment. See Note O of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the Companys other expenses. During 2009, the Company intends to continue the implementation of cost reduction initiatives, including actions that will result in additional charges for idle drilling equipment and rig contract terminations. See Significant Events and First Quarter 2009 Outlook above for additional information regarding these initiatives. Income tax provision. The Company recognized income tax provisions on continuing operations of $205.6 million, $112.6 million and $141.0 million during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Companys effective tax rates for 2008, 2007 and 2006 were 48 percent, 32 percent and 48 percent, respectively, as compared to the combined United States federal and state statutory rates of approximately 37 percent. The effective tax rates of 2008, 2007 and 2006 differ from the combined United States federal and state statutory rates primarily due to: &bull; foreign tax rates; &bull; statutes in foreign jurisdictions that differ from those in the United States, including a South African tax law allowing for the deduction of 150 percent of development expenditures, resulting in a $15.7 million tax benefit in 2007; &bull; a $40.9 million tax benefit during 2007 related to the Companys exit from Nigeria; &bull; a $13.8 million tax benefit during 2007 related to the Companys relinquishment of its remaining rights in Gabon and the write off of costs associated with Block H in Equatorial Guinea; &bull; a $15.8 million and $18.9 million U.S. tax provision during 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to the Company no longer having identifiable plans to reinvest South Africa earnings in South Africa; and &bull; expenses for unsuccessful well costs and associated acreage costs in foreign locations where the Company does not expect to receive income tax benefits, principally attributable to unsuccessful wells in Nigeria during 2007 and 2006. See Critical Accounting Estimates below and Note P of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the Companys tax position. Discontinued operations. During 2007 and 2006, the Company sold its interests in the following oil and gas asset groups: Country Description of Asset Groups Date Divested United States Deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields March 2006 Argentina Argentine assets April 2006 Canada Canadian assets November 2007 The Company recognized a loss from discontinued operations of $751 thousand during 2008 as compared to gains from discontinued operations of $130.7 million during 2007 and $589.5 million during 2006. Pursuant to SFAS 144, the results of operations of these assets and the related gains on disposition are reported as discontinued operations. See Note V of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the Companys discontinued operations. Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity Capital commitments. The Companys primary needs for cash are for capital expenditures and acquisition expenditures on oil and gas assets, payment of contractual obligations, dividends/distributions and working capital obligations. Funding for these cash needs, as well as funding for any stock or debt repurchases that the Company may undertake, may be provided by any combination of internally generated cash flow, proceeds from the disposition of nonstrategic assets or external financing sources as discussed in Capital resources below. The 51 Company expects that it will be able to fund its needs for cash (excluding acquisitions) with internal operating cash flows. Acquisitions may be funded with internal operating cash flows or availability under the Companys revolving credit facilities. Although the Company expects that internal operating cash flows will be adequate to fund capital expenditures and dividend/distribution payments, and that available borrowing capacity under the Companys credit facilities will provide adequate liquidity to fund future acquisitions, no assurances can be given that such funding sources will be adequate to meet the Companys future needs. The worldwide economic slowdown has negatively impacted the demand for energy and as a result, commodity prices have declined significantly since their highs earlier in 2008. As a result of the significant decline in commodity prices, the Company has implemented initiatives to reduce capital spending, operating costs and general and administrative expenses to enhance and preserve financial flexibility. Specifically, the Company plans to minimize drilling activities until commodity prices increase, gas price differentials in the areas where the Company produces gas narrow relative to NYMEX quoted gas prices and or well cost reductions can be achieved. As a result, the Company has reduced its rig activity and is pursuing reductions in well costs to align costs with the lower commodity price environment that currently exists. Rigs have been terminated or stacked in the Spraberry, Raton, Edwards Trend and Barnett Shale areas. The Company has reduced its operated rig activity from 29 rigs in the third quarter of 2008 to two rigs during mid February 2009. Oil and gas properties. The Companys cash expenditures for additions to oil and gas properties during 2008, 2007 and 2006 totaled $1.4 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. The Companys 2008 expenditures for additions to oil and gas properties were funded by $1.0 billion of net cash provided by operating activities, $292.9 million of proceeds from the disposition of assets and $166.0 million of proceeds from the initial public offering of Pioneer Southwests common units representing limited partner interests. The Companys 2007 expenditures for additions to oil and gas properties were funded by $775.3 million of net cash provided by operating activities, the net proceeds from the disposition of Canadian assets and borrowings on the Companys line of credit. The Companys 2006 expenditures for additions to oil and gas properties were funded by $754.8 million of net cash provided by operating activities and by a portion of the net proceeds from the disposition of deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine assets. The Company strives to maintain its indebtedness at levels that will provide sufficient financial flexibility to take advantage of future opportunities. The Companys capital budget for 2009 is approximately $250 million to $300 million. The Company currently expects that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund the 2009 capital budget. Off balance sheet arrangements. From time to time, the Company enters into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off balance sheet obligations of the Company. As of December 31, 2008, the material off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that the Company has entered into include (i) undrawn letters of credit, (ii) operating lease agreements, (iii) drilling commitments, (iv) VPP obligations (to physically deliver volumes and pay related lease operating expenses in the future) and (v) contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable, such as derivative contracts that are sensitive to future changes in commodity prices and gas transportation commitments. Other than the off balance sheet arrangements described above, the Company has no transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the Companys liquidity or availability of or requirements for capital resources. See Contractual obligations below for more information regarding the Companys off balance sheet arrangements. Contractual obligations. The Companys contractual obligations include long term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments (including commitments to pay day rates for drilling rigs), derivative obligations, other liabilities, transportation commitments and VPP obligations. 52 The following table summarizes by period the payments due by the Company for contractual obligations estimated as of December 31, 2008: Payments Due by Year 2009 2010 and 2011 2012 and 2013 Thereafter (in thousands) Long term debt (a) $ &mdash; $ &mdash; $ 919,110 $ 2,119,985 Operating leases (b) 20,072 29,310 25,203 70,803 Drilling commitments (c) 96,968 121,648 37,610 &mdash; Derivative obligations (d) 49,561 20,584 &mdash; &mdash; Other liabilities (e) 93,694 26,034 11,414 149,961 Transportation commitments (f) 25,972 46,202 25,385 21,117 VPP obligations (g) 147,906 135,166 42,069 &mdash; $ 434,173 $ 378,944 $ 1,060,791 $ 2,361,866 (a) See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for information regarding estimated future interest payment obligations under long term debt obligations and Note F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The amounts included in the table above represent principal maturities only. (b) See Note I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." (c) Drilling commitments represent future minimum expenditure commitments for drilling rig services and well commitments under contracts to which the Company was a party on December 31, 2008. (d) Derivative obligations represent net liabilities for oil and gas commodity derivatives that were valued as of December 31, 2008. These liabilities include $40.3 million of liabilities that are fixed in amount and are not subject to continuing market risk. The ultimate settlement amounts of the remaining portions of the Companys derivative obligations are unknown because they are subject to continuing market risk. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the Companys derivative obligations. (e) The Companys other liabilities represent current and noncurrent other liabilities that are comprised of postretirement benefit obligations, litigation and environmental contingencies, asset retirement obligations and other obligations for which neither the ultimate settlement amounts nor their timings can be precisely determined in advance. See Notes H, I and L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the Companys postretirement benefit obligations, litigation and environmental contingencies and asset retirement obligations, respectively. (f) Transportation commitments represent estimated transportation fees on gas throughput commitments. See Note I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the Companys transportation commitments. (g) These amounts represent the amortization of the deferred revenue associated with the VPPs. The Companys ongoing obligation is to deliver the specified volumes sold under the VPPs free and clear of all associated production costs and capital expenditures. See Note T of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Capital resources. The Companys primary capital resources are net cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from financing activities and proceeds from sales of nonstrategic assets. Although the Company expects that these resources will be sufficient to fund its capital commitments during the foreseeable future, the recent turmoil in worldwide financial markets have resulted in the availability of external sources of short term and long term capital funding being less certain. During 2008, the Companys net cash provided by operating activities, net proceeds from asset divestitures and net proceeds from Pioneer Southwests initial public offering of common units representing limited partner interests were sufficient to fund its additions to oil and gas properties, but insufficient to fund all capital requirements, resulting in additional borrowings under the Companys credit facility. For 2009, the Company currently expects that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund the Companys $250 million to $300 million capital budget. Asset divestitures. During 2008, the Company terminated derivative assets prior to their contractual maturity dates. The accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2008 includes approximately $155.0 million of proceeds from disposition of assets attributable to these derivative terminations. 53 In November 2007, the Company completed the sale of its Canadian subsidiaries for net proceeds of $525.7 million, resulting in a gain of $101.3 million. The net proceeds from the sale of the Canadian subsidiaries includes $132.8 million of proceeds that were deposited by the purchaser into the Companys Canadian escrow account pending receipt from the Canada Revenue Agency of appropriate tax certifications, which were received in January 2008. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, include approximately $132.0 million and $392.9 million of proceeds from disposition of assets, net of cash sold, respectively, pertaining to the sale of the Canadian subsidiaries. During March 2006, the Company sold all of its interests in certain oil and gas properties in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for net proceeds of $1.2 billion, resulting in a gain of $725.3 million. During April 2006, the Company sold its Argentine assets for net proceeds of $669.6 million, resulting in a gain of $10.9 million. The results of operations for these divestitures are included in the Companys discontinued operations. The net cash proceeds from these divestitures were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness under the Companys credit facility, to fund a portion of additions to oil and gas properties, for stock repurchases and for general corporate purposes. Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities during 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $1.0 billion, $775.3 million and $754.8 million, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2008, as compared to that of 2007, was primarily due to increased sales volumes and increased oil, NGL and gas prices from continuing operations, partially offset by increased production costs. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2007, as compared to that of 2006, was primarily due to increased sales volumes, increased commodity prices and $74.9 million of income realized from the monetization of Alaskan PPT credits. Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities during 2008 was $1.2 billion, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $1.8 billion during 2007 and net cash provided by investing activities of $145.5 million during 2006. The decrease in net cash provided by investing activities during 2008, as compared to 2007, was primarily due to $664.4 million decrease in the additions to oil and gas properties and a $95.2 million decrease in the additions to other assets and other property and equipment, net, partially offset by a decrease of $128.0 million in proceeds from disposition of assets. The decrease in net cash provided by investing activities during 2007, as compared to 2006, was primarily due to $1.6 billion of net proceeds received from the divestiture of assets during 2006, the substantial portion of which resulted from the sale of the Companys deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine assets, and a $663.8 million increase in additions to oil and gas properties during 2007. See Results of Operations above and Note N of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding asset divestitures. Financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2008 was $162.3 million, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1.0 billion for 2007 and net cash used in financing activities of $913.5 million during 2006. During 2008, significant components of financing activities included $225.8 million of net borrowings under long term debt and $166.0 million from the proceeds of the Pioneer Southwest IPO, partially offset by $181.5 million used to purchase 4.7 million shares of treasury stock. During 2007, significant components of financing activities included $1.3 billion of net borrowings under long term debt and $221.4 million of net cash used to purchase 5.2 million shares of treasury stock. During 2006, significant components of financing activities included $554.7 million of net cash used to repay long term borrowings, $348.9 million of net cash used to purchase 8.9 million shares of stock and $31.7 million of dividend payments, partially offset by $17.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of long term incentive plan stock options and employee stock purchases. On January 15, 2008, $3.8 million principal amount of the Companys 6.50% senior notes matured and were repaid with borrowings under its credit facility. During January 2008, the Company issued the 2.875% Senior Convertible Notes and received proceeds, net of approximately $11.3 million of underwriter discounts and offering costs, of approximately $488.7 million. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering to reduce outstanding borrowings under its credit facility. See Note F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the 2.875% Senior Convertible Notes. During April 2008, the Company paid $16.8 million of aggregate dividends ($0.14 per common share). During October 2008, the Company paid $19.2 million of aggregate dividends ($0.16 per common share). Future dividends and the timing and amount thereof are at the discretion of the Board, and the Board is currently considering the Companys dividend policy and may decide to reduce the dividend in the near term to enhance financial flexibility. 54 On May 6, 2008, Pioneer Southwest, a subsidiary of the Company, completed its initial public offering of 9,487,500 common units, representing a 31.6 percent limited partner interest in Pioneer Southwest. Pioneer Southwest owns interests in certain oil and gas properties previously owned by the Company in the Spraberry field in the Permian Basin of West Texas. The Company owns a 0.1 percent general partner interest and a 68.3 percent limited partner interest in Pioneer Southwest. The Company received $166.0 million of net proceeds from Pioneer Southwest in consideration for (i) an ownership interest in a subsidiary of the Company that owned the oil and gas properties prior to the initial public offering and (ii) an incremental ownership interest in certain of the same properties as a result of the exercise of the over allotment option. The net proceeds from the initial public offering were used to reduce the Companys outstanding indebtedness. The Company consolidates Pioneer Southwest into its financial statements and reflects the public ownership as a minority interest in Pioneer Southwests net assets. In conjunction with the completion of the initial public offering, Pioneer Southwest completed a $300 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks, which matures in May 2013 (the Pioneer Southwest Credit Facility). The Pioneer Southwest Credit Facility is available for general partnership purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures and distributions. During December 2008, the Company repurchased $20.0 million principal amount of its outstanding $500.0 million of 2.875% Senior Convertible Notes, $71.5 million principal amount of its outstanding $526.9 million of 5.875% senior notes due 2016, $14.9 million principal amount of its outstanding $500.0 million of 6.65% senior notes due 2017 and $500 thousand principal amount of its outstanding $450.0 million of 6.875% senior notes due 2018. Associated therewith, the Company recognized a gain of $23.2 million, which is included in interest and other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. On August 15, 2007, $32.1 million principal amount of the Companys 8.25% senior notes matured and were repaid with borrowings under the Companys credit facility. During April 2007, the Company amended its existing Amended and Restated $1.5 billion 5 Year Revolving Credit Agreement with an Amended and Restated 5 Year Revolving Credit Agreement (the Credit Facility) to extend the maturity and improve the pricing. The Credit Facility provides for initial aggregate loan commitments of $1.5 billion, which may be increased to a maximum aggregate amount of $2.0 billion if the lenders increase their loan commitments or if loan commitments of new financial institutions are added. The Companys borrowing capacity under the credit facility is subject to a covenant requiring that the Company maintain a specified ratio of the net present value of the Companys oil and gas properties to total debt, with the variables on which the calculation of net present value is based (including assumed commodity prices and discount rates) being subject to adjustment by the lenders. The amount that the Company may borrow under the credit facility in the future could be reduced as a result of lower oil, NGL or gas prices, among other items. See Note F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the significant terms of the amended credit facility. During January 2008, the Company entered into interest rate swap contracts and designated the contracts as cash flow hedges of the forecasted interest rate risk associated with a portion of the Companys credit facility indebtedness. The interest rate swap contracts are variable for fixed rate swaps on $400 million notional amount of debt at a weighted average fixed annual rate of 2.87 percent, excluding any applicable margins. The interest rate swaps have an effective start date during February 2008, $200 million of which terminates in February 2010, with the remaining $200 million terminating in February 2011. During March 2007, the Company issued $500.0 million of 6.65% senior notes due 2017 for net proceeds of $494.8 million. The Company used the net proceeds from the 6.65% senior notes to reduce indebtedness under its credit facility. During May 2006, the Company issued $450.0 million of 6.875% senior notes due 2018 for net proceeds of $447.4 million. The Company used the net proceeds, in part, from the 6.875% senior notes to repurchase $346.2 million of its 6.50% senior notes due 2008 and for general corporate purposes. During 2006, holders of all of the $100.0 million of 4 3/4% senior convertible notes due 2021 exercised their conversion rights. Associated therewith, the Company paid $79.9 million in cash, issued 2.3 million shares of common stock and recorded a $22.0 million increase to stockholders equity. As the Company pursues its strategy, it may utilize various financing sources, including fixed and floating rate debt, convertible securities, preferred stock or common stock. To enhance the Companys financial flexibility, the Company is also evaluating the merits of executing volumetric production payments, the sale for cash of producing assets to Pioneer Southwest and other alternatives. The Company cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of any such actions as they are subject to market conditions, among other factors. The Company may also 55 issue securities in exchange for oil and gas properties, stock or other interests in other oil and gas companies or related assets. Additional securities may be of a class preferred to common stock with respect to such matters as dividends and liquidation rights and may also have other rights and preferences as determined by the Board. Liquidity. The Companys principal source of short term liquidity is cash on hand and unused borrowing capacity under its credit facility. There were $913.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the credit facility as of December 31, 2008. Including $46.0 million of undrawn and outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility, the Company had $541.0 million of unused borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2008. If internal cash flows do not meet the Companys expectations, the Company may further reduce its level of capital expenditures, reduce dividend payments, and or fund a portion of its capital expenditures using borrowings under its credit facilities, issuances of debt or equity securities or from other sources, such as asset sales. The Company cannot provide any assurance that needed short term or long term liquidity will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Although the Company expects that internal cash flows will be adequate to fund capital expenditures and dividend payments, and that available borrowing capacity under the Companys credit facilities will provide adequate liquidity, no assurances can be given that such funding sources will be adequate to meet the Companys future needs. For instance, the amount that the Company may borrow under the credit facility in the future could be reduced as a result of lower oil, NGL or gas prices, among other items. Foreign currency translation. The functional currency of the Companys Canadian subsidiaries was the U.S. dollar (USD) and the Canadian subsidiaries financial statements were maintained in Canadian dollars (CND). In accordance with GAAP, the net assets of the Canadian subsidiaries were translated into USD equivalent amounts when they were consolidated into the financial statements of the Company and resulting translation gains and losses were deferred as items of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the Companys consolidated stockholders equity. As a result of modest fluctuations in the USD to CND exchange rates during 2006, the Company recorded other comprehensive income (loss) in accumulated other comprehensive income &ndash; cumulative translation adjustment (AOCI &ndash; CTA) in consolidated stockholders equity of $8.1 million. However, during 2007 the CND strengthened significantly against the USD, accordingly, the Company recorded $77.7 million of other comprehensive income in AOCI &ndash; CTA. During November 2007, the sale of the Companys common stock in the Canadian subsidiaries was completed, at which time AOCI &ndash; CTA was eliminated as a component of the gain on the divestiture of the Canadian assets. See Note V of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the divestiture of the Canadian subsidiaries. Debt ratings. The Company receives debt credit ratings from Standard & Poors Ratings Group, Inc. (S&P) and Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys), which are subject to regular reviews. S&Ps rating for the Company is BB+ with a stable outlook. Moodys rating for the Company is Ba1 with a negative outlook. S&P and Moodys consider many factors in determining the Companys ratings including: production growth opportunities, liquidity, debt levels and asset and reserve mix. A reduction in the Companys debt ratings could negatively impact the Companys ability to obtain additional financing or the interest rate, fees and other terms associated with such additional financing. As of December 31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants. Book capitalization and current ratio. The Companys net book capitalization at December 31, 2008 was $6.5 billion, consisting of $48.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, debt of $3.0 billion and stockholders equity of $3.6 billion. The Companys debt to book capitalization decreased to 45 percent at December 31, 2008 from 47 percent at December 31, 2007, primarily due to an increase in stockholders equity, partially offset by an increase in indebtedness. The Companys ratio of current assets to current liabilities was .70 to 1.00 at December 31, 2008, as compared to .77 to 1.00 at December 31, 2007. Critical Accounting Estimates The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements for inclusion in this Report in accordance with GAAP. See Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a comprehensive discussion of the Companys significant accounting policies. GAAP represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements, the application of which requires management judgments and estimates including, in certain circumstances, choices between acceptable GAAP alternatives. The following is a discussion of the Companys most critical accounting estimates, judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the Companys application of GAAP. Asset retirement obligations. The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and facilities and to restore the land or seabeds at the end of oil and gas production operations. The Companys removal 56 and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligations, a corresponding adjustment is generally made to the oil and gas property balance. See Notes B and L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the Companys asset retirement obligations. Successful efforts method of accounting. The Company utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities as opposed to the alternate acceptable full cost method. In general, the Company believes that, during periods of active exploration, net assets and net income are more conservatively measured under the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities than under the full cost method. The critical difference between the successful efforts method of accounting and the full cost method is as follows: under the successful efforts method, exploratory dry holes and geological and geophysical exploration costs are charged against earnings during the periods in which they occur; whereas, under the full cost method of accounting, such costs and expenses are capitalized as assets, pooled with the costs of successful wells and charged against the earnings of future periods as a component of depletion expense. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recognized exploration, abandonment, geological and geophysical expense from continuing operations of $235.5 million, 279.3 million and $250.2 million, respectively. During 2007 and 2006, the Company recognized exploration, abandonment, geological and geophysical expense from discontinued operations of $14.4 million and $21.3 million, respectively, under the successful efforts method. Proved reserve estimates. Estimates of the Companys proved reserves included in this Report are prepared in accordance with GAAP and SEC guidelines. The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of: &bull; the quality and quantity of available data; &bull; the interpretation of that data; &bull; the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and &bull; the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate. The Companys proved reserve information included in this Report as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was prepared by the Companys engineers and audited by independent petroleum engineers with respect to the Companys major properties. Estimates prepared by third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein. Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, all of which may substantially differ from future actual results, reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify, positively or negatively, material revisions to the estimate of proved reserves. It should not be assumed that the Standardized Measure included in this Report as of December 31, 2008 is the current market value of the Companys estimated proved reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the Company based the Standardized Measure on prices and costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves. The Companys estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion expense. If the estimates of proved reserves decline, the rate at which the Company records depletion expense will increase, reducing future net income. Such a decline may result from lower market prices, which may make it uneconomical to drill for and produce higher cost fields. In addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of the Companys assessment of its proved properties and goodwill for impairment. Impairment of proved oil and gas properties. The Company reviews its proved properties to be held and used whenever management determines that events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the 57 properties may not be recoverable. Management assesses whether or not an impairment provision is necessary based upon estimated future recoverable proved and risk adjusted probable and possible reserves; its outlook of future commodity prices, production and capital costs expected to be incurred to recover the reserves; discount rates commensurate with the nature of the properties; net cash flows that may be generated by the properties. Proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment at the level at which depletion of proved properties is calculated. See Note S of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for information regarding the Companys impairment assessments. Impairment of unproved oil and gas properties. At December 31, 2008, the Company carried unproved property costs of $204.2 million. Management assesses unproved oil and gas properties for impairment on a project by project basis. Managements impairment assessments include evaluating the results of exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects. Suspended wells. The Company suspends the costs of exploratory wells that discover hydrocarbons pending a final determination of the commercial potential of the oil and gas discovery. The ultimate disposition of these well costs is dependent on the results of future drilling activity and development decisions. If the Company decides not to pursue additional appraisal activities or development of these fields, the costs of these wells will be charged to exploration and abandonment expense. The Company does not carry the costs of drilling an exploratory well as an asset in its consolidated balance sheets following the completion of drilling unless both of the following conditions are met: (i) The well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well. (ii) The Company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Due to the capital intensive nature and the geographical location of certain projects, it may take the Company longer than one year to evaluate the future potential of the exploration well and economics associated with making a determination on its commercial viability. In these instances, the projects feasibility is not contingent upon price improvements or advances in technology, but rather the Companys ongoing efforts and expenditures related to accurately predicting the hydrocarbon recoverability based on well information, gaining access to other companies production, transportation or processing facilities and or getting partner approval to drill additional appraisal wells. These activities are ongoing and being pursued constantly. Consequently, the Companys assessment of suspended exploratory well costs is continuous until a decision can be made that the well has found proved reserves or is noncommercial and is impaired. See Note D of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the Companys suspended exploratory well costs. Assessments of functional currencies. Management determines the functional currencies of the Companys subsidiaries based on an assessment of the currency of the economic environment in which a subsidiary primarily realizes and expends its operating revenues, costs and expenses. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of all of the Companys current international operations. The assessment of functional currencies can have a significant impact on periodic results of operations and financial position. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances. The Company continually assesses both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be realized prior to their expiration. Pioneer monitors Company specific, oil and gas industry and worldwide economic factors and reassesses the likelihood that the Companys net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax attributes in each jurisdiction will be utilized prior to their expiration. There can be no assurance that facts and circumstances will not materially change and require the Company to establish deferred tax asset valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions in a future period. As of December 31, 2008, the Company does not believe there is sufficient positive evidence to reverse its valuation allowances related to certain foreign tax jurisdictions. Goodwill impairment. The Company reviews its goodwill for impairment at least annually. This requires the Company to estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting units that have goodwill. There is considerable judgment involved in estimating fair values, particularly in determining the valuation methodologies to utilize, the estimation of proved reserves as described above and the weighting of different valuation methodologies applied. See Notes B and S of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information. Litigation and environmental contingencies. The Company makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for ongoing litigation and environmental remediation. Actual costs can vary from such estimates for a 58 variety of reasons. The costs to settle litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws and opinions and assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, environmental remediation liabilities are ubject to change because of changes in laws and regulations, developing information relating to the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology. Under GAAP, a liability is recorded for these types of contingencies if the Company determines the loss to be both probable and reasonably estimable. See Note I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the Companys commitments and contingencies. Valuations of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans. The Company is the sponsor of certain defined benefit pension and postretirement plans. In accordance with GAAP, the Company is required to estimate the present value of its unfunded pension and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations. Based on those values, the Company records the unfunded obligations of those plans and records ongoing service costs and associated interest expense. The valuation of the Companys pension and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations requires management assumptions and judgments as to benefit cost inflation factors, mortality rates and discount factors. Changes in these factors may materially change future benefit costs and pension and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations. See New Accounting Pronouncements below and Note H of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the Companys pension and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations. Valuation of stock based compensation. In accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), the Company calculates the fair value of stock based compensation using various valuation methods. The valuation methods require the use of estimates to derive the inputs necessary to determine fair value. The Company utilizes (a) the Black Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options, (b) the stock price on the date of grant for the fair value of restricted stock awards and (c) the Monte Carlo simulation method for the fair value of performance unit awards. New Accounting Pronouncements The following discussions provide information about new accounting pronouncements that were issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) during 2008: SFAS 157. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measures required under other accounting pronouncements, but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. During February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157 2 (FSP FAS 157 2). FSP FAS 157 2 delayed the effective date of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis but no less often than annually. On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities. See Note E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the Companys adoption of SFAS 157. The adoption of the provisions of SFAS 157 that were delayed by FSP FAS 157 2 is not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. SFAS 159. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits entities to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 159 on January 1, 2008 and its implementation did not have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. SFAS 141(R). In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations (SFAS 141(R)). SFAS 141(R) replaces SFAS 141 and provides greater consistency in the accounting and financial reporting of business combinations. SFAS 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of the date that the acquirer achieves control over the business acquired. This includes the measurement of the acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business combination, the recognition of contingent consideration, the recognition of pre acquisition contractual and certain non contractual gain and loss contingencies, the recognition of capitalized research and development costs and the recognition of changes in the acquirers income tax valuation allowance and deferred taxes. The provisions of SFAS 141(R) also require that restructuring costs resulting from the business combination that the acquirer expects but is not required to incur and costs incurred to effect the acquisition be recognized separate from the business combination. SFAS 141(R) is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, 59 beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and is to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the statement is applied. SFAS 141(R) became effective for the Company on January 1, 2009. The implementation of SFAS 141(R) did not impact the financial condition or results of operations of the Company on the date of adoption. SFAS 160. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160 Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB Statement No. 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 amends Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, which is sometimes referred to as minority interest, is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements. Among other requirements, SFAS 160 requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest. It also requires disclosure of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest on the face of the consolidated income statement. SFAS 160 became effective for the Company on January 1, 2009. Although it will not impact the Companys financial condition or results of operations, it will change the manner in which minority interests in subsidiaries net assets and net income (loss) is presented in the Companys consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations. SFAS 161. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities &ndash; an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring entities to provide enhanced disclosures about (i) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (ii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and its related interpretations, and (iii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS 161 became effective for the Company on January 1, 2009 and will only impact future disclosures about the Companys derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS 162. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162 The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (SFAS 162). SFAS 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements presented in conformity with GAAP. SFAS 162 became effective for the Company on November 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 162 did not have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements. FSP APB 14 1. In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1). FSP APB 14 1 specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entitys nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. FSP APB 14 1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of FSP APB 14 1 will increase the annual interest expense that the Company recognizes on its $480 million of outstanding 2.875% Senior Convertible Notes from an annual yield of approximately 2.875 percent to an annual yield equivalent to a nonconvertible debt borrowing (6.75 percent on the date of issuance). The adoption of FSP APB 14 1 will also result in the reclassification of the estimated issuance date fair value of the 2.875% Senior Convertible Notes conversion privilege from long term debt to shareholders equity in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. See Note W for information regarding the impact of adopting FSP APB 14 1. EITF 03 6 1. In June 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. EITF 03 6 1 Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), which addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, need to be included in the net income allocation in computing basic net income per share under the two class method prescribed under SFAS 128, Earnings per Share. FSP 03 6 1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and, to the extent applicable, must be applied retrospectively by adjusting all prior period net income per share data to conform to the provisions of the standard. The adoption of FSP EITF 03 6 1 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys net income per share calculations. 60 SEC reserve ruling. In December 2008, the SEC released Final Rule, "Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting" (the "Reserve Ruling"). The Reserve Ruling revises oil and gas reporting disclosures. The Reserve Ruling also permits the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserves volumes. The Reserve Ruling will also allow companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves to investors. In addition, the new disclosure requirements require companies to: (i) report the independence and qualifications of its reserves preparer or auditor; (ii) file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves estimates or conduct a reserves audit; and (iii) report oil and gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior 12 month period rather than a year end price. The Reserve Ruling becomes effective for annual reports on Forms 10 K for fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 2009. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adoption of the provisions of the Reserve Ruling will have on its financial position, results of operations and disclosures. 61 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following quantitative and qualitative information is provided about financial instruments to which the Company was a party as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and from which the Company may incur future gains or losses from changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. The fair value of the Companys derivative contracts is determined based on counterparties estimates and valuation models. The Company did not change its valuation method during 2008. During 2008, the Company was a party to commodity, interest rate and foreign exchange rate swap contracts and commodity collar contracts. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the Companys derivative contracts, including deferred gains and losses on terminated derivative contracts. The following table reconciles the changes that occurred in the fair values of the Companys open derivative contracts during 2008: Derivative Contract Net Assets (Liabilities) (a) Commodities Interest Rate Foreign Exchange Rate Total (in thousands) Fair value of contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2007 $ (234,410 ) $ &mdash; $ (1,500 ) $ (235,910 ) Changes in contract fair values (b) 213,478 (10,454 ) 1,500 204,524 Contract maturities 236,528 551 &mdash; 237,079 Contract terminations (103,310 ) &mdash; &mdash; (103,310 ) Fair value of contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2008 $ 112,286 $ (9,903 ) $ &mdash; $ 102,383 (a) Represents the fair values of open derivative contracts subject to market risk. The Company also had $40.3 million and $69.9 million of obligations under terminated derivatives as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, for which no market risk exists. (b) At inception, new derivative contracts entered into by the Company have no intrinsic value. Effective February 1, 2009, the Company discontinued hedge accounting on all existing commodity derivative instruments, and from that date forward will account for derivative instruments using the mark to market accounting method. Therefore, the Company will recognize all future changes in the fair values of its derivative contracts as gains or losses in the earnings of the period in which they occur. Quantitative Disclosures Foreign exchange rate sensitivity. During November 2007, the Company invested $131.7 million Canadian dollars (CND), representing $132.8 million U.S. dollars (USD), in a CND denominated escrow account associated with the sale of the Companys Canadian assets. During December 2007, the Company entered into foreign exchange rate derivatives to swap $131.7 million CND for $131.0 million USD to be delivered during May 2008. The foreign exchange rate swaps were economic hedges of the CND denominated escrow account balance; however, uncertainty regarding the matching of cash flow timing between the foreign exchange rate swaps and the liquidation of the CND denominated escrow account caused the Company not to designate the foreign exchange rate swaps as hedges. The CND denominated escrow account was liquidated during January 2008 for $129.0 million USD, at which time the foreign exchange rate swaps were terminated at a gain of $1.8 million USD. Subsequent to these transactions, the Company has no remaining material foreign exchange rate risk associated with financial instruments. Interest rate sensitivity. The following tables provide information about other financial instruments to which the Company was a party as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 that were sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the tables present maturities by expected maturity dates, the weighted average interest rates expected to be paid on the debt given current contractual terms and market conditions and the debts estimated fair value. For fixed rate debt, the weighted average interest rate represents the contractual fixed rates that the Company was obligated to periodically pay on the debt as of December 31, 2008 and 2007. For variable rate debt, the average interest rate represents the average rates being paid on the debt projected forward proportionate to the forward yield curve for LIBOR on February 17, 2009. 62 Interest Rate Sensitivity Debt Obligations as of December 31, 2008 Year Ending December 31, Liability Fair Value December 31, 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total 2008 (dollars in thousands) Total Debt: Fixed rate principal maturities (a) $ &mdash; $ &mdash; $ &mdash; $ 6,110 $ 480,000 $ 1,639,985 $ 2,126,095 $ 1,429,161 Weighted average interest rate 5.74 % 5.74 % 5.74 % 5.73 % 5.74 % 6.83 % Variable rate principal maturities $ &mdash; $ &mdash; $ &mdash; $ 913,000 $ &mdash; $ &mdash; $ 913,000 $ 868,597 Weighted average interest rate 2.10 % 2.64 % 3.45 % 3.92 % Interest Rate Swaps: (b) Notional debt amount 400,000 227,222 25,000 $ 9,903 Fixed rate payable (%) 2.87 % 2.97 % 3.00 % Variable rate receivable (%) 1.35 % 1.89 % 2.70 % (a) Represents maturities of principal amounts excluding (i) debt issuance discounts and premiums and (ii) deferred fair value hedge gains and losses. (b) During January 2008, the Company entered into $400 million notional amount of floating for fixed interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with variable rate indebtedness at a fixed weighted average annual interest rate of 2.87 percent, excluding any applicable margins. The interest rate swaps mature during February 2010 ($200 million notional amount) and 2011 ($200 million notional amount). Interest Rate Sensitivity Debt Obligations as of December 31, 2007 Year Ending December 31, Liability Fair Value December 31, 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total 2007 (dollars in thousands) Total Debt: Fixed rate principal maturities (a) $ 3,777 $ &mdash; $ &mdash; $ &mdash; $ 6,110 $ 1,726,875 $ 1,736,762 $ 1,537,630 Weighted average interest rate 6.55 % 6.55 % 6.55 % 6.55 % 6.55 % 6.76 % Variable rate principal maturities $ &mdash; $ &mdash; $ &mdash; $ &mdash; $ 1,113,000 $ &mdash; $ 1,113,000 $ 1,113,000 Weighted average interest rate 3.51 % 3.91 % 4.78 % 5.38 % 5.48 % (a) Represents maturities of principal amounts excluding (i) debt issuance discounts and premiums and (ii) deferred fair value hedge gains and losses. Commodity price sensitivity. The following tables provide information about the Companys oil and gas derivative financial instruments that were sensitive to changes in oil, NGL and gas prices as of December 31, 2008 and 2007. During the fourth quarter of 2008, market quoted commodity prices declined significantly from levels reported during the first half of 2008. Although mitigated by the Companys derivative activities, declines in commodity prices will reduce the Pioneers revenues and internal cash flows. Recent uncertainties in worldwide financial markets may have the effect of reducing liquidity in the financial derivatives market, hampering the Companys ability to enter into derivative contracts under acceptable terms. 63 Commodity derivative instruments. The Company manages commodity price risk with derivative contracts, such as swap and collar contracts. Swap contracts provide a fixed price for a notional amount of sales volumes. Collar contracts provide minimum (floor) and maximum (ceiling) prices for the Company on a notional amount of sales volumes, thereby allowing some price participation if the relevant index price closes above the floor price. See Notes B, E and J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a description of the accounting procedures followed by the Company relative to its derivative financial instruments and for specific information regarding the terms of the Companys derivative financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in oil, NGL or gas prices.

The Company is a borrower under fixed rate and variable rate debt instruments that give rise to interest rate risk. The Companys objective in borrowing under fixed or variable rate debt is to satisfy capital requirements while minimizing the Companys costs of capital. See Note F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a discussion of the Companys debt instruments. Derivative financial instruments. The Company utilizes interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity price derivative contracts to mitigate interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity price risks in accordance with policies and guidelines approved by the Board. In accordance with those policies and guidelines, the Companys executive management determines the appropriate timing and extent of derivative transactions. Foreign currency, operations and price risk. International investments represent, and are expected to continue to represent, a portion of the Companys total assets. Pioneer currently has international operations in Tunisia and South Africa, which together represented 15 percent of the Companys 2008 oil and gas revenues from continuing operations. Although Pioneers primary focus is directed toward onshore North American opportunities, Pioneer continues to identify and selectively evaluate other international opportunities. As a result of such foreign operations, Pioneers financial results and international operations could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in the legal or regulatory environment, weak economic conditions or changes in political or economic climates and other factors. For example: &bull; local political and economic developments could restrict or increase the cost of Pioneers foreign operations; &bull; exchange controls and currency fluctuations could result in financial losses; &bull; royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims could increase costs of Pioneers foreign operations; &bull; expropriation of the Companys property could result in loss of revenue, property and equipment; &bull; civil uprising, riots, terrorist attacks and wars could make it impractical to continue operations, resulting in financial losses; &bull; compliance with applicable U.S. law could be in conflict with the Companys contractual obligations, the laws of foreign governments or local customs; &bull; import and export regulations and other foreign laws or policies could result in loss of revenues; &bull; repatriation levels for export revenues could restrict the availability of cash to fund operations outside a particular foreign country; and &bull; laws and policies of the U.S. affecting foreign trade, taxation and investment could restrict Pioneers ability to fund foreign operations or may make foreign operations more costly. Pioneer does not currently maintain political risk insurance. Pioneer evaluates on a country by country basis whether obtaining political risk coverage is necessary and may add such insurance in the future if the Company believes it is prudent to do so. Africa. The Companys producing assets in Africa are in South Africa and Tunisia. The Company views the operating environment in these African nations as stable and the economic stability as good. While the values of the various African nations currencies fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar, the Company believes that any currency risk associated with Pioneers African operations would not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations given that such operations are closely tied to oil prices, which are denominated in U.S. dollars. 67
