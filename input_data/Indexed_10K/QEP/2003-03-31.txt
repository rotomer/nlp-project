ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Questar Market Resources (QMR or Market Resources) through its subsidiaries conducts gas and oil exploration, development and production, gas gathering and processing, and energy marketing operations. Primary objectives of energy marketing operations are to support the companys earnings targets and to protect the companys earnings from adverse commodity price changes. The company does not enter into energy hedging contracts for speculative purposes. Wexpro, a subsidiary of QMR, develops gas and oil reserves owned by an affiliate, Questar Gas. Following is a summary of QMRs financial results and operating information: Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (in thousands) OPERATING INCOME Revenues Natural gas sales $ 205,928 $ 226,656 $ 193,359 Oil and natural gas liquids sales 67,572 59,482 59,901 Cost of service gas operations 93,177 89,934 74,492 Energy marketing 218,832 337,845 379,760 Gas gathering, processing and other 43,614 32,480 34,541 Total revenues 629,123 746,397 742,053 Operating expenses Energy purchases 202,132 324,124 369,752 Operating and maintenance 131,598 112,087 106,761 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 117,446 92,678 85,025 Exploration 6,086 6,986 7,917 Abandonment and impairment of gas, oil and related properties 11,183 5,171 3,418 Production and other taxes 28,558 43,125 36,262 Wexpro Agreement oil income sharing 1,676 2,885 4,758 Total operating expenses 498,679 587,056 613,893 Operating income $ 130,444 $ 159,341 $ 128,160 OPERATING STATISTICS Nonregulated production volumes Natural gas (MMcf) 79,674 70,574 68,963 Oil and natural gas liquids (Mbbl) 2,764 2,500 2,225 Total production (bcfe) 96.3 85.6 82.3 Average daily production (MMcfe) 264 234 225 Nonregulated selling price, net to the well Average realized selling price (including hedges) Natural gas (Mcf) $ 2.58 $ 3.21 $ 2.80 Oil and natural gas liquids (bbl) $ 20.39 $ 19.22 $ 20.50 Average selling price (without hedges) Natural gas (Mcf) $ 2.17 $ 3.84 $ 3.29 Oil and natural gas liquids (bbl) $ 22.93 $ 23.14 $ 27.49 Wexpro investment base, net of deferred income taxes (in millions) $ 164.5 $ 161.3 $ 124.8 Energy marketing volumes (Mdthe) 83,816 91,791 105,632 Natural gas gathering volumes (Mdth) For unaffiliated customers 112,205 91,729 92,969 For Questar Gas 40,685 37,161 36,791 For other affiliated customers 38,136 27,049 25,068 Total gathering 191,026 155,939 154,828 Gathering revenue (dth) $ 0.16 $ 0.13 $ 0.13  Exploration and Production Activities In 2002, QMR grew its nonregulated production by 12% to 96.3 bcfe compared to the previous years production of 85.6 bcfe. This 12% increase was achieved despite QMRs sale of producing properties and deliberate curtailment of approximately 3.3 bcfe of production due to low prices. However, revenues were lower in 2002. Low prices, primarily for natural gas produced in the Rocky Mountains, plagued QMR for much of 2002. Rockies prices, net to the well, were below $1.50 per Mcf for much of 2002. Approximately 60% of QMRs production comes from the Rockies. QMR acquired producing properties in the Uinta Basin of Utah in July 2001, which provided a significant portion of the year to year production growth. Also, development of the Uinta Basin properties and the Pinedale Anticline in southwestern Wyoming was the prime contributor to production increases in 2002 and 2001. The basis differential between daily prices in the Rockies and the Henry Hub (Louisiana) at times exceeded $2 per MMBtu, far greater than the historic average of $.40 to $.60. Gas prices in the Rockies have been impacted because transportation capacity out of the region has not kept pace with the regions growing production rate. While this imbalance should be partially remedied with an expansion of the Kern River pipeline, scheduled to begin operation in mid 2003, it may persist for some time. Prices received on production from Midcontinent properties have been much higher. To protect against the possibility that the Rockies basis will again widen in the second and third quarters of 2003, QMR has hedged a substantial portion of its proved developed production in the Rockies. QMRs energy hedges partially mitigated poor Rockies gas prices in 2002. QMR hedged or presold approximately 56% of its nonregulated natural gas production and 78% of its nonregulated oil production. As a result, the average realized selling price for natural gas amounted to $2.58 per Mcf and exceeded unhedged prices by $.41 per Mcf. Oil production hedges reduced the average realized selling price for oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) by $2.54 per barrel. In 2002, hedging activities increased gas revenues by $32.9 million and decreased oil revenues by $7 million. In 2001, hedging activities reduced gas revenues by $44.7 million and oil revenues by $9.8 million. QMR does not hedge its NGL production. A summary of QMRs energy price hedging positions for nonregulated production as of the fourth quarter earnings release dated February 12, 2003 follows: Year Region Net revenue interest production under price hedging contracts Gas (bcf) Average price net to the well Gas per Mcf 2003 Rocky Mountains 32.1 $ 3.04 Midcontinent 12.0 $ 3.60 44.1 $ 3.19 2004 Rocky Mountains 14.5 $ 3.11 Midcontinent 3.4 $ 3.71 17.9 $ 3.22 Oil (Mbbl) Oil per bbl 2003 All regions 1,095 $ 21.80 Lifting cost per Mcfe rose in 2001 due to higher production taxes, which are based on the value of production. The average realized selling price of gas per Mcf decreased 20% in 2002 compared with 2001, and increased 15% in 2001 compared with 2000. The total amount of lease operating expenses increased 6% in 2002 compared with 2001 and 28% in 2001 compared with 2000 reflecting an increase in the number of producing properties. However, on an Mcfe basis, lease operating expenses were down 5% in 2002 versus 2001 and up 26% in 2001 versus 2000, Lease operating expenses primarily include labor, maintenance, repairs and well workovers. For the year ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Per Mcfe Lease operating expense $ 0.55 $ 0.58 $ 0.46 Production taxes 0.17 0.25 0.24 Lifting cost $ 0.72 $ 0.83 $ 0.70 Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense (DD&A) increased 27% in 2002 and 9% in 2001 due to increased gas and oil production and higher average rates per Mcfe. The average DD&A rate per Mcfe is a function of the finding cost of adding reserves and the changing market value of those reserves. By definition, reserve quantities that QMR can disclose and use in DD&A calculations are based on existing economic and operating conditions. For the year ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Per Mcfe Depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 0.91 $ 0.83 $ 0.78 Exploration expense, largely a function of the number of unsuccessful exploratory wells, decreased 13% in 2002 and 12% in 2001. Abandonments and impairments increased in 2002 primarily due to a write off of leasehold costs and a $1.9 million write down of the value of drilling rigs. The four company owned drilling rigs, acquired in 2001 as part of the Shenandoah Energy, Inc. (SEI) acquisition, were sold in early 2003. Abandonments and impairments are noncash expenses.  Interest and other income QMR sold its Canadian subsidiary and producing properties in the Midcontinent and San Juan Basin resulting in a $43.2 million pretax gain, $19.7 million of which related to the Canadian subsidiary. In 2001, assets sales generated a $13.9 million pretax gain. The favorable settlement of a lawsuit resulted in $5.6 million of pretax earnings in 2002.  Debt expense Debt expense was 52% higher in 2002 compared with 2001 primarily due to increased debt to used to fund the purchase of SEI in July of 2001. QMR used proceeds from the sale of assets, which occurred primarily in the fourth quarter of 2002 to reduce debt. The impact of higher debt was partially offset by lower short term interest rates that approached historical lows. Interest expense was flat in 2001 compared with 2000 due to lower short term interest rates.  Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates Pretax earnings from unconsolidated affiliates were $3 million higher in 2002 compared with 2001. Rendezvous LLC began gathering and processing operations in the fourth quarter of 2001 and accounted for approximately a $2 million increase in pretax earnings. QMRs share of pretax earnings from the Blacks Fork partnership increased approximately $1 million in 2002 due to improved gas processing margins from lower gas prices in the Rockies.  Income taxes The effective combined federal, state and foreign income tax rate was 35.2% in 2002, 34.9% in 2001 and 33.2% in 2000. Income tax rates were below the combined income rate of about 40% primarily due to nonconventional fuel credits, which amounted to $4.9 million in 2002, $5 million in 2001 and $4.7 million in 2000. Under current law, the federal income tax credit for production from a nonconventional source will be discontinued for production sold after December 31, 2002.  Wexpro Earnings Wexpros net income was $2.6 million higher in 2002 as a result of an increased investment base when compared to December 31, 2001. The investment base, net of deferred income taxes and depreciation, grew as a result of successful drilling. Wexpro conducts cost of service development of gas reserves owned by Questar Gas. Cost of service refers to Wexpros contracted entitlement to reimbursement of its costs and an approved return on investment for operating Questar Gass properties. Oil is sold at market prices. Any net income from oil sales remaining after recovery of expenses and Wexpros return on investment is shared between Wexpro and Questar Gas. Questar Gass portion is reported as an expense under oil income sharing on the income statement.  Gas Gathering and Energy Marketing Activities Revenues for gathering and processing were $11.1 million higher in 2002 compared with the same period in 2001 as a result of gathering systems in the Uinta Basin acquired as part of the July 2001 SEI acquisition and increased production in the Rockies. The volume of gas gathered and the average gathering rate both increased 23% over the previous year. Marketing margins improved by $3 million in 2002 compared with 2001 in spite of lower prices and lower marketing volumes in 2002. Marketing volumes were 9% lower in 2002 compared with 2001. The margin represents revenues less purchase and transportation costs.  Nonregulated Gas and Oil Reserves In 2002, gas and oil reserves declined 6%, after production and sales of producing properties, to 1,113 bcfe. QMRs reserve replacement ratio was 26% in 2002 and 631% in 2001. In 2001, QMR acquired 415 bcfe of proved gas and oil reserves in the SEI acquisition. Reserve additions, revisions and purchases, and sales in place, amounted to 25 bcfe in 2002 and 540 bcfe in 2001. In 2002, QMR completed the sale of its Canadian subsidiary, and producing properties in the San Juan Basin and other areas. The sales accounted for a 122 bcfe decrease in reserves. Excluding these sales, the 2002 reserve replacement ratio was 153%. As a result of the property sales, QMR begins 2003 with a production base of 83 to 85 bcfe. The five year average finding cost per Mcfe for the past three years, excluding Wexpro, was $.85 in 2002 and 2001, and $.86 in 2000.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (in thousands) Net income $ 97,929 $ 101,134 $ 77,808 Noncash adjustments to net income 147,041 119,572 108,121 Changes in operating assets and liabilities 16,524 30,592 (54,680 ) Net cash provided from operating activities $ 261,494 $ 251,298 $ 131,249 Net cash provided from operating activities increased in 2002 compared with 2001 as a result of larger noncash adjustments to income. Net cash provided from operating activities increased 91% in 2001 compared with 2000 as a result of 30% higher net income and collection of accounts receivable and the return of interest bearing deposits with energy brokers. Investing Activities QMR participated in 277 wells (158 net) that resulted in 147 net gas wells, seven net oil wells and four net dry holes. There were 43 gross count wells in progress at year end. QMRs success rate was 98% in 2002. QMR acquired the remaining 50% interest in the Blacks Fork processing plant in December of 2002. The company invested $12.5 million in the Rendezvous partnership that provides gas gathering and compression services to producers in southwestern Wyoming. The details of capital expenditures for 2002, 2001 and a forecast of 2003 are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2003 Forecast 2002 2001 (in thousands) Exploratory drilling and other exploration $ 6,200 $ 5,966 $ 5,523 Development drilling 128,600 112,173 132,440 Wexpro drilling 25,200 24,065 55,651 Reserve acquisitions 65 370,068 Production 13,800 14,191 7,624 Gathering and processing 43,900 31,407 53,914 Storage 4,700 40 11,754 General 2,400 1,453 1,533 $ 224,800 $ 189,360 $ 638,507 Financing Activities In 2002, QMR made a concerted effort to reduce debt resulting from the July 2001 acquistion of SEI. Cash flow provided from operations and the sale of assets funded a $119 million reduction of debt, and capital expenditures. In 2002, proceeds from asset dispositions amounted to $158 million. On January 16, 2002, QMR sold $200 million of five year private placement notes with a 7% interest rate and used the proceeds to repay short term debt. In November 2002, Moodys downgraded debt ratings of Questar and subsidiaries one level after completing a review that began May 2, 2002. Moodys established a Baa3 rating for the senior unsecured debt of QMR. Also, Moodys established a stable outlook for each Questar entity. A lower debt rating may increase the companys cost of debt; however, Moodys revised ratings are solidly investment grade. The downgrade will not materially affect the companys growth strategy. Standard & Poors has assigned a BBB+ to debt issued by QMR. Standard & Poors has a negative outlook, reflecting concerns that the Questars risk profile may increase with its plan to grow unregulated businesses. QMRs consolidated capital structure consisted of 49% long term debt and 51% common shareholders equity at December 31, 2002. Critical Accounting Policies The companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported results of operations and financial position. Management believes that the following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment on the part of management.  Successful Efforts Accounting for Gas and Oil Operations Under the successful efforts method of accounting, the company capitalizes the costs of leaseholds, development wells, successful exploratory wells and related equipment and facilities. The costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells are charged to expense when it is determined that such wells have not located proved reserves. Unproved leasehold costs are periodically reviewed for impairment. Costs related to impaired prospects are charged to expense. Costs of geological and geophysical studies and other exploratory activities are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred. The company recognizes a gain or loss on the sale of properties on a field basis. Capitalized proved leasehold costs are depleted using the unit of production method based on proved reserves on a field basis. All other capitalized costs associated with gas and oil properties are depreciated using the unit of production method based on proved developed reserves on a field basis. The company engages independent consultants to help calculate nonregulated gas and oil reserves. Reserve estimates are based on a complex and highly interpretive process that is subject to continuous revision as additional production and development drilling information becomes available.  Wexpro Agreement Wexpros operations are subject to the terms of the Wexpro Agreement. The agreement was effective August 1, 1981, and sets forth the rights of Questar Gass utility operations to share in the results of Wexpros successful development operations and the rate of return that Wexpro will earn for managing Questar Gass reserves. The agreement was approved by the Public Service Commission of Utah (PSCU) and the Public Service Commission of Wyoming (PSCW) in 1981 and affirmed by the Utah Supreme Court in 1983.  Accounting for Derivatives QMR uses derivative instruments, typically fixed price swaps, to hedge against a decline in the average selling prices of its gas and oil production. Accounting rules for derivatives require that these instruments be marked to fair value at the balance sheet reporting date. The difference between fair value and carrying value is reported either in net income or comprehensive income depending on the structure of the derivatives. The company has structured virtually all of its energy derivative instruments as cash flow hedges. Any changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded on the balance sheet and in comprehensive income or loss until the underlying gas or oil is produced. When a derivative is terminated before its contract expires, the associated gain or loss is recognized in income over the life of the previously hedged production.  Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized in the period that services are provided or products are delivered. The companys exploration and production operations use the sales method of accounting for gas revenues, whereby revenue is recognized on all gas sold to purchasers. A liability is recorded to the extent that the company has an imbalance in excess of its share of remaining reserves in an underlying property. Revenue and prices for gas and oil are reported on a "net to the well" basis.  New Accounting Standard Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," was issued in June of 2001. SFAS 143 addresses the financial accounting and reporting of the fair value of legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. The new standard requires that plant abandonment costs be estimated at fair value, capitalized and depreciated over the life of the related assets. The new standard will impact recording abandonment costs of gas and oil wells and processing plants. The company has not completed its evaluation of the impact of SFAS 143. However, these expenses are noncash until abandonment takes place. SFAS 143 is effective beginning January 1, 2003.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK QMRs primary market risk exposures arise from commodity price changes for natural gas, oil and other hydrocarbons and changes in interest rates. QMR sold its Canadian affiliate in the fourth quarter of 2002, eliminating its foreign exchange risk. A QMR subsidiary has long term contracts for pipeline capacity for the next several years and is obligated for transportation services with no guarantee that it will be able to recover the full cost of these transportation commitments. QMR bears a majority of the risk associated with commodity price changes and uses energy price hedging arrangements in the normal course of business to limit the risk of adverse price movements. However, these same arrangements typically limit future gains from favorable price movements. The hedging contracts exist for a significant share of QMR owned gas and oil production and for a portion of energy marketing transactions. Commodity Price Risk Management The company has established policies and procedures for managing commodity price risks through the use of derivatives. The primary objectives of energy price hedging are to support the companys earnings targets and to protect earnings from downward movements in commodity prices. The volume of production hedged and the mix of derivative instruments employed are regularly evaluated and adjusted by management in response to changing market conditions and reviewed periodically by the companys Board of Directors. It is the companys current policy to hedge up to 75% of the current years proved developed production by the first of March in the current year, at or above selling prices that support its budgeted income. The company will add incrementally to these hedges to reach forward beyond the current year when price levels are attractive. The company does not enter into derivative arrangements for speculative purposes and does not hedge undeveloped reserves. Natural gas prices in the Rocky Mountain region were depressed in 2002. The basis differential, the difference between Rockies prices and the benchmark Henry Hub (Louisiana) price, at times exceeded $2.00 per MMBtu, the widest differential in nearly a decade. This widening basis differential results from a combination of increased regional production, weak seasonal demand, and inadequate capacity in pipelines that transport Rockies gas out of the region. Rockies prices may remain depressed until regional demand increases and or major new export pipelines are built. The expansion of the Kern River pipeline will improve pipeline capacity out of the Rockies but may not immediately return Rockies basis to historical ranges. With the acquisition of SEI in 2001, increased investment in development of the companys Pinedale Anticline acreage and sale of Canadian properties, a growing percentage of the companys production is in the Rockies. Managements attention has been focused on improving Rockies prices by hedging approximately 90% of Rockies 2003 proved developed production at an average of $3.04 per Mcf net to the well. In addition, the company may curtail production if prices drop below levels necessary for profitability. QMR held energy price hedging contracts covering the price exposure for about 85.2 million dth of gas and 1.1 million bbl of oil as of December 31, 2002. A year earlier QMR hedging contracts covered 70.2 million dth of natural gas and 1.1 million bbl of oil. QMR does not hedge the price of natural gas liquids. A summary of the activity for the fair value of energy price hedging contracts for the year ended December 31, 2002, is below. The calculation is comprised of the valuation of financial and physical contracts. (in thousands) Net fair value of energy hedging contracts outstanding at Dec. 31, 2001 $ 50,897 Contracts realized or otherwise settled (42,362 ) Increase in energy prices on futures markets (29,196 ) Net fair value of energy hedging contracts outstanding at Dec. 31, 2002 $ (20,661 ) A vintaging of energy price hedging contracts as of December 31, 2002, is shown below. About 76% of those contracts will settle and be reclassified from other comprehensive income in the next 12 months. (in thousands) Contracts maturing by Dec. 31, 2003 $ (15,621 ) Contracts maturing between Dec. 31, 2004 and Dec. 31, 2005 (5,047 ) Contracts maturing between Dec. 31, 2005 and Dec. 31, 2006 50 Contracts maturing between Dec. 31, 2006 and Dec. 31, 2008 (43 ) Net fair value of energy hedging contracts outstanding at Dec. 31, 2002 $ (20,661 ) QMRs mark to market valuation of gas and oil price hedging contracts plus a sensitivity analysis follows: As of December 31, 2002 2001 (in millions) Mark to market valuation asset (liability) $ (20.7 ) $ 50.9 Value if market prices of gas and oil decline by 10% (22.2 ) 65.7 Value if market prices of gas and oil increase by 10% (19.1 ) 36.1 The calculations reflect energy prices posted on the NYMEX, various "into the pipe" postings, and fixed prices on the indicated dates. These sensitivity calculations do not consider changes in the fair value of the corresponding scheduled physical transactions for price hedges on equity production, (i.e., the correlation between the index price and the price to be realized for the physical delivery of gas or oil production) which should largely offset the change in value of the hedge contracts.  Interest Rate Risk Management QMR held $350 million of fixed rate debt with a fair value of $385.1 million at December 31, 2002. The fair value of fixed rate debt is subject to change as interest rates fluctuate. The company held floating rate long term debt at December 31, 2002 and 2001 amounting to $200 million and $253.9 million, respectively. The book value of variable rate debt approximates fair value. If interest rates declined by 10%, the annual interest costs paid on variable rate long term debt would decrease about $.4 million based on the balance outstanding at December 31, 2002 and $.7 million for the year earlier balance.  Liquidity Accelerators QMR has commodity price hedging agreements in place with ten different counterparties. These counterparties are banks and energy trading firms. In some contracts, the amount of credit allowed before QMR must post collateral for out of the money hedges varies depending on the credit rating assigned to QMRs debt. At QMRs current credit ratings, the credit available from each counterparty ranges between $5 million and $30 million, depending on the agreement. In cases where this arrangement exists, if QMRs credit ratings fall below investment grade (BBB by Standard & Poors or Baa2 by Moodys), counterparty credit generally falls to zero.  Business with Energy Merchants QMR has significant gas sales to energy merchants, some of which have had their debt ratings downgraded. All companies with such concerns were current on their accounts as of the date of this report. QMR requests credit support and, in some cases fungible collateral, from companies with noninvestment grade ratings. QMRs five largest nonaffiliated customers are BP Energy Company, Reliant Energy Services, Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, Sempra Energy Trading Corporation and Oneok Energy Marketing. Transactions with these five companies accounted for 14% of QMRs revenues.
