ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION. Questar Market Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company or Market Resources) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Questar Corporation (Questar). Market Resources, through its subsidiaries, conducts gas and oil exploration, development and production, gas gathering and processing, wholesale energy marketing and operates a private gas storage facility. Questar Exploration and Production (Questar E&P), conducts exploration, development and production activities. Wexpro Company (Wexpro) operates and develops cost of service reserves for an affiliate, Questar Gas. Questar Gas Management (Gas Management) gathers and processes natural gas. Questar Energy Trading (Energy Trading) markets equity and third party gas and oil, provides risk management services and through its interest in Clear Creek Storage Company, LLC, operates an underground gas storage reservoir. Market Resources uses price hedges to protect earnings and cash flows from adverse commodity price changes, but does not enter into gas and oil hedging contracts for speculative purposes. Following is a summary of Market Resources financial results and operating information: Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (in thousands) OPERATING INCOME Revenues Natural gas sales $285,118 $205,928 $226,656 Oil and natural gas liquids sales 67,020 67,572 59,482 Cost of service gas operations 100,997 93,177 89,934 Energy marketing 357,346 218,832 337,845 Gas gathering, processing and other 58,527 43,614 32,480 Total revenues 869,008 629,123 746,397 Operating expenses Energy purchases 342,476 202,132 324,124 Operating and maintenance 130,680 131,598 112,087 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 121,316 117,446 92,678 Exploration 4,498 6,086 6,986 Abandonment and impairment of gas, oil and related properties 4,151 11,183 5,171 Production and other taxes 53,343 28,558 43,125 Wexpro settlement agreement oil income sharing 2,199 1,676 2,885 Total operating expenses 658,663 498,679 587,056 Operating income $210,345 $130,444 $159,341 OPERATING STATISTICS Nonregulated production volumes Natural gas (MMcf) 78,811 79,674 70,574 Oil and natural gas liquids (Mbbl) 2,324 2,764 2,500 Total production (bcfe) 92.8 96.3 85.6 Average daily production (MMcfe) 254 264 234 Nonregulated sales price, net to the well Average realized sales price (including hedges) Natural gas (per Mcf) $3.62 $2.58 $3.21 Oil and natural gas liquids (per bbl) $23.39 $20.39 $19.22 Average sales price (without hedges) Natural gas (per Mcf) $4.17 $2.17 $3.84 Oil and natural gas liquids (per bbl) $28.47 $22.93 $23.14 Wexpro investment base at December 31, net of depreciation and deferred income taxes (in millions) $172.8 $164.5 $161.3 Energy marketing volumes (Mdthe) 80,196 83,816 91,791 Natural gas gathering volumes (Mdth) For unaffiliated customers 114,774 112,205 91,729 For Questar Gas 41,568 40,685 37,161 For other affiliated customers 46,150 38,136 27,049 Total gathering 202,492 191,026 155,939 Gathering revenue (per dth) $0.20 $0.16 $0.13 Exploration and Production Activities Market Resources 2003 net income benefited from higher prices for natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids. Realized natural gas prices, net to the well, increased 40% year over year compared to 2002. Realized oil and natural gas liquid prices, net to the well, increased 15% in 2003. A change in accounting for asset retirement obligations reduced Questar E&P income by $4.6 million in 2003. Approximately two thirds of Market Resources annual nonregulated production is in the Rockies region and one third in the Midcontinent region. Rockies prices increased 53% in 2003 versus 2002. Rockies prices benefited from the expansion of a regional pipeline in May 2003 which added 0.9 bcf per day of transportation capacity. The Rockies basis differential measured against the NYMEX benchmark averaged $1.93 per MMbtu from May 2002 to April 2003 and fell to $0.60 per MMbtu between May and December 2003. In response to lower gas prices in 2002 Questar E&P shut in 3.3 bcfe of Rockies gas production. Midcontinent realized natural gas prices were 27% higher in 2003 compared with 2002. Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (per Mcf) Average realized gas prices by region (including hedges) Rockies $3.27 $2.14 $2.83 Midcontinent 4.26 3.35 3.54 Canada 2.22 3.25 Total 3.62 2.58 3.21 The Company has hedged 67.9 bcf of forecasted 2004 natural gas production at $4.02 per Mcf, net to the well. Net to the well prices reflect adjustments for basis, gathering and processing fees, and quality. Market Resources hedged or presold approximately 70% of nonregulated gas production in 2003 at an average price of $3.38 per Mcf, net to the well. The 2003 hedges resulted in a $43.2 million revenue reduction compared with revenues that would have been realized had the Company not hedged its production. About 53% of nonregulated oil production was hedged or presold at an average price of $21.80 per bbl, net to the well, resulting in an $11.8 million reduction in oil revenues. In 2002 hedging activities added $32.9 million to gas revenues and reduced oil revenues by $7 million. Market Resources hedges gas and oil production when prices are attractive to lock in acceptable returns and cash flow, and to protect against price declines. The Company believes hedging lowers risk and thus lowers cost of capital. Nonregulated natural gas equivalent production was 4% lower in 2003 compared to the prior year due to natural decline and sale of noncore producing properties, including the Companys Canadian subsidiary. Adjusted for property sales, production was 10% higher in 2003 at 92.8 bcfe compared with 84 bcfe in 2002. Overall Rockies production increased 9% year over year. Midcontinent production declined 2% in 2003 due to natural decline and the sale of noncore producing properties in 2002. Following is a table showing production volumes by region: Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (in bcfe) Region Rockies 60.9 56.1 36.3 Midcontinent 31.9 32.7 38.3 Canada 7.5 11.0 Total 92.8 96.3 85.6 Market Resources expects to replace natural gas and oil production and continue to grow nonregulated reserves in 2004, primarily through increased development drilling in the Rockies and continued development drilling in the Midcontinent. Market Resources completed its first full year of a program designed to accelerate the pace of drilling while reducing the environmental impact of its development activities on the Pinedale Anticline in western Wyoming. During 2003 Market Resources drilled and completed 25 gross (17.1 net) new wells at Pinedale. In addition, two wells were drilled to intermediate casing points, and one well was drilling at year end. Market Resources net nonregulated Pinedale production totaled 15.2 bcfe for 2003 compared to 8.6 bcfe in 2002 a 76% increase. During the winter of 2002 2003 Market Resources conducted long term production tests on six wells that were drilled to test the deeper Mesaverde Formation at Pinedale. The Mesaverde immediately underlies the main Lance Formation pay interval. Based on encouraging test results, all 2003 Pinedale wells were drilled and completed in both the Lance and Mesaverde pay intervals. 2003 drilling results demonstrate the widespread productive potential of the Mesaverde on the Companys Pinedale acreage. Also during 2003 Market Resources demonstrated that pad drilling at Pinedale is technically feasible and commercially viable at current commodity prices. By directionally drilling up to 16 development wells from each surface location, Market Resources can develop this world class gas accumulation while minimizing the surface disturbance and environmental impact on critical mule deer winter rangeland. With year round drilling, Market Resources projects that it could drill all remaining wells on its Pinedale acreage with only nine new drilling pads. The Company is working with various stakeholders on a five year study to assess the impact of winter drilling on wildlife. In 2004 Market Resources will evaluate the deeper potential of the Pinedale acreage. To date, the Company has only drilled down to depths of about 14,500 feet on the Pinedale structure. A number of potentially productive deeper formations at depths of up to 19,500 feet remain untested. While there are examples of prolific production from these formations and depths elsewhere in the Rockies, the deeper potential on the Companys acreage has not been evaluated. Only one well, 20 miles to the south of Market Resources acreage, has been drilled below the Mesaverde Formation on the Pinedale Anticline. Drilled in 1972, the well encountered a series of potential reservoir horizons but had mechanical problems and was never tested conclusively. Production from Questar E&Ps Uinta Basin properties in eastern Utah grew 8% to 29 bcfe in 2003. Production data indicates well performance in some areas is falling significantly below projections made at the time the Company acquired Shenandoah Energy (SEI). Current average reserves for all Wasatch Formation wells completed to date is approximately 0.8 bcfe per well compared to predicted reserves of 1.0 to 1.2 bcfe at the time of the acquisition. Factors causing reduced well performance include high variability of the size, quality and thickness of individual reservoirs and difficulties in optimizing the gathering system to handle the highly variable flowing wellhead pressures that exist between different vintage wells. Market Resources continues to adjust its reserve base to reflect performance related revisions. Higher sales prices in 2003 resulted in higher production taxes. Lease operating expenses were lower in the 2003 period after the 2002 sale of higher cost Canadian and other noncore properties. Depreciation, depletion and amortization rates increased in 2003 due to higher costs and in part due to lower estimated reserves in Questar E&Ps Uinta Basin properties. A comparison of costs for nonregulated production is shown in the table below: Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (per Mcfe) Lease operating expense $0.49 $0.55 $0.58 Production taxes 0.33 0.17 0.25 Lifting costs 0.82 0.72 0.83 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 0.95 0.91 0.83 General and administrative expense 0.29 0.27 0.24 Allocated interest expense 0.23 0.27 0.21 Total $2.29 $2.17 $2.11 Nonregulated Gas and Oil Reserves In 2003 gas and oil reserves increased 4%, after production and sales of producing properties, to 1,159 bcfe. Questar E&Ps nonregulated production replacement ratio was 149% in 2003 and 26% in 2002. Net reserve additions, revisions, purchases and sales in place totaled 138 bcfe in 2003 and 25 bcfe in 2002. Questar E&Ps five year average finding cost of nonregulated reserves per Mcfe was $0.84 in 2003 and $0.85 in both 2002 and 2001. Proved nonregulated reserves by major operating areas at December 31, 2003 follow: bcfe Percentage Rocky Mountains Pinedale Anticline 443.2 38% Uinta Basin 303.3 26 Other Rocky Mountains 133.0 12 Subtotal Rocky Mountains 879.5 76 Midcontinent 279.2 24 Total Nonregulated reserves 1,158.7 100% Wexpro Earnings Wexpro earned $32.6 million in 2003 compared to $30.8 million in 2002 due to increased investment in gas development wells, higher realized prices for oil, capitalized interest associated with construction, and lower debt expense. Wexpro manages and develops gas reserves on behalf of Questar Gas. Wexpro activities are governed by a long standing agreement (Wexpro Agreement) with the States of Utah and Wyoming. Pursuant to the Wexpro Agreement, Wexpro produces gas on behalf of Questar Gas, recovers its costs and receives an after tax return of approximately 19% on its net investment in commercial wells and related facilities known as the investment base adjusted for working capital, deferred taxes, and depreciation. Wexpros 2003 results included a $563,000 after tax charge for the cumulative effect of an accounting change for asset retirement obligations. Gas Gathering and Processing; Gas and Oil Marketing Net income from gas gathering and marketing operations increased 18% to $13.0 million in 2003. Gathering volumes increased 11.5 MMdth to 202.5 MMdth in 2003 as the result of increased investment in gathering facilities in the Pinedale area. Gas Managements December 2002 purchase of the remaining 50% of the Blacks Fork processing plant added $1.9 million to income in 2003. Pre tax earnings from Gas Managements 50% interest in Rendezvous Gas Services increased from $2.2 million in 2002 to $4.7 million in 2003. Rendezvous provides gas gathering services for the Pinedale/Jonah producing areas. Energy Tradings margins revenues less the costs to purchase gas and oil and transport gas declined $1.8 million in 2003 due primarily to losses from long term transportation contracts that were above market rates for much of 2003. Interest and Other Income In 2002 Market Resources sold noncore properties resulting in a $43.2 million pretax gain and favorably settled a lawsuit and other contracts resulting in $5.6 million of pretax earnings. Sales of noncore properties generated a $13.9 million pretax gain in 2001. Debt Expense Debt expense was 19% lower in 2003 compared with 2002 primarily due to lower debt balances. Market Resources used proceeds from fourth quarter 2002 asset sales and cash flow from operations to reduce debt. Debt expense was 52% higher in 2002 compared with 2001 primarily due to increased debt used to fund the purchase of SEI in July of 2001. The impact of higher debt was partially offset by lower short term interest rates. Earnings from Unconsolidated Affiliates Rendezvous Gas Services income increased in 2003 due to higher volumes and rates. Gas Management is a 50% owner in Rendezvous, which provides gas gathering services for the Pinedale/Jonah producing area of western Wyoming. Gas Managements share of earnings from the Blacks Fork processing plant are included in the 2002 and 2001 results. Gas Management became the sole owner of the Blacks Fork processing plant in the fourth quarter of 2002. Income Taxes The effective combined federal, state and foreign income tax rate was 36.3% in 2003, 35.2% in 2002 and 34.9% in 2001. The Section 29 income tax credit associated with production of nonconventional fuels expired December 31, 2002. Section 29 credits were $4.9 million in 2002 and $5 million in 2001. Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Method On January 1, 2003 the Company adopted a new accounting rule, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations and recorded a cumulative effect that reduced net income by $5.1 million. SFAS 143 accretion expense was $2.3 million in 2003. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (in thousands) Net income $115,990 $97,929 $101,134 Noncash adjustments to net income 195,637 146,952 119,572 Changes in operating assets and liabilities (42,127) 16,613 30,592 Net cash provided from operating activities $269,500 $261,494 $251,298 Net cash provided from operating activities increased 3% in 2003 compared with 2002 due to increased to income and noncash adjustments to income. Higher realized prices for gas and oil in 2003 resulted in an increased investment in receivables, inventories and hedging collateral deposits. Net cash provided from operating activities increased in 2002 compared with 2001 primarily due to higher depreciation and deferred income taxes. Investing Activities Market Resources increased its investment in the Pinedale Anticline development project in 2003. Market Resources plans to drill and complete 30 wells at Pinedale in 2004 compared to 25 in 2003 and an average of about 15 wells per year in the 2000 2002 periods. In 2003 Market Resources participated in 352 wells (146 net), resulting in 136 net successful gas and oil wells and 10 net dry or abandoned wells. The net drilling success rate was 93% in 2003. There were 39 gross wells in progress at year end. In 2003 Gas Management invested $14.8 million in the Rendezvous partnership. Capital expenditures for 2002 and 2003 and a forecast for 2004follows: Year Ended December 31, 2004 Forecast 2003 2002 (in thousands) Drilling and other exploration $ 16,300 $ 11,055 $ 5,966 Development drilling 157,600 146,608 112,173 Wexpro development drilling 31,500 33,028 24,065 Reserve acquisitions 2,492 65 Production 14,800 9,687 14,191 Gathering and processing 21,400 31,448 31,407 Storage 500 333 40 General 3,800 3,480 1,453 $245,900 $238,131 $189,360 Financing Activities Net cash from operations exceeded the sum of net investing activities and dividends by $23.1 million in 2003 and $212.8 million in 2002. Market Resources paid down its revolving debt by $145 million. In 2002 the Company generated more than $158 million of cash through the sale of noncore assets and used the proceeds to repay debt. Market Resources consolidated capital structure consisted of 40% debt and 60% shareholder equity at December 31, 2003. Moodys and Standard & Poors have rated Market Resources senior unsecured debt Baa3 and BBB+, respectively. Maturing long term debt and the fair value of hedging contracts at December 31, 2003 resulted in current liabilities in excess of current assets. The Company has negotiated a new credit facility to replace an existing facility that matures in April 2004. The new facility has terms that are comparable to or better than the maturing facility and extends through March 2009. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commitments Market Resources enters into a variety of contractual cash obligations and other commitments in the course of ordinary business activities. The following table summarizes the Companys significant contractual cash obligations: Payments Due by Year Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 After 2008 (in millions) Long term debt $405.0 $55.0 $ $200.0 $150.0 Transportation and storage contracts 53.3 5.4 10.9 10.1 26.9 Operating leases 7.6 2.1 4.1 1.4 Total $465.9 $62.5 $15.0 $211.5 $176.9 Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Assumptions The Companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported results of operations and financial position. The following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment on the part of management: Successful Efforts Accounting for Gas and Oil Operations The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for gas and oil property acquisitions, exploration, development and production activities. Under this method, the acquisition costs of proved and unproved properties, successful exploratory wells and development wells are capitalized. Other exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs, the costs of carrying unproved property and unsuccessful exploratory well costs are expensed. Costs to operate and maintain wells and field equipment are expensed as incurred. The costs of unproved properties are generally combined and amortized over the expected holding period for such properties. Individually significant unproved properties are periodically reviewed for impairment. Net capitalized costs of unproved properties are reclassified as proved property when related proved reserves are determined or charged against the impairment allowance when abandoned. Capitalized proved property acquisition costs are amortized by field using the unit of production method based on proved reserves. Capitalized exploratory well and development costs are amortized similarly by field based on proved developed reserves. The calculation takes into consideration estimated future equipment dismantlement, surface restoration and property abandonment costs, net of estimated equipment salvage values. Other property and equipment is generally depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives or the unit of production method for certain processing plants. A gain or loss is generally recognized only when an entire field is sold or abandoned, or if the unit of production amortization rate would be significantly affected. The Company engages independent consultants to prepare estimates of the nonregulated proved gas and oil reserves. Reserve estimates are based on a complex and highly interpretive process that is subject to continuous revision as additional production and development drilling information becomes available. Long lived assets are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated on a field by field basis. If the undiscounted pretax cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value which is determined using discounted future net revenues. Wexpro Agreement Wexpro activities are governed by a long standing agreement, the Wexpro Agreement, with the states of Utah and Wyoming. Pursuant to this agreement, Wexpro produces gas on behalf of Questar Gas and is reimbursed for incurred costs. In addition, Wexpro receives an after tax return on its investment in commercial wells and related facilities known as the investment base adjusted for working capital, deferred taxes and depreciation. The Wexpro Agreement also sets forth the rights of Questar Gass utility operations to share a portion of the profits from Wexpros oil development operations after the recovery of costs and an allowed return. The Wexpro Agreement was approved by the Public Service Commission of Utah and the Public Service Commission of Wyoming in 1981 and affirmed by the Utah Supreme Court in 1983 (See Item 8, Note 11). Accounting for Derivatives The Company uses derivative instruments, typically fixed price swaps, to hedge against a decline in the average market price of its gas and oil production. Accounting rules for derivatives require that these instruments be marked to fair value at the balance sheet reporting date. The difference between fair value and carrying value is reported either in net income or comprehensive income depending on the structure of the derivatives. The Company has structured virtually all energy derivative instruments as cash flow hedges as defined in SFAS 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities as amended. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded on the balance sheet and in comprehensive income or loss until the underlying gas or oil is produced. When a derivative is terminated before its contract expires, the associated gain or loss is recognized as income over the life of the previously hedged production. Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized in the period that services are provided or products are delivered. The Companys exploration and production operations use the sales method of accounting for gas, oil and NGL revenues, whereby revenue is recognized on all gas, oil and NGL sold to purchasers. A liability is recorded to the extent that the Company has an imbalance in excess of its share of remaining reserves in an underlying property. Revenues and prices for gas, oil, and NGL are reported on a net to the well basis after adjustments for basis, gathering and processing fees, and quality. Recent Accounting Developments The Securities and Exchange Commission has requested that the Financial Accounting Standards Board review the applicability of certain provisions of SFAS 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. For a discussion of recent accounting developments, see disclosures in Item 8, Note 1. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Market Resources primary market risk exposures arise from commodity price changes for natural gas, oil and other hydrocarbons and volatility in interest rates. Energy Trading has long term contracts for pipeline capacity and is obligated for transportation services with no guarantee that it will be able to recover the full cost of these transportation commitments. Commodity Price Risk Management Market Resources bears the risk associated with commodity price changes and uses gas and oil price hedging arrangements in the normal course of business to limit the risk of adverse price movements. However, these same arrangements typically limit future gains from favorable price movements. The hedging contracts exist for a significant share of Market Resources owned gas and oil production and for a portion of gas and oil marketing transactions. Market Resources has established policies and procedures for managing commodity price risks through the use of derivatives. Natural gas and oil price hedging support Market Resources earnings, rate of return and cash flow targets and protect earnings from downward movements in commodity prices. The volume of hedged production and the mix of derivative instruments are regularly evaluated and adjusted by management in response to changing market conditions and reviewed periodically by Market Resources Board of Directors. The Company may to hedge up to 100% of forecast production from proved developed reserves when prices are attractive. Proved developed production represents production from existing wells. Market Resources does not enter into derivative arrangements for speculative purposes and does not hedge undeveloped reserves. Hedges are matched to equity gas and oil production, thus qualifying as cash flow hedges under the accounting provisions of SFAS 133 as amended and interpreted. Gas hedges are structured as fixed price swaps into regional pipelines, locking in basis and hedge effectiveness. That portion of hedges no longer deemed effective is immediately recognized in the income statement. The ineffective portion of hedges was not significant in 2003, 2002 and 2001. As of December 31, 2003 approximately 80% of forecast 2004 gas production is hedged at an average price of $4.02 per Mcf, net to the well. Hedges are more heavily weighted to the Rockies to reduce basis risk and to protect returns on capital. In addition, Market Resources could curtail production if prices drop below levels necessary for profitability. Market Resources enters into commodity price hedging arrangements with several banks and energy trading firms. Generally, the contracts allow some amount of credit before Market Resources is required to deposit collateral for out of the money hedges. In some contracts, the amount of credit allowed before Market Resources must post collateral varies depending on the credit rating assigned to Market Resources debt. At Market Resources current credit ratings, the credit available from each counterparty ranges between $5 million and $20 million, depending on the agreement. In cases where this arrangement exists, if Market Resources credit ratings fall below investment grade (BBB by Standard & Poors or Baa3 by Moodys), counterparty credit generally falls to zero. The Company maintains lines of credit to cover potential collateral calls. Collateral required at December 31, 2003 was $9.1 million. A summary of Market Resources hedging positions for equity production as of February 18, 2004 is shown below. Prices are net to the well. Currently, all hedges are fixed price swaps with creditworthy counterparties, which allows the Company to achieve a known price for a specific volume of production delivered into a regional sales point, i.e., incorporating a known basis. The swap price is then reduced by gathering costs and adjusted for product quality to determine the net to the well price.

At December 31, 2003 all oil price hedging contracts had expired. Early in 2004 oil hedging opportunities at attractive prices allowed Market Resources to hedge oil prices covering 733,000 barrels of oil. A year earlier Market Resources hedging contracts covered 85.2 million dth of natural gas and 1.1 million barrels of oil. The Company does not hedge the price of natural gas liquids. A reconciliation of the fair value of hedging contracts for the 12 months ended December 31, 2003 is shown below. The reconciliation incorporates the valuation of financial and physical contracts.
