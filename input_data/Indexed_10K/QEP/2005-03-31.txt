ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION. RESULTS OF OPERATION Market Resources operates through several subsidiaries. Questar Exploration and Production Company (Questar E&P) acquires, explores for, develops and produces gas and oil. Wexpro Company (Wexpro) manages, develops and produces cost of service reserves for affiliated company, Questar Gas. Questar Gas Management Company (Gas Management) provides gas gathering and processing services for affiliates and third parties. Questar Energy Trading Company (Energy Trading) markets equity and third party gas and oil, provides risk management services, and through Clear Creek Storage Company, LLC, operates an underground gas storage reservoir. Following is a comparison of net income by line of business. Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Change 2004 v. 2003 Change 2003 v. 2002 Net income (loss) (in thousands) Questar E&P $ 108,158 $ 70,403 $ 56,182 $ 37,755 $ 14,221 Wexpro 35,303 32,642 30,791 2,661 1,851 Gas Management 21,047 13,333 9,119 7,714 4,214 Energy Trading and other 903 (388) 1,837 1,291 (2,225) Total $ 165,411 $115,990 $ 97,929 $ 49,421 $ 18,061 Market Resources Consolidated Results Market Resources 2004 net income grew to $165.4 million versus $116.0 million in 2003, a 43% increase. Operating income increased $66.2 million, or 31%, in the year to year comparison from $210.3 million to $276.5 million. Total revenues increased $316.3 million, or 36%, in 2004. Revenue growth was driven by increased production, higher realized natural gas, oil and NGL prices at Questar E&P, increased throughput, higher gathering fees and improved processing margins at Gas Management, and an increased investment base in Wexpro. Revenues include sales to affiliates. Expenses increased in the 2004 period due to increased abandonment expense, exploration expense, production taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, and lease operating expense. Net income in 2003 was reduced by $5.1 million due to the cumulative effect of implementing SFAS 143, a new accounting rule governing the treatment of retirement costs of long lived assets. Market Resources 2002 net income included a $26.8 million after tax gain from asset sales. Following is a summary of Market Resources financial results and operating information. Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) OPERATING INCOME Revenues Natural gas sales $ 375,220 $285,118 $205,928 Oil and natural gas liquids sales 86,336 67,020 67,572 Cost of service gas operations 116,747 100,997 93,177 Energy marketing 525,276 348,002 212,087 Gas gathering, processing and other 81,702 67,871 50,359 Total revenues 1,185,281 869,008 629,123 Operating expenses Energy purchases 518,437 342,476 202,132 Operating and maintenance 144,668 130,680 131,598 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 142,688 121,316 117,446 Exploration 9,239 4,498 6,086 Abandonment and impairment of gas, oil and other properties 15,758 4,151 11,183 Production and other taxes 73,243 53,343 28,558 Wexpro Agreement oil income sharing 4,702 2,199 1,676 Total operating expenses 908,735 658,663 498,679 Operating income $276,546 $210,345 $130,444 OPERATING STATISTICS Nonregulated production volumes Natural gas (in MMcf) 89,801 78,811 79,674 Oil and natural gas liquids (in Mbbl) 2,281 2,324 2,764 Total production (in bcfe) 103.5 92.8 96.3 Average daily production (in MMcfe) 283 254 264 Average commodity price, net to the well Average realized price (including hedges) Natural gas (per Mcf) $4.18 $3.62 $2.58 Oil and natural gas liquids (per bbl) $30.97 $23.39 $20.39 Average sales price (excluding hedges) Natural gas (per Mcf) $5.11 $4.17 $2.17 Oil and natural gas liquids (per bbl) $38.10 $28.47 $22.93 Wexpro net investment base at December 31, (in millions) $182.8 $172.8 $164.5 Natural gas gathering volumes (in thousands of MMBtu) For unaffiliated customers 128,721 114,774 112,205 For Questar Gas 38,997 41,568 40,685 For other affiliated customers 56,958 46,150 38,136 Total gathering 224,676 202,492 191,026 Gathering revenue (per MMBtu) $0.22 $0.20 $0.16 Natural gas and oil marketing volumes (in Mdthe) 94,783 80,196 83,816 Questar E&P Results Questar E&P 2004 net income was $108.2 million compared to $70.4 million in 2003, a 54% increase. Higher profits were driven by increased production and higher realized natural gas, oil and NGL prices. Questar E&P 2003 net income benefited from higher prices for natural gas, oil and NGL. Realized oil and NGL prices increased 15% in 2003. Realized natural gas prices increased 40% year over year compared to 2002. A change in accounting for asset retirement obligations reduced Questar E&P income by $4.6 million in 2003. Questar E&P production increased 12% to 103.5 bcfe in 2004 versus 92.8 bcfe in the prior year. Production growth was driven by accelerated development drilling on the Pinedale Anticline in western Wyoming and a 17% year over year increase from Midcontinent properties. Natural gas remains the primary focus of Questar E&Ps exploration and production strategy. On an energy equivalent ratio, natural gas comprised approximately 87% of 2004 production A comparison of gas equivalent production by region are shown in the following table. Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (in bcfe) Rocky Mountains Pinedale Anticline 23.5 15.2 8.6 Uinta Basin 24.8 29.0 26.8 Rockies Legacy 18.0 16.7 20.7 Subtotal Rocky Mountains 66.3 60.9 56.1 Midcontinent Tulsa 19.9 13.9 14.5 Oklahoma City 17.3 18.0 18.2 Subtotal Midcontinent 37.2 31.9 32.7 Canada 7.5 Total production 103.5 92.8 96.3 At December 31, 2004, Market Resources operated 104 producing wells on the Pinedale Anticline compared to 76 at the end of 2003. Questar E&Ps 2004 production from Pinedale was 23.5 bcfe compared to 15.2 bcfe in 2003. Production volumes from the Uinta Basin in eastern Utah decreased 15% in 2004 compared to 2003. Uinta Basin production decline has flattened significantly, with second half 2004 production volumes essentially equal to first half 2004. Production from Rockies legacy properties was 18.0 bcfe in 2004 compared to 16.7 bcfe in 2003, an 8% increase. Legacy properties include all of Questar E&Ps Rocky Mountain producing properties except Pinedale and the Uinta Basin. Continued good performance from Questar E&Ps Hartshorne coalbed methane development project in the Arkoma Basin of eastern Oklahoma and ongoing infill development drilling on the Elm Grove prope rties in northwest Louisiana drove Midcontinent results. Current year Midcontinent production was up 5.3 bcfe, or 17%, compared to 2003. Questar E&P benefited from higher realized prices for natural gas, oil and NGL in 2004. The weighted average realized natural gas price for Questar E&P (including the effects of hedging) was $4.18 per Mcf in 2004 compared to $3.62 per Mcf for 2003, a 15% increase. For 2004, realized oil and NGL prices averaged $30.97 per bbl (including the effects of hedging), compared with $23.39 per bbl in 2003, a 32% increase. A comparison of average realized prices by region, including hedges, is shown in the following table. Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Natural gas (per Mcf) Rocky Mountains $3.95 $3.27 $2.14 Midcontinent 4.57 4.26 3.35 Canada 2.22 Volume weighted average 4.18 3.62 2.58 Oil and NGL (per bbl) Rocky Mountains $30.10 $21.95 $19.72 Midcontinent 32.98 27.04 21.67 Canada 21.03 Volume weighted average 30.97 23.39 20.39 Realized natural gas prices in Questar E&Ps core Rockies areas increased significantly in 2004 compared to 2003. Approximately 63% of Questar E&Ps 2004 natural gas production came from Rockies properties. Rockies basis, the regional difference between Rockies prices and the reference Henry Hub price, averaged approximately $0.90 per MMBtu for 2004 compared to $1.27 per MMBtu for 2003. The May 2003 completion of a major interstate pipeline expansion that delivers Rockies gas to western U. S. markets alleviated the transportation bottleneck that adversely affected Rockies gas prices during much of the first half of 2003. About two thirds of 2003 production was in the Rockies region and one third in the Midcontinent region. Rockies gas prices increased 53% in 2003 versus 2002. In response to lower gas prices in 2002 Questar E&P shut in 3.3 bcfe of Rockies gas production. Midcontinent realiz ed natural gas prices were 27% higher in 2003 compared with 2002. Approximately 76% of Questar E&Ps gas production in 2004 was hedged or pre sold at an average price of $4.04 per Mcf net to the well. Net to the well prices reflect adjustments for regional basis, gathering and processing costs, and gas quality. Hedging reduced gas revenues $83.9 million in 2004. Market Resources also hedged or pre sold approximately 66% of its oil production in 2004 at an average net to the well price of $30.98 per bbl. Hedging reduced oil revenues $16.3 million during 2004. Market Resources may hedge up to 100% of its forecasted production from proved developed reserves to lock in acceptable returns on invested capital and to protect cash flows and earnings from a decline in commodity prices. Market Resources has continued to take advantage of higher natural gas and oil prices to add to its hedge positions in 2005, 2006 and 2007. Natural gas and oil hedges as of De cember 31, 2004, are summarized in Item 7A. of this report. Questar E&P pre income tax cost structure is summarized in the following table. Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (per Mcfe) Lease operating expense $0.50 $0.49 $0.55 Production taxes 0.46 0.34 0.18 Lifting costs 0.96 0.83 0.73 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1.02 0.96 0.92 General and administrative expense 0.30 0.29 0.27 Allocated interest expense 0.21 0.23 0.27 Total $2.49 $2.31 $2.19 Lifting costs were $0.13 per Mcfe higher in 2004 versus 2003 due primarily to a 35% increase in production taxes resulting from higher sales prices of natural gas, oil and NGL. Most production taxes are based on a fixed percentage of commodity sales prices. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased 6% in 2004 compared to a year ago due to higher reserve replacement costs and ongoing depletion of older, lower cost successful efforts pools. Increased competition for rigs and other services in core operating areas, along with sharply higher steel prices, has increased drilling and completion costs. General and administrative expenses increased $0.01 per Mcfe, or 3%, in 2004 versus 2003 due primarily to higher labor and employee benefit costs and higher compliance costs. Allocated interest decreased about 9% on a unit of production basis to $0.21 per Mcfe versus $0.23 per M cfe in 2003 due primarily to increased production volumes. Lease operating expenses were lower in the 2003 period after the 2002 sale of higher cost Canadian and other properties. Higher sales prices in 2003 compared with 2002 resulted in higher production taxes. Depreciation, depletion and amortization rates increased in 2003 over 2002 due to higher costs and, in part, lower estimated reserves in Questar E&Ps Uinta Basin properties. In 2004 impairments totaling $5.7 million were recognized for Bovina field in Mississippi due to collapsed casing on one well, and the uneconomic coalbed methane play at the Copper Ridge Unit in Wyoming. Dry hole expense of $3.9 million was recorded for the unsuccessful deeper exploratory zones in a Brady Field well in western Wyoming. Pinedale Anticline Drilling Activity During 2004 Market Resources drilled and completed 28 wells, had four additional wells drilled to intermediate casing point and suspended until May 2005, and had three wells waiting on completion at year end. Two of the wells waiting on completion were completed and turned to sales in January 2005. In addition, two rigs were actively drilling on the winter pad on December 31, 2004. In mid July 2004, Market Resources commenced drilling a well to test the deep potential of its Pinedale acreage. The 19,500 foot Stewart Point 15 29 well, designed to test the potential of the Rock Springs and Blair formations beneath the Lance Pool pay zones at Pinedale, was delayed over two months due to sage grouse activity. The pace of drilling on the well was hampered by chronic mechanical problems with the contracted drilling rig and inexperienced rig crews. In November 2004, drilling operations were suspended at intermediate casing point at a depth of 14,200 feet and the rig was released. A different rig will be used to finish drilling the well to total depth when operations resume in May 2005. Pinedale Anticline Year Round Drilling Proposal On April 15, 2004, Market Resources submitted a proposal to the BLM seeking a long term exception to the winter drilling restrictions on its Pinedale acreage from November 15 through May 1. On November 9, 2004, a BLM Decision gave Market Resources approval to phase in over the next year the companys proposed year round drilling program. The BLM decision allows Market Resources to operate two drilling rigs on one pad during the winter of 2004 2005. After proposed water and condensate gathering lines are completed in 2005, Market Resources will be allowed to operate six rigs from three active pads beginning in the winter of 2005 2006 through the winter of 2013 2014. Market Resources believes that year round drilling from pads is the most efficient and environmentally responsible approach for developing its Pinedale acreage. Market Resources year round drilling program will shorten the anticipated development drilling period from 18 years to about 9 years. Market Resources can drill up to 16 directional wells per single surface pad. With year round drilling, surface disturbance will be reduced initially by about two thirds from almost 1,500 acres currently allowed to around 500 acres. Surface disturbance would be further reduced to less than 250 acres with post drilling reclamation. Other benefits of Market Resources year round drilling program include a substantial reduction in emissions, noise, dust and traffic compared to the current situation in which activities are compressed into the summer months. Year round drilling also creates year round jobs and thus a more stable, better trained, more productive and safer workforce in the drilling and completion service industries. Market Resources has committed to build pipelines to transport condensate and water production off the portion of the Pinedale Anticline where Market Resources acreage is located. The pipelines will eliminate the need for storage tanks at each location and up to 25,500 tanker truck trips per year at peak production. Other key components of the BLM decision are funding for continued monitoring of mule deer and other critical wildlife, monitoring air quality, and habitat enhancement on contiguous undeveloped areas of Market Resources Pinedale leasehold. Pinedale Anticline 20 Acre Spacing Approved During the third quarter of 2004, the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission issued a formal order approving 20 acre density drilling of Lance Pool (Lance and Mesaverde Formation) wells on all of Market Resources Pinedale Anticline acreage held at the end of 2003 (approximately 14,800 acres). With 20 acre spacing Market Resources has up to 470 total well locations on its Pinedale leasehold (including several recently acquired tracts that have not yet been approved for 20 acre spacing) with approximately 359 locations remaining to be drilled at the end of 2004. Market Resources has over 17,951 gross acres under lease at Pinedale. Questar E&P and Wexpro have a combined 67% average working interest in the 470 total development locations covering approximately 9,400 productive acres in the Lance Pool (combined Lance and Mesaverde formations) at Pinedale. Of the 470 gross Lance Pool develo pment locations on Market Resources leasehold, Questar E&P has about 263 net locations and Wexpro has about 54. Market Resources estimates that each 20 acre spaced well drilled and completed in the Lance and Mesaverde Formations will recover between 3.8 and 8.8 bcfe of gross incremental reserves. Questar E&Ps average working interest in horizons beneath the productive limits of the Lance Pool is approximately 75%. Wexpro has no working interest in deeper horizons. New Pinedale Leases During the third quarter of 2004, Questar E&P acquired additional federal leases on 2,018 acres adjacent to the southwest side of the current 14,800 acre leasehold. Subject to approval of 20 acre spacing, this newly acquired Pinedale acreage may add up to 32 drilling locations. Questar E&P has a 100% working interest in these new leases. Several groups have appealed the issuance of these leases. Wexpro Wexpro net income increased 8% to $35.3 million in 2004 compared to $32.6 million in 2003. Wexpro manages, develops and produces gas reserves for affiliated company Questar Gas. Wexpro activities are governed by a long standing agreement (Wexpro Agreement) with the states of Utah and Wyoming. Pursuant to the Wexpro Agreement, Wexpro recovers its costs and receives an unlevered after tax return of approximately 19% on its net investment in commercial wells and related facilities known as the investment base adjusted for working capital, deferred taxes, and depreciation. Wexpros net investment base increased to $182.8 million at December 31, 2004, up $10 million over 2003. Wexpros net income also benefited from higher oil and NGL prices in 2004. Wexpro earned $32.6 million in 2003 compared to $30.8 million in 2002 due to increased investment in gas development wells, higher realized prices for oil, capitalized interest associated with construction, and lower debt expense. Wexpros 2003 results included a $0.5 million after tax charge for the cumulative effect of an accounting change for asset retirement obligations. Gas Management Net income from gas gathering and processing services increased 58% to $21 million in 2004 versus $13.3 million in 2003. Gathering margins increased by $7 million due to an 11% increase in volumes and a 2.3 cent per MMBtu increase in gathering rates. Pinedale production and new projects serving third parties in the Uinta Basin are driving the expanded service. Gas Management gas processing margins (revenue from the sale of natural gas liquids less natural gas purchases and operating expenses) improved by 7.6 cents per gallon due to higher NGL sales prices. To reduce processing margin volatility, Gas Management began hedging NGL prices in 2004 using forward sales contracts. Hedging reduced NGL revenues by $0.5 million in 2004. Net income from gas gathering and processing operations increased 46% to $13.3 million in 2003 compared to 2002. Gathering volumes increased 11.5 MMBtu to 202.5 MMBtu in 2003 as the result of increased investment in gathering facilities in the Pinedale area. Pre tax earnings from Gas Managements 50% interest in Rendezvous increased to $5 million in 2004 from $4.7 million for 2003 and $2.2 million in 2002. Rendezvous provides gas gathering services for the Pinedale and Jonah producing areas. Energy Trading Net income from Energy Trading was $0.9 million in 2004 compared to a loss of $0.4 million in the year earlier period. Gross margins for gas and oil marketing (gross revenues less the costs to purchase gas and oil, commitments to gas transportation contracts on interstate pipelines, and gas storage costs), increased to $6.8 million for 2004 versus $5.4 million for 2003. Current year results were positively impacted by higher unit margins and increased sales volumes. Gross margins declined in 2003 compared with 2002 due primarily to losses from long term transportation contracts that were above market rates for much of 2003. Energy Trading is the sole member in Clear Creek Storage, LLC, which operates the Clear Creek natural gas storage facility in southwestern Wyoming. Clear Creek has working gas storage capacity of approximately 3 bcf and is connected to four interstate pipelines Kern River, Northwest, Overthrust and Questar Pipeline. Consolidated Operating Results After Operating Income Interest and Other Income In 2002 Market Resources sold noncore properties resulting in a $43.2 million pretax gain and favorably settled a lawsuit and other contracts resulting in a $5.6 million of pretax earnings. Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates Rendezvous Gas Services income increased in 2004 due to higher gas throughput on its gathering system. Gas Management is a 50% member in Rendezvous, which provides gas gathering services for the Pinedale Jonah producing area of western Wyoming. Gas Management became the sole owner of the Blacks Fork processing plant in the fourth quarter of 2002 after owning a 50% interest in prior periods. Debt Expense Lower debt balances and long term interest rates resulted in lower debt expense in 2004 compared with 2003. Market Resources reduced its revolving long term debt by $55.0 million in 2004 and $145.0 million in 2003. Income Taxes The effective combined federal, state and foreign income tax rate was 35.5% in 2004, 36.3% in 2003 and 35.2% in 2002. The Section 29 income tax credit associated with production of nonconventional fuels expired December 31, 2002. The nonconventional fuel credits amounted to $4.9 million in 2002. Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Methods On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted a new accounting rule, SFAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations and recorded a cumulative effect that reduced net income by $5.1 million. SFAS 143 accretion expense amounted to $2.8 million and $2.3 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Net income $165,411 $115,990 $ 97,929 Noncash adjustments to net income 234,602 195,637 146,952 Changes in operating assets and liabilities 13,001 (53,497) 13,243 Net cash provided from operating activities $413,014 $258,130 $258,124 Net cash provided from operating activities increased 60% in 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to increased income, changes in operating assets and liabilities and noncash adjustments to income. Investing Activities In 2004 Market Resources increased drilling activity at Pinedale and in the Midcontinent region. During 2004 Market Resources participated in 413 wells (167.3 net), resulting in 160.7 net successful gas and oil wells and 6.6 net dry or abandoned wells. The net drilling success rate was 96% in 2004. There were 67 gross wells in progress at year end. Market Resources also increased investment in its midstream gathering and processing services business to expand capacity in both western Wyoming and eastern Utah in response to growing equity and third party production volumes. Capital expenditures for 2003 and 2004 and a forecast for 2005 follow. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Forecast 2004 2003 (in thousands) Drilling and other exploration $ 17,400 $ 29,229 $ 11,055 Development drilling 220,800 222,455 146,608 Wexpro development drilling 47,800 39,184 33,028 Reserve acquisitions 1,131 2,492 Production 13,400 13,640 9,687 Gathering and processing 71,500 26,979 31,448 Storage 300 1,171 333 General 4,300 12,040 3,480 375,500 345,829 238,131 Capital expenditure accruals (13,023) (11,370) Total capital expenditures $375,500 $332,806 $226,761 Financing Activities Net cash flow provided from operating activities exceeded the sum of net capital expenditures and dividends by $64.9 million in 2004 and $23.1 million in 2003. The Company used surplus cash flow generated from operations plus the collection of loans to Questar to repay debt. Market Resources repaid $55 million of revolving long term debt in 2004 and paid down its revolving debt by $145 million in 2003. Short term borrowings amounted to $61.2 million at December 31, 2004, compared with $36.5 million a year earlier. The weighted average interest rate on short term debt balances at December 31 was 2.42% in 2004 and 1.30% in 2003. Market Resources consolidated capital structure consisted of 34% combined short and long term debt and 66% common shareholders equity at December 31, 2004. A year earlier debt represented 40% and shareholders equity 60% of capitalization. Moodys and Standard & Poors have rated Market Resources senior unsecured debt Baa3 and BBB+, respectively. Moodys ratings are designated as stable while the Standard & Poors ratings carry a negative outlook qualifier. The fair value of hedging contracts at December 31, 2004, caused current liabilities to exceed current assets. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commitments In the course of ordinary business activities, Market Resources enters into a variety of contractual cash obligations and other commitments. The following table summarizes the significant contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2004. Payments Due by Year Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 After 2009 (in millions) Long term debt $350.0 $200.0 $150.0 Transportation and storage contracts 58.7 $7.2 13.6 $11.4 26.5 Operating leases 6.0 2.3 3.5 .2 Total $414.7 $9.5 $217.1 $11.6 $176.5 Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Assumptions Market Resources significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 accompanying the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this report. The Companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported results of operations and financial position. The following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment on the part of management. Successful Efforts Accounting for Gas and Oil Operations The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for gas and oil property acquisitions, exploration, development and production activities. Under this method, the acquisition costs of proved and unproved properties, successful exploratory wells and development wells are capitalized. Other exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs, the delay rental and administrative costs associated with unproved property and unsuccessful exploratory well costs are expensed. Costs to operate and maintain wells and field equipment are expensed as incurred. The capitalized costs of unproved properties are generally combined and amortized over the expected holding period for such properties. Individually significant unproved properties are periodically reviewed for impairment. Capitalized costs of unproved properties are reclassified as proved property when related proved reserves are determined or charged against the impairment allowance when abandoned. Capitalized proved property acquisition costs are amortized by field using the unit of production method based on proved reserves. Capitalized exploratory well and development costs are amortized similarly by field based on proved developed reserves. The calculation takes into consideration estimated future equipment dismantlement, surface restoration and property abandonment costs, net of estimated equipment salvage values. Other property and equipment are generally depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives or the unit of production method for certain processing plants. A gain or loss is generally recognized only when an entire field is sold or abandoned, or if the unit of production amortization rate would be significantly affected. Questar E&P engages independent reservoir engineering consultants to prepare estimates of the proved gas and oil reserves. Reserve estimates are based on a complex and highly interpretive process that is subject to continuous revision as additional production and development drilling information becomes available. Long lived assets are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated on a field by field basis. If the undiscounted pretax cash flows are less than the net book value of the asset group, the asset value is written down to estimated fair value which is determined using discounted future net revenues. Accounting for Derivatives The Company uses derivative instruments, typically fixed price swaps, to hedge against a decline in the realized prices of its gas and oil production. Accounting rules for derivatives require that these instruments be marked to fair value at the balance sheet reporting date. The change in fair value is reported either in net income or comprehensive income depending on the structure of the derivatives. The Company has structured virtually all energy derivative instruments as cash flow hedges as defined in SFAS 133 as amended. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded on the balance sheet and in comprehensive income or loss until the underlying gas or oil is produced. When a derivative is terminated before its contract expires, the associated gain or loss is recognized in income over the life of the previously hedged production. Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized in the period that services are provided or products are delivered. Questar E&P uses the sales method of accounting whereby revenue is recognized for all gas, oil and NGL sold to purchasers. Revenues include estimates for the two most recent months using published commodity index prices and volumes supplied by field operators. A liability is recorded to the extent that Questar E&P has an imbalance in excess of its share of remaining reserves in an underlying property. Energy Trading revenues are presented on a gross revenue basis. Recent Accounting Developments Refer to Note 1 accompanying the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. for a discussion of recent accounting developments. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Market Resources primary market risk exposures arise from commodity price changes for natural gas, oil and NGL, estimation of gas and oil reserves and volatility in interest rates. Energy Trading has long term contracts for pipeline capacity and is obligated for transportation services with no guarantee that it will be able to recover the full cost of these transportation commitments. Commodity Price Risk Management Market Resources bears the risk associated with commodity price changes and uses gas and oil price hedging arrangements in the normal course of business to limit the risk of adverse price movements. However these same arrangements typically limit future gains from favorable price movements. Hedging contracts are used for a significant share of Questar E&P owned gas and oil production and for a portion of gas and oil marketing transactions and for some of Gas Managements NGL. Market Resources has established policies and procedures for managing commodity price risks through the use of derivatives. Natural gas and oil price hedging supports Market Resources rate of return and cash flow targets and protects earnings from downward movements in commodity prices. The volume of hedged production and the mix of derivative instruments are regularly evaluated and adjusted by management in response to changing market conditions and reviewed periodically by the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Market Resources may hedge up to 100% of forecast nonregulated production from proved developed reserves when prices meet earnings and cash flow objectives. Proved developed production represents production from existing wells. Market Resources does not enter into derivative arrangements for speculative purposes and does not hedge undeveloped reserves or equ ity NGL. Hedges are matched to equity gas and oil production, thus qualifying as cash flow hedges under the accounting provisions of SFAS 133 as amended and interpreted. Gas hedges are typically structured as fixed price swaps into regional pipelines, locking in basis and hedge effectiveness. Any ineffective portion of hedges is immediately recognized in the income statement. The ineffective portion of hedges was not significant in 2004 and 2003. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 74.3 bcf of forecast full year 2005 gas production was hedged at an average price of $4.90 per Mcf, net to the well. Market Resources enters into commodity price hedging arrangements with several banks and energy trading firms. Generally the contracts allow some amount of credit before Market Resources is required to deposit collateral for out of the money hedges. In some contracts the amount of credit varies depending on the credit rating assigned to Market Resources debt. Market Resources current ratings support individual counterparty lines of credit of $5 million to $40 million. If Market Resources credit ratings fall below investment grade (BBB by Standard & Poors or Baa3 by Moodys), counterparty credit generally falls to zero. In addition to the counterparty arrangements, Market Resources has a $200 million revolving credit facility in place with banks. A summary of Market Resources hedging positions for equity production as of December 31, 2004, is shown below. Prices are net to the well. Currently all hedges are fixed price swaps with creditworthy counterparties, allowing Market Resources to achieve a known price for a specific volume of production delivered into a regional sales point. The swap price is then reduced by gathering costs and adjusted for product quality to determine the net to the well price. # Rocky Rocky Time periods Mountains Midcontinent Total Mountains Midcontinent Total Gas (in bcf) Average price per Mcf, net to the well First half of 2005 24.0 13.7 37.7 $4.73 $5.33 $4.95 Second half of 2005 23.6 13.0 36.6 4.65 5.23 4.86 12 months of 2005 47.6 26.7 74.3 4.69 5.28 4.90 First half of 2006 12.2 3.4 15.6 $4.96 $5.55 $5.09 Second half of 2006 12.4 3.5 15.9 4.96 5.55 5.09 12 months of 2006 24.6 6.9 31.5 4.96 5.55 5.09 First half of 2007 1.7 1.7 $5.08 $5.08 Second half of 2007 1.7 1.7 5.08 5.08 12 months 2007 3.4 3.4 5.08 5.08 Oil (in Mbbl) Average price per bbl, net to the well First half of 2005 362 181 543 $33.41 $34.70 $33.84 Second half of 2005 368 184 552 33.41 34.70 33.84 12 months of 2005 730 365 1,095 33.41 34.70 33.84 Market Resources held gas price hedging contracts covering the price exposure for about 135.6 MMdth of gas, 1.1 MMbbl of oil and 3.8 MMgal of NGL as of December 31, 2004.
