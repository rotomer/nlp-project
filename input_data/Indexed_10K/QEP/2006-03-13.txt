ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION. SUMMARY Market Resources net income increased 56% in 2005 compared to 2004 and 43% in 2004 over 2003. Primary factors for the higher income were increases in production, higher realized natural gas, oil and NGL prices, increased gas gathering and processing volumes and margins, and additions to Wexpros investment base. The cumulative effect of implementing SFAS 143, an accounting rule governing the treatment of retirement costs of long lived assets, reduced Market Resources 2003 earnings by $5.1 million. Following is a comparison of net income by line of business: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Change 2005 v. 2004 Change 2004 v. 2003 (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) NET INCOME (LOSS) Questar E&P $172,788 $108,158 $70,403 $64,630 $37,755 Wexpro 43,669 35,303 32,642 8,366 2,661 Gas Management 35,699 21,047 13,333 14,652 7,714 Energy Trading 6,081 903 (388) 5,178 1,291 Total $258,237 $165,411 $115,990 $92,826 $49,421 RESULTS OF OPERATION Market Resources operates through four principal subsidiaries. Questar E&P acquires, explores for, develops and produces natural gas, oil, and NGL; Wexpro manages, develops and produces cost of service reserves for affiliated company, Questar Gas; Gas Management provides midstream field services including natural gas gathering and processing services for affiliates and third parties; and Energy Trading markets equity and third party gas and oil, provides risk management services, and through its wholly owned limited liability company, Clear Creek Storage Company, LLC, owns and operates an underground natural gas storage reservoir. Consolidated Results Market Resources net income for 2005 was $258.2 million compared with $165.4 million in 2004, a 56% increase, and $116.0 million in 2003. Operating income increased $148.7 million, or 54%, in the year to year comparison due to higher commodity prices and increased natural gas production at Questar E&P, an increased investment base at Wexpro, and increased NGL volumes coupled with improved gas gathering and processing margins at Gas Management. Following is a summary of Market Resources financial and operating results: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands) OPERATING INCOME Revenues Natural gas sales $ 517,603 $ 375,220 $285,118 Oil and NGL sales 118,633 86,336 67,020 Cost of service gas operations 133,204 116,747 100,997 Energy marketing 902,761 506,565 332,927 Gas gathering, processing and other 155,973 100,413 82,946 Total revenues 1,828,174 1,185,281 869,008 Operating expenses Energy purchases 888,253 499,726 327,401 Operating and maintenance 158,525 113,772 101,642 Production and other taxes 102,200 73,243 53,343 General and administrative 54,584 49,607 44,113 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 173,770 142,688 121,316 Exploration 11,538 9,239 4,498 Abandonment and impairment of gas, oil and other related properties 7,931 15,758 4,151 Wexpro Agreement oil income sharing 6,139 4,702 2,199 Total operating expenses 1,402,940 908,735 658,663 Operating income $ 425,234 $ 276,546 $210,345 OPERATING STATISTICS Questar E&P production volumes Natural gas (MMcf) 99,959 89,801 78,811 Oil and natural gas liquids (Mbbl) 2,375 2,281 2,324 Total production (Bcfe) 114.2 103.5 92.8 Average daily production (MMcfe) 313 283 254 Average commodity prices, net to the well Average realized price (including hedges) Natural gas (per Mcf) $5.18 $4.18 $3.62 Oil and NGL (per bbl) $41.54 $30.97 $23.39 Average sales price (excluding hedges) Natural gas (per Mcf) $6.92 $5.11 $4.17 Oil and NGL (per bbl) $51.97 $38.10 $28.47 Wexpro net investment base at December 31, net of depreciation and deferred income taxes (millions) $206.3 $182.8 $172.8 Natural gas gathering volumes (thousands of MMBtu) For unaffiliated customers 144,978 128,721 114,774 For Questar Gas 43,083 38,997 41,568 For other affiliated customers 68,903 56,958 46,150 Total gathering 256,964 224,676 202,492 Gathering revenue (per MMBtu) $0.25 $0.22 $0.20 Natural gas and oil marketing volumes (Mdthe) For unaffiliated customers 118,499 91,188 76,352 For affiliated customers 91,751 82,526 73,245 Total marketing 210,250 173,714 149,597 Questar E&P Questar E&P net income increased 60% to $172.8 million in 2005 compared with $108.2 million in 2004 and $70.4 million in 2003. The increases were driven by a combination of higher realized natural gas, oil and NGL prices and increased gas, oil and NGL production volumes. Questar E&Ps production increased to 114.2 Bcfe in 2005, a 10% increase compared to the year earlier period. Natural gas is Questar E&Ps primary focus. On an energy equivalent basis, natural gas comprised approximately 88% of Questar E&Ps production for 2005. A comparison of energy equivalent production by region is shown in the following table: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in Bcfe) Pinedale Anticline 33.2 23.5 15.2 Uinta Basin 25.6 24.8 29.0 Rockies Legacy 16.7 18.0 16.7 Rocky Mountain total 75.5 66.3 60.9 Midcontinent 38.7 37.2 31.9 Total Questar E&P production 114.2 103.5 92.8 Questar E&P production from the Pinedale Anticline in western Wyoming increased 41% In 2005 and comprised 29% of Questar E&P total production for the year. Questar E&P completed 40 new wells at Pinedale during 2005. In the Uinta Basin of eastern Utah, Questar E&P production increased 3% to 25.6 Bcfe in 2005 compared to 24.8 Bcfe a year ago despite production constraints related to third quarter construction and maintenance on an interstate pipeline that serves the area. Production from Questar E&Ps Rockies Legacy properties in 2005 was 16.7 Bcfe compared to 18.0 Bcfe during the 2004 period, a 7% decrease. Legacy properties include all of Questar E&Ps Rocky Mountain producing properties other than Pinedale and the Uinta Basin. Production during the 2005 period was negatively impacted by normal field decline, seasonal restrictions that limit access to leases and wells during the winter months, payout of a high volume well that reduced the Companys working interest and mechanical problems that delayed completion of a new well in the Vermillion Basin. Midcontinent production was 38.7 Bcfe in 2005 compared to 37.2 Bcfe for the same period of 2004, a 4% increase. The Company continued one rig development programs in both the Hartshorne coalbed methane development project in the Arkoma Basin of eastern Oklahoma and the ongoing infill development drilling on the Elm Grove properties in northwest Louisiana. Questar E&P also benefited from higher realized prices for natural gas, oil and NGL. In 2005 the weighted average realized natural gas price for Questar E&P (including the effects of hedging) was $5.18 per Mcf compared to $4.18 per Mcf in 2004, a 24% increase. Realized oil and NGL prices for 2005 averaged $41.54 per bbl compared with $30.97 per bbl during the prior year period, a 34% increase. A comparison of average realized prices by region, including hedges, is shown in the following table: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Natural gas (per Mcf) Rocky Mountains $5.01 $3.95 $3.27 Midcontinent 5.49 4.57 4.26 Volume weighted average 5.18 4.18 3.62 Oil and NGL (per bbl) Rocky Mountains $42.08 $30.10 $21.95 Midcontinent 40.25 32.98 27.04 Volume weighted average 41.54 30.97 23.39 Approximately 83% of Questar E&Ps gas production in 2005 was hedged or pre sold compared to 76% in 2004. Hedging reduced gas revenues $173.9 million in 2005 and $83.9 million in 2004. Questar E&P also hedged or pre sold approximately 70% of its 2005 oil production and 66% of its 2004 production. Oil hedges reduced revenues $24.8 million in 2005 and $16.3 million in 2004. The Company may hedge up to 100 percent of its forecasted production from proved reserves to lock in acceptable returns on invested capital and to protect cash flow and earnings from a decline in commodity prices. During 2005, Questar E&P continued to take advantage of high natural gas and oil prices to add to hedge additional production in 2006, 2007 and 2008. Natural gas and oil hedges as of December 31, 2005, are summarized in Item 7A of Part I of this Annual Report. Questar E&Ps controllable production cost structure per unit of production (the sum of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, lease operating expense, general and administrative expense and allocated interest expense) increased 9% to $2.23 per Mcfe in 2005 versus $2.05 per Mcfe in 2004 and $1.99 per Mcfe in 2003. Questar E&Ps controllable production cost structure is summarized in the following table: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (per Mcfe) Depreciation, depletion and amortization $1.18 $1.04 $0.98 Lease operating expense 0.54 0.50 0.49 General and administrative expense 0.30 0.30 0.29 Allocated interest expense 0.21 0.21 0.23 Total controllable production costs $2.23 $2.05 $1.99 Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense rose 13% in 2005 to $1.18 per Mcfe due to the ongoing depletion of older, lower cost reserves, reserve revisions for the companys Uinta Basin properties and higher reserve replacement (finding and development) costs. Higher day rates for rigs and other services in core operating areas, along with sharply higher steel prices, resulted in higher drilling and completion costs. Production taxes per Mcfe produced were $0.60, $0.46 and $0.34 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Increased production taxes were driven by higher gas, oil and NGL sales prices. Most production taxes are based on a fixed percentage of commodity sales prices. Higher lease operating expenses reflect a general increase in well service costs, including costs of contracted services and production related supplies, increased workover and production enhancement projects and additional production related costs. Exploration expense increased $1.9 million in 2005 compared to the 2004. The expense increase was due to increased exploratory seismic acquisition expenditures in the Midcontinent and Uinta Basin. Questar E&P abandonment and impairment expense declined $5.3 million in 2005 compared to 2004. The 2004 amount included $2.3 million of expense due to a well with collapsed casing. Pinedale Anticline Drilling Activity As of December 31, 2005, Market Resources operated and had an interest in 144 producing wells on the Pinedale Anticline compared to 104 and 76 at year end 2004 and 2003, respectively. In August, 2005, the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (WOGCC) approved 10 acre density drilling for Lance Pool (combined Lance and Mesaverde formations) wells on about 12,700 acres of Market Resources 18,208 acre (gross) Pinedale leasehold. The area approved for increased density corresponds to the currently estimated productive limits of Market Resources core acreage in the field. On 10 acre density, the company has over 932 potential Lance Pool well locations at Pinedale. Of the 788 locations yet to be drilled, 203 were booked as proved undeveloped at year end, leaving over 585 locations unbooked. Questar E&P has an average Lance Pool working interest of 59.4% and an average net revenue interest of 47.5% in 87 3 of the 932 locations. Wexpro has an average Lance Pool working interest of 51.3% in 215 of the 932 locations, resulting in a combined average Lance Pool working interest for Questar E&P and Wexpro of 67.5% in the 932 locations. On August 19, 2005, Questar E&P reached a total depth of 19,520 feet in the Hilliard Shale at the Stewart Point 15 29 exploratory well. Based on log information and gas shows, Questar E&P identified multiple zones of interest below the Lance Pool at depths from about 16,000 to 19,500 feet, ran casing to total depth and in mid September commenced hydraulic stimulation and testing. Starting in the lower part of the well, the company pumped three frac stages over a 900 foot interval from 18,541 to 19,434 feet and began flowing the well back to sales on an 18/64 inch choke. During initial flowback, the company measured extrapolated flow rates as high as 10.7 MMcf per day of dry, sweet gas with 10,000 to 12,000 psig flowing casing pressure and an extrapolated rate of about 2,400 barrels per day of frac water. As the flowback continued, the well exhibited steadily declining rates and pressures and, on sev eral occasions, had to be shut in to remove debris plugging the choke. Eventually a combination of very small pieces of shale from the formation, proppant used in the fracs, and chunks of the flow through frac plugs used to isolate individual stages partially filled the wellbore, blocking the flow of gas to the surface. The vertical extent of the obstruction is currently unknown. Given the very high formation pressures, specialized equipment (a high pressure snubbing unit) and experienced personnel are required to attempt to circulate out the obstruction inside the wellbore and either reestablish production from the initial test interval, or isolate that interval and move up hole to test additional zones. The Company was not able to secure the right snubbing unit and crew for this operation before cold winter weather would make this operation technically and operationally risky. The resumption of testing of the well will be delayed until the spring of 2006. Uinta Basin During 2005, the company drilled or participated in ten horizontal Green River formation oil wells, 54 Wasatch and Upper Mesaverde gas wells, and five deeper Blackhawk and Mancos formation gas wells on its core acreage block. In December, 2005 Questar E&P completed the Wolf Flat 1P 1 15 19 well, the first well drilled under an Exploration and Development Agreement (EDA) with the Ute Indian Tribe covering 12,557 acres of tribal minerals in the southern Uinta Basin. Questar E&P has a 50% working interest in the Wolf Flat well. The Company also completed acquisition of a 2 D seismic survey covering a portion of the EDA lands and exercised its option to acquire leases on all of the EDA lands. The Ute Indian Tribe has the option to participate in the first well drilled in each section with up to a 50% working interest. On December 31, 2005, the companys second 100% working interest test well in the Flat Rock prospect located one mile north of the Wolf Flat well, the FR 1P 36 14 19 well, was waiting on completion. Rockies Legacy In the Vermillion Basin on the southwestern Wyoming northwestern Colorado border, Market Resources continues to evaluate the potential of several formations at depths of 10,000 to 15,000 feet under the companys 143,000 net leasehold acres. As of December 31, 2005, the company had recompleted two older wells, drilled and completed three new wells and was drilling one well, the Canyon Creek 47. The first new well, Alkali Gulch Unit Well No 1, was completed in June 2005 and produced an average of 1.68 MMcf per day from the Baxter, Frontier and Dakota formations during the first 206 days. On December 31, 2005, the well was producing about 1.05 MMcf per day. The second new well, Canyon Creek 41, went to sales on September 21, 2005. During the first 102 days of production, the well averaged about 2.0 MMcf per day from the Baxter and Frontier formations. The well was producing about 1.1 MMcf per day on Decem ber 31, 2005. After delays related to mechanical problems, the third new well, Hiawatha Deep Unit No. 5, was completed and turned to sales in mid November, 2005. During the first 46 days of production, the well averaged 1.2 MMcf per day from the Baxter, Frontier and Dakota formations and was producing about .9 MMcf per day on December 31, 2005. The Company currently plans to drill about 12 new wells in the Vermillion Basin during 2006 and has initiated the process with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for a new Environmental Impact Statement covering the potential development of the deeper objectives. Midcontinent During 2005, the company continued one rig development programs at both the Hartshorne coalbed methane project in the Arkoma Basin of eastern Oklahoma and the infill development drilling project in the Elm Grove properties in northwestern Louisiana. The company drilled or participated in 38 new Hartshorne wells in 2005. In the Elm Grove area, the Company drilled or participated in 31 new wells in 2005 and estimates that it has a remaining inventory of about 108 locations. Wexpro Wexpros 2005 net income was $43.7 million compared with $35.3 million in 2004 and $32.6 million in 2003. Wexpro develops and produces gas reserves on behalf of affiliate Questar Gas. Pursuant to the Wexpro Agreement, Wexpro recovers its costs and receives an unlevered after tax return of approximately 19% on its investment in commercial wells and related facilities adjusted for working capital and reduced for deferred income taxes and depreciation investment base. Wexpro invested $57.8 million, boosting its investment base 13% to $206.3 million at December 31, 2005, up $23.5 million over the year earlier. Wexpros 2005 net income also benefited from 35% higher realized oil and NGL prices. Gas Management Gas Management net income increased 70% to $35.7 million in 2005 from $21.0 million in 2004 and $13.3 million in 2003. Gross keep whole processing margins (revenue from the sale of extracted NGLs less the cost of natural gas to replace the Btu equivalent of extracted NGL volumes) grew 22% from $14.2 million in 2004 to $17.4 million in 2005. The first quarter 2005 acquisition of a gas plant in western Wyoming drove a 59% increase in extracted NGL volumes in 2005 versus the year earlier. Gathering volumes increased 32.3 million MMBtu to 257.0 million MMBtu in 2005 due primarily to expanding Pinedale production and new projects serving third parties in the Uinta Basin. To reduce processing margin risk, Gas Management has restructured a number of its processing agreements with producers from keep whole contracts to fee based contracts. (A keep whole contract protects producers from frac spread risk, while fee based contracts eliminate commodity price risk for the plant owner.) To further reduce margin volatility associated with keep whole contracts, Gas Management began managing NGL price risk in 2004 by using forward sales contracts. In 2005 keep whole contracts benefited from a 19% increase in NGL sales prices versus the prior year. Fee based contracts benefited from a $0.02 increase in the rate charged per MMBtu processed in 2005. Forward sales contracts decreased NGL revenues by $1.0 million in 2005. Earnings before tax from Gas Managements 50% interest in Rendezvous increased to $7.2 million in 2005 versus $5.0 million for 2004, a 45% increase. Earnings growth in Rendezvous was driven by increased gathering volumes. Rendezvous provides gas gathering services for the Pinedale and Jonah producing areas. Gas Management continues to invest in additional gas gathering and processing and liquids handling facilities to serve growing equity and third party production in its core areas of the Pinedale and Jonah fields in western Wyoming and the Uinta Basin in eastern Utah. During the first quarter of 2005, Gas Management acquired a cryogenic gas processing facility located approximately 13 miles south of Gas Managements Blacks Fork plant, adding approximately 60 MMcf per day of raw gas processing and NGL extraction capacity at its western Wyoming hub. The plant has been connected to the Blacks Fork/Granger complex to significantly enhance processing and blending capacity for Pinedale, Jonah and other western Wyoming producers served by Gas Management and Rendezvous. Gas Management completed its condensate and produced water gathering and transportation facilities on Market Resources Pinedale Anticline leasehold in November 2005 in time to satisfy BLM conditions for expanded winter access. These new facilities will eliminate over 25,500 tanker truck trips per year at peak production from Market Resources operated acreage and the related air emissions, dust, noise, visual and traffic impacts. Gas Management entered into an agreement with a third party producer to gather, compress and process gas in the Uinta Basin. Under terms of the fee based agreement, the company constructed gas compression facilities and expanded its existing Red Wash gas plant to process an additional 70 MMcf per day of raw gas. The processed gas and liquids are redelivered to the producer. The new facilities were in service at the end of the third quarter 2005. Gas Management has also signed a letter of intent to form a joint venture with the Ute Indian Tribe and another industry participant to build a gas gathering system for the Flat Rock area in southern Uinta Basin. Energy Trading Energy Tradings net income for 2005 was $6.0 million compared to $0.9 million in 2004 and a loss of $0.4 million in 2003. Gross margins for gas and oil marketing (gross revenues less costs for gas and oil purchases, transportation and gas storage) increased to $14.5 million in 2005 versus $6.8 million a year ago, a 113% increase. The increase in gross margin was due primarily to a 77% higher unit margin and a 21% increase in volumes (includes both equity and third party) over the same period last year. INVESTING ACTIVITIES Capital spending in 2005 amounted $573.1 million. The details of capital expenditures in 2005 and 2004 and a forecast for 2006 are shown in the table below: Year Ended December 31, 2006 Forecast 2005 2004 (in thousands) Market Resources Drilling and other exploration $ 22,800 $ 51,671 $ 29,229 Development drilling 331,600 355,116 222,455 Wexpro development drilling 62,900 53,652 39,184 Reserve acquisitions 3,497 1,131 Production 15,800 24,817 13,640 Gathering and processing 52,000 96,733 26,979 Storage 545 1,171 General 5,300 2,881 12,040 490,400 588,912 345,829 Capital expenditure accruals (15,806) (13,023) Total capital expenditures $490,400 $573,106 $332,806 Market Resources expanded Rockies, Uinta Basin and Midcontinent drilling programs and construction of the water and condensate gathering system to serve the Pinedale Anticline represented the majority of the increase in capital expenditures for 2005 compared to 2004. Completion of the water and condensate gathering system in 2005 is the primary reason for the decrease in forecast 2006 capital expenditures. In 2005 Market Resources increased drilling activity at Pinedale and in the Midcontinent region. During 2005 Market Resources participated in 501 wells (180.2 net), resulting in 171.3 net successful gas and oil wells and 8.9 net dry or abandoned wells. The net drilling success rate was 95.1% in 2005. There were 103 gross wells in progress at year end. Market Resources also increased investment in its midstream gathering and processing services business to expand capacity in both western Wyoming and eastern Utah in response to growing equity and third party production volumes. CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS In the course of ordinary business activities, Market Resources enters into a variety of contractual cash obligations and other commitments. The following table summarizes the significant contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2005: Payments Due by Year Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After 2010 (in millions) Long term debt $350.0 $200.0 $150.0 Transportation and storage contracts 53.0 $6.9 13.5 $10.8 21.8 Operating leases 9.9 2.3 3.7 2.1 1.8 Total $412.9 $9.2 $217.2 $12.9 $173.6 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Market Resources significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 accompanying the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report. The Companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported results of operations and financial position. The following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment on the part of management. Successful Efforts Accounting for Gas and Oil Operations The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for gas and oil property acquisitions, exploration, development and production activities. Under this method, the acquisition costs of proved and unproved properties, successful exploratory wells and development wells are capitalized. Other exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs, the delay rental and administrative costs associated with unproved property and unsuccessful exploratory well costs, are expensed. Costs to operate and maintain wells and field equipment are expensed as incurred. The capitalized costs of unproved properties are generally combined and amortized over the expected holding period for such properties. Individually significant unproved properties are periodically reviewed for impairment. Capitalized costs of unproved properties are reclassified as proved property when related proved reserves are determined or charged against the impairment allowance when abandoned. Capitalized proved property acquisition costs are amortized by field using the unit of production method based on proved reserves. Capitalized exploratory well and development costs are amortized similarly by field based on proved developed reserves. The calculation takes into consideration estimated future equipment dismantlement, surface restoration and property abandonment costs, net of estimated equipment salvage values. Other property and equipment are generally depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives or the unit of production method for certain processing plants. A gain or loss is generally recognized only when an entire field is sold or abandoned, or if the unit of production amortization rate would be significantly affected. Questar E&P engages independent reservoir engineering consultants to prepare estimates of the proved gas and oil reserves. Reserve estimates are based on a complex and highly interpretive process that is subject to continuous revision as additional production and development drilling information becomes available. Long lived assets are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated on a field by field basis. If the undiscounted pretax cash flows are less than the net book value of the asset group, the asset value is written down to estimated fair value, which is determined using discounted future net revenues. Accounting for Derivatives The Company uses derivative instruments, typically fixed price swaps, to hedge against a decline in the realized prices of its gas and oil production. Accounting rules for derivatives require that these instruments be marked to fair value at the balance sheet reporting date. The change in fair value is reported either in net income or comprehensive income depending on the structure of the derivatives. The Company has structured virtually all energy derivative instruments as cash flow hedges as defined in SFAS 133 as amended. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded on the balance sheet and in comprehensive income or loss until the underlying gas or oil is produced. When a derivative is terminated before its contract expires, the associated gain or loss is recognized in income over the life of the previously hedged production. Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized in the period that services are provided or products are delivered. Questar E&P uses the sales method of accounting whereby revenue is recognized as gas, oil and NGL is sold to purchasers. Revenues include estimates for the two most recent months using published commodity index prices and volumes supplied by field operators. Revenues also reflect the impact of price hedging instruments. A liability is recorded to the extent that Questar E&P has sold volumes in excess of its share of remaining gas and oil reserves in an underlying property. Energy Trading gas and oil marketing revenues are presented on a gross revenue basis. Recent Accounting Developments Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for a discussion of recent accounting developments. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Market Resources primary market risk exposures arise from commodity price changes for natural gas, oil and NGL, estimation of gas and oil reserves and volatility in interest rates. Energy Trading has long term contracts for pipeline capacity and is obligated for transportation services with no guarantee that it will be able to recover the full cost of these transportation commitments. Commodity Price Risk Management Market Resources bears the risk associated with commodity price changes and uses gas and oil price hedging arrangements in the normal course of business to limit the risk of adverse price movements. However these same arrangements typically limit future gains from favorable price movements. Hedging contracts are used for a significant share of Questar E&P owned gas and oil production and for a portion of gas and oil marketing transactions and for some of Gas Managements NGL. Market Resources has established policies and procedures for managing commodity price risks through the use of derivatives. Natural gas and oil price hedging supports Market Resources rate of return and cash flow targets and protects earnings from downward movements in commodity prices. The volume of hedged production and the mix of derivative instruments are regularly evaluated and adjusted by management in response to changing market conditions and reviewed periodically by the Finance and Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. Market Resources may hedge up to 100% of forecast production from proved reserves when prices meet earnings and cash flow objectives. Market Resources does not enter into derivative arrangements for speculative purposes and does not hedge undeveloped reserves or equity NGL. Hedges are matched to equity gas and oil production, thus qualifying as cash flow hedges under the accounting provisions of SFAS 133 as amended and interpreted. Gas hedges are typically structured as fixed price swaps into regional pipelines, locking in basis and hedge effectiveness. Any ineffective portion of hedges is immediately recognized in income. The ineffective portion of hedges was not significant in 2005 and 2004. As of December 31, 2005, approximately 142.8 Bcf of forecast gas production for 2006, 2007 and 2008 was hedged at an estimated average price of $6.62 per Mcf, net to the well (which reflects assumed adjustments for regional basis, gathering and processing costs and gas quality). The Company enters into commodity price hedging arrangements with creditworthy counterparties (banks and industry participants) with a variety of credit requirements. Some contracts do not require the Company to post cash collateral, while others allow some amount of credit before requiring deposits of collateral for out of the money hedges. The amount of credit available may vary depending on the credit rating assigned to the Companys debt securities. A substantial increase in the price of natural gas, oil and or NGL could result in the requirement to deposit large amounts of collateral with counterparties that could seriously impact the Companys cash liquidity. Additionally a downgrade in the Companys credit ratings to sub investment grade could result in the acceleration of obligations to hedge counterparties. In addition to the counterparty arrangements, Market Resources has a $200 mil lion long term revolving credit facility with banks that was not utilized at December 31, 2005. A summary of Market Resources hedging positions for equity production as of December 31, 2005, is shown below. Prices are net to the well. Currently all hedges are fixed price swaps with creditworthy counterparties, allowing Market Resources to achieve a known price for a specific volume of production delivered into a regional sales point. The swap price is then reduced by gathering costs and adjusted for product quality to determine the net to the well price.
