ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION. SUMMARY Market Resources net income increased 38% in 2006 compared to 2005 and 56% in 2005 over 2004. Primary factors for the higher income were increases in natural gas production, higher realized natural gas, oil and NGL prices, higher gas processing and gas gathering margins, and increases in the Wexpro investment base. Year Ended December 31 Change Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 v. 2005 2005 v. 2004 (in millions, except per share amounts) NET INCOME Questar E&P $253.9 $172.8 $108.2 $81.1 $64.6 Wexpro 50.0 43.7 35.3 6.3 8.4 Gas Management 42.6 35.7 21.0 6.9 14.7 Energy Trading 9.6 6.0 0.9 3.6 5.1 Market Resources total $356.1 $258.2 $165.4 $97.9 $92.8 RESULTS OF OPERATION Market Resources operates through four principal subsidiaries. Questar E&P acquires, explores for, develops and produces natural gas, oil, and NGL; Wexpro manages, develops and produces cost of service reserves for affiliated company, Questar Gas; QUESTAR MARKET RESOURCES 2006 FORM 10 K 19 Gas Management provides midstream field services including natural gas gathering and processing services for affiliates and third parties; and Energy Trading markets equity and third party gas and oil, provides risk management services, and through its wholly owned limited liability company, Clear Creek Storage Company, LLC, owns and operates an underground natural gas storage reservoir. Consolidated Results Market Resources reported $356.1 million of net income for 2006 compared with $258.2 million in 2005, a 38% increase, and $165.4 million in 2004. Operating income increased $160.8 million, or 38%, in the 2006 to 2005 comparison due primarily to increased natural gas production and higher realized prices at Questar E&P, an increased investment base at Wexpro, increased gas processing plant margins at Gas Management and a net gain from asset sales.

The increase was driven by a combination of higher realized natural gas, oil and NGL prices and increased gas, oil and NGL production volumes. Questar E&P reported production volumes increased to 129.6 Bcfe in 2006, a 13% increase compared to 2005. Natural gas is Questar E&Ps primary focus. On an energy equivalent basis, natural gas comprised approximately 88% of Questar E&P 2006 production. A comparison of natural gas equivalent production by region is shown in the following table: Year Ended December 31, Change Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 (in Bcfe) Pinedale Anticline 39.5 33.2 23.5 6.3 9.7 Uinta Basin 25.1 25.6 24.8 (0.5) 0.8 Rockies Legacy 18.3 16.7 18.0 1.6 (1.3) Rocky Mountain total 82.9 75.5 66.3 7.4 9.2 Midcontinent 46.7 38.7 37.2 8.0 1.5 Total Questar E&P 129.6 114.2 103.5 15.4 10.7 Questar E&P production from the Pinedale Anticline in western Wyoming grew 19% to 39.5 Bcfe in 2006 and comprised 30% of Questar E&P total production in the 2006 period compared to 33.2 Bcfe and 29% of 2005 production. Questar E&P completed 51 new wells during 2006 and 40 new wells at Pinedale during 2005. In the Uinta Basin of eastern Utah, Questar E&P production decreased 2% to 25.1 Bcfe in 2006 compared to a year ago. Production increased 3% to 25.6 Bcfe in 2005 compared to 24.8 Bcfe in 2004 despite production constraints related to third quarter construction and maintenance on an interstate pipeline. Production from Questar E&P Rocky Mountain Legacy properties increased 10% to 18.3 Bcfe in 2006 compared to a year ago. Excluding a one time adjustment of 0.7 Bcfe, Legacy 2006 production was 17.6 Bcfe, an increase of 5% over the 2005 period QUESTAR MARKET RESOURCES 2006 FORM 10 K 21 driven by the companys emerging gas play in the Vermillion Basin. Legacy assets include all Questar E&P Rocky Mountain region properties except the Pinedale Anticline and the Uinta Basin. Production during the 2005 period was negatively impacted by normal field decline, seasonal restrictions that limit access to leases and wells during the winter months, payout of a high volume well that reduced the companys working interest and mechanical problems that delayed completion of a new well in the Vermillion Basin. In the Midcontinent, production grew 21% to 46.7 Bcfe in 2006, driven by ongoing infill development drilling in the Elm Grove field in northwestern Louisiana. Questar E&P also benefited from higher realized prices for natural gas, oil and NGL. In 2006, the weighted average realized natural gas price for Questar E&P (including the impact of hedging) was $6.00 per Mcf compared to $5.18 per Mcf for the same period in 2005, a 16% increase. Realized oil and NGL prices in 2006 averaged $49.12 per bbl, compared with $41.54 per bbl during the prior year period, an 18% increase. A regional comparison of average realized prices including hedges is shown in the following table: Year Ended December 31, Change Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Natural gas (per Mcf) Rocky Mountains $5.73 $5.01 $3.95 $0.72 $1.06 Midcontinent 6.47 5.49 4.57 0.98 0.92 Volume weighted average 6.00 5.18 4.18 0.82 1.00 Oil and NGL (per bbl) Rocky Mountains $46.62 $42.08 $30.10 $4.54 $11.98 Midcontinent 54.93 40.25 32.98 14.68 7.27 Volume weighted average 49.12 41.54 30.97 7.58 10.57 Approximately 70% in 2006 and 83% in 2005 of Questar E&P gas production was hedged or pre sold. Hedging increased 2006 gas revenues by $53.7 million and reduced 2005 gas revenues by $173.9 million. Approximately 78% in 2006 and 70% in 2005 of Questar E&P oil production was hedged or pre sold. Oil hedges reduced revenues $19.6 million in 2006 and $24.8 million in 2005. Questar E&P may hedge up to 100 percent of forecasted production from proved reserves to lock in acceptable returns on invested capital and to protect returns, cash flow and net income from a decline in commodity prices. During 2006, Questar E&P continued to take advantage of high natural gas and oil prices to hedge additional production through 2008. In 2006, the company began using basis only swaps to protect cash flows and net income from widening natural gas price basis differentials that may result from capacity constraints on regional gas pipelines. Derivative positions as of December 31, 2006, are summarized in Part II of Item 7A of this Annual Report. Questar E&P production costs (the sum of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, lease operating expense, general and administrative expense, allocated interest expense and production taxes) per Mcfe of production increased 6% to $2.99 per Mcfe in 2006 versus $2.83 per Mcfe in 2005 and $2.51 in 2004. Questar E&P production costs are summarized in the following table: Year Ended December 31, Change Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 (per Mcfe) Depreciation, depletion and amortization $1.43 $1.18 $1.04 $0.25 $0.14 Lease operating expense 0.57 0.54 0.50 0.03 0.04 General and administrative expense 0.33 0.30 0.30 0.03 Allocated interest expense 0.21 0.21 0.21 Production taxes 0.45 0.60 0.46 (0.15) 0.14 Total production costs $2.99 $2.83 $2.51 $0.16 $0.32 QUESTAR MARKET RESOURCES 2006 FORM 10 K 22 Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense rose due to higher costs for drilling, completion and related services, increased cost of steel casing, other tubulars and wellhead equipment, and the ongoing depletion of older, lower cost reserves. Per unit lease operating expense increased due to increased costs of materials and consumables and higher well workover costs. General and administrative expenses increased due to higher labor costs and an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts. Production taxes per unit decreased with lower sales prices on natural gas, increased incentive tax credits related to well drilling and production enhancement projects, and adjustments to prior estimates. Most production taxes are based on a fixed percentage of commodity sales prices. Questar E&P exploration expense increased $23.3 million in 2006 compared to 2005. The increase was primarily due to expenses for unsuccessful exploratory wells. Questar E&P plugged and abandoned the deep exploratory portion of the Stewart Point 15 29 well on the Pinedale Anticline after failing to establish commercial production in the Hilliard and Rock Springs formations. The company recorded a $10.0 million charge related to abandonment of the deep portion of the well, which was subsequently re completed as a commercial well in the Lance Pool. Exploration expense increased $1.9 million in 2005 compared to 2004. The expense increase was due to increased exploratory seismic acquisition expenditures in the Midcontinent and Uinta Basin. Abandonment and impairment expense decreased $0.1 million in 2006 compared to 2005 and declined $5.3 million in 2005 compared to 2004. The 2004 amount included $2.3 million of expense due to a well with collapsed casing and $3.3 million for an aban doned coal bed methane project. In 2006, Questar E&P sold certain proved reserves and undeveloped leasehold interests in western Colorado and recognized a pre tax gain of $22.7 million. For income tax purposes, the company structured the sale of the Colorado properties and the 2006 acquisition of certain Louisiana properties to qualify as a reverse like kind exchange of property under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Pinedale Anticline Drilling Activity As of December 31, 2006, Market Resources (including both Questar E&P and Wexpro) operated and had working interest in 195 producing wells on the Pinedale Anticline compared to 144 and 104 at year end 2005 and 2004, respectively. Of the 195 producing wells, Questar E&P has working interests in 173 wells, overriding royalty interests only in an additional 21 Wexpro operated wells, and no interest in one well operated by Wexpro. Wexpro has working interests in 66 of the 195 producing wells. In 2005, the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission approved 10 acre density drilling for Lance Pool wells on about 12,700 acres of Market Resources 18,208 acre (gross) Pinedale leasehold. The area approved for increased density corresponds to the currently estimated productive limits of Market Resources core acreage in the field. With 10 acre density drilling, the company currently believes that up to 932 wells will be required to fully develop the Lance Pool on its acreage. Uinta Basin During 2006, the company drilled or participated in 65 Wasatch and Upper Mesaverde gas wells, four horizontal and one vertical Green River Formation oil wells, and four deeper Blackhawk, Mancos and Dakota formations gas wells on its core acreage block. As of December 31, 2006, Questar E&P had drilled five wells in the Flat Rock and Wolf Flat areas in the southern portion of the Uinta Basin, including two wells on its 12,577 gross acre Ute Tribe Exploration and Development Agreement lands and three wells on its State of Utah leasehold, and was drilling another well at year end. Rockies Legacy In the Vermillion Basin on the southwestern Wyoming northwestern Colorado state line, Market Resources continues to evaluate the potential of several formations under the companys 146,000 net leasehold acres. As of December 31, 2006, the company had recompleted two older wells, drilled and completed 13 new wells, and two were waiting on completion. The targets are the Baxter Shale, which extends across a 3,000 3,500 foot gross interval from about 9,500 feet deep to about 13,000 feet deep on most of the companys leasehold in the basin, and the deeper Frontier and Dakota tight sand formations at depths down to 14,000 feet. Midcontinent Questar E&P continued a two rig infill development project in the Elm Grove field in northwest Louisiana as it operated or participated in eight new wells that were completed in the fourth quarter of 2006. The company participated in the completion of 36 wells in Elm Grove field in 2006. In 2006, Questar E&P also acquired interests in 48 producing wells in nine spacing units in QUESTAR MARKET RESOURCES 2006 FORM 10 K 23 the Elm Grove field. The acquisition provides Questar E&P initial or additional working interest in approximately 75 undrilled locations. Wexpro Wexpro, a Market Resources subsidiary that develops and produces cost of service reserves for Questar Gas, reported net income of $50.0 million, in 2006 compared to $43.7 in 2005, a 14% increase and $35.3 million in 2004. Pursuant to the Wexpro Agreement, Wexpro recovers its costs and receives an unlevered after tax return of approximately 19% to 20% on its investment in commercial wells and related facilities adjusted for working capital and reduced for deferred income taxes and depreciation (investment base). Wexpro investment base at December 31, 2006, was $260.6 million, an increase of $54.3 million or 26%. Gas Management Gas Management, Market Resources gas gathering and processing services business, grew net income 19% to $42.6 million in 2006 from $35.7 million in 2005 and $21.0 million in 2004. Gas processing plant margin grew 72% from $24.3 million in 2005 to $41.7 million in 2006. Gathering volumes increased 17.1 million MMBtu to 274.1 million MMBtu in 2006 due primarily to expanding Pinedale production and new projects serving third parties in the Uinta Basin. Total gathering margins increased 9% despite increased start up costs associated with the Pinedale liquids gathering and transportation facilities. To reduce processing margin risk, Gas Management has restructured a number of its processing agreements with producers from keep whole contracts to fee based contracts. A keep whole contract protects producers from frac spread risk while fee based contracts eliminate commodity price risk for the plant owner. In 2006, revenues from keep whole contracts benefited from a 13% increase in realized NGL sales prices versus the prior year period. Revenues from fee based contracts were impacted by a 59% increase in processing volumes offset by a $0.01 decrease in the average rate charged per MMBtu processed compared with 2005. To further reduce margin volatility associated with keep whole contracts, Gas Management began managing NGL price risk in 2004 by using forward sales contracts. Forward sales contracts increased NGL revenues by $0.7 million in 2006 and decreased NGL revenues $1.0 million in 2005. Income before income tax from Gas Managements 50% interest in Rendezvous was $7.0 million for 2006 compared to $7.2 million in 2005 and $5.0 million in 2004. Rendezvous provides gas gathering services for the Pinedale and Jonah producing areas. Gas Management continues to invest in additional gas gathering and processing and liquids handling facilities to serve growing equity and third party production in its core areas of the Pinedale and Jonah fields in western Wyoming and the Uinta Basin in eastern Utah. Gas Management completed its condensate and produced water gathering and transportation facilities on Market Resources Pinedale Anticline leasehold in November 2005 in time to satisfy BLM conditions for expanded winter access. Gas Management entered into an agreement with a third party producer to gather, compress and process gas in the Uinta Basin. Under terms of the fee based agreement, the company constructed gas compression facilities and expanded its existing Red Wash gas plant to process an additional 70 MMcf per day of raw gas. The processed gas and liquids are redelivered to the producer. The new facilities were in service at the end of the third quarter 2005. Gas Management has formed a joint venture with the Ute Indian Tribe and another industry participant to build a gas gathering system for the Flat Rock area in southern Uinta Basin. Energy Trading and Other Energy Trading sells Market Resources equity gas and oil, provides risk management services and operates a natural gas storage facility, reported net income for 2006 of $9.6 million compared to $6.0 million in 2005 and $0.9 million in 2005. Service fee revenues from affiliates were $0.8 million higher in 2006 relative to 2005. Gross margins for gas and oil marketing (gross revenues less costs for gas and oil purchases, transportation and gas storage), increased to $16.0 million for 2006 versus $14.5 million a year ago, a 10% increase. The increase in gross margin was due primarily to a 5% increase in volumes and increased storage activity over the same period last year. Consolidated Results Before Net Income Net gain on asset sales During 2006, Questar E&P sold certain proved reserves and undeveloped leasehold interests in western Colorado and recognized a pre tax gain of $22.7 million. The gain is included in the Consolidated Statement of Income line item Net gain on asset sales. For income tax purposes, the Company structured the sale of the Colorado properties and the March 2006 acquisition of certain QUESTAR MARKET RESOURCES 2006 FORM 10 K 24 Louisiana properties to qualify as a reverse like kind exchange of property under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Income from unconsolidated affiliates Gas Management has a 50% interest in Rendezvous that provides gas gathering services for the Pinedale and Jonah producing areas of western Wyoming. Gas Managements share of Rendezvous earnings amounted to $7.0 million in 2006 compared to $7.2 million in 2005 and $5.0 million in 2004. Rendezvous gathering volumes increased 1% in 2006 compared to 2005 and 47% in 2005 compared to 2004. Interest expense and loss on early extinguishment of debt Interest expense rose in 2006 compared to 2005 due primarily to increased average debt levels and higher interest rates on short term debt outstanding in the early part of 2006. Market Resources recognized a $1.7 million pre tax loss in 2006 on the early extinguishment of its 7% Notes due 2007. Net mark to market loss on basis only swaps The Company uses basis only swaps to protect cash flows and net income from widening natural gas price basis differentials that may result from capacity constraints on regional gas pipelines. The Company recognized mark to market losses of $1.9 million on the NYMEX/Rockies basis only swaps in 2006. Investing Activities Capital spending in 2006 amounted $752.7 million. The details of capital expenditures in 2006 and 2005 and a forecast for 2007 are shown in the table below: Year Ended December 31, 2007 Forecast 2006 2005 (in millions) Drilling and other exploration $ 31.4 $ 13.6 $ 51.7 Dry exploratory well expenses 26.3 3.1 Development drilling 476.8 532.6 355.1 Wexpro development drilling 62.6 76.8 53.7 Reserve acquisitions 1.0 29.3 3.5 Production 14.2 22.7 24.8 Gathering and processing 108.5 80.4 96.7 Storage 0.2 1.1 0.5 General 5.1 5.6 2.9 Capital expenditure accruals (35.7) (15.8) Total $699.8 $752.7 $576.2 In 2006 and 2005, Market Resources increased drilling activity at Pinedale and in the Midcontinent region. A water and condensate gathering system to serve the Pinedale Anticline was constructed in 2005. During 2006, Market Resources participated in 570 wells (196.3 net), resulting in 186.5 net successful gas and oil wells and 9.8 net dry or abandoned wells. The 2006 net drilling success rate was 95%. There were 131 gross wells in progress at year end. Market Resources also increased investment in its midstream gathering and processing services business to expand capacity in both western Wyoming and eastern Utah in response to growing equity and third party production volumes. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commitments In the course of ordinary business activities, Market Resources enters into a variety of contractual cash obligations and other commitments. The following table summarizes the significant contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2006: QUESTAR MARKET RESOURCES 2006 FORM 10 K 25 Payments Due by Year Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 After 2011 (in millions) Long term debt $400.0 $150.0 $250.0 Transportation and storage contracts 61.1 $ 9.0 $15.8 14.1 22.2 Operating leases 7.0 3.5 2.6 0.9 Total $468.1 $12.5 $18.4 $165.0 $272.2 Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Assumptions Market Resources significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report. The Companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported results of operations and financial position. The following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment on the part of management. Gas and Oil Reserves Gas and oil reserve estimates require significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given field may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, production history, and economic assumptions relating to commodity prices, production costs, severance and other taxes, capital expenditures and remedial costs. The subjective decisions and variances in data for various fields make these estimates less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures. For 2006, revisions of reserve estimates, other than revisions related to Pinedale increased density, resulted in a 23.8 Bcfe decrease in Questar E&Ps proved reserves and a 21.5 Bcfe increase in cost of service proved reserves, representing approximately one percent and three percent of reported proved reserves, respectively, as of December 31, 2006 . Revisions associated with Pinedale increased density drilling added 170.4 Bcfe to Questar E&Ps estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2006, and 104.6 Bcfe of additional cost of service proved reserves. See Note 13 for more information on the Companys estimated proved reserves. Successful Efforts Accounting for Gas and Oil Operations The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for gas and oil property acquisitions, exploration, development and production activities. Under this method, the acquisition costs of proved and unproved properties, successful exploratory wells and development wells are capitalized. Other exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs, the delay rental and administrative costs associated with unproved property and unsuccessful exploratory well costs, are expensed. Costs to operate and maintain wells and field equipment are expensed as incurred. The capitalized costs of unproved properties are generally combined and amortized over the expected holding period for such properties. Individually significant unproved properties are periodically reviewed for impairment. Capitalized costs of unproved properties are reclassified as proved property when related proved reserves are determined or charged against the impairment allowance when abandoned. Capitalized proved property acquisition costs are amortized by field using the unit of production method based on proved reserves. Capitalized exploratory well and development costs are amortized similarly by field based on proved developed reserves. The calculation takes into consideration estimated future equipment dismantlement, surface restoration and property abandonment costs, net of estimated equipment salvage values. Other property and equipment are generally depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives or the unit of production method for certain processing plants. A gain or loss is generally recognized only when an entire field is sold or abandoned, or if the unit of production amortization rate would be significantly affected. Questar E&P engages independent reservoir engineering consultants to prepare estimates of the proved gas and oil reserves. Reserve estimates are based on a complex and highly interpretive process that is subject to continuous revision as additional production and development drilling information becomes available. QUESTAR MARKET RESOURCES 2006 FORM 10 K 26 Long lived assets are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated on a field by field basis. Impairment is indicated when a triggering event occurs and the sum of estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of the evaluated asset is less than the assets carrying value. The asset value is written down to estimated fair value, which is determined using discounted future net cash flows. Accounting for Derivatives Contracts The Company uses derivative contracts, typically fixed price swaps, to hedge against a decline in the realized prices of its gas and oil production. Accounting rules for derivatives require marking these instruments to fair value at the balance sheet reporting date. The change in fair value is reported either in net income or comprehensive income depending on the structure of the derivatives. The Company has structured virtually all energy derivative instruments as cash flow hedges as defined in SFAS 133 as amended. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded on the balance sheet and in comprehensive income or loss until the underlying gas or oil is produced. When a derivative is terminated before its contract expires, the associated gain or loss is recognized in income over the life of the previously hedged production. Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized in the period that services are provided or products are delivered. Questar E&P uses the sales method of accounting whereby revenue is recognized for all gas, oil and NGL sold to purchasers. Revenues include estimates for the two most recent months using published commodity index prices and volumes supplied by field operators. A liability is recorded to the extent that Questar E&P has an imbalance in excess of its share of remaining reserves in an underlying property. Energy Trading presents revenues on a gross revenue basis. Energy Trading does not engage in speculative hedging transactions, nor does it buy and sell energy contracts with the objective of generating profits on short term differences in prices. Recent Accounting Developments Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for a discussion of recent accounting developments. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Market Resources primary market risk exposures arise from commodity price changes for natural gas, oil and NGL, and volatility in interest rates. Energy Trading has long term contracts for pipeline capacity and is obligated for transportation services with no guarantee that it will be able to recover the full cost of these transportation commitments. Commodity Price Risk Management Market Resources bears the risk associated with commodity price changes and uses gas and oil price derivative arrangements in the normal course of business to limit the risk of adverse price movements. However these same arrangements typically limit future gains from favorable price movements. Derivative contracts are used for a significant share of Questar E&P owned gas and oil production, a portion of Energy Trading gas and oil marketing transactions and some of Gas Managements NGL. Market Resources has established policies and procedures for managing commodity price risks through the use of derivatives. Natural gas and oil price hedging support Market Resources rate of return and cash flow targets and protects earnings from downward movements in commodity prices. The volume of hedged production and the mix of derivative instruments are regularly evaluated and adjusted by management in response to changing market conditions and reviewed periodically by the Finance and Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. Market Resources may hedge up to 100% of forecast production from proved reserves when prices meet earnings and cash flow objectives. Market Resources does not enter into derivative arrangements for speculative purposes and does not hedge undeveloped reserves or Questar E&P equity NGL. Market Resources uses fixed price swaps to manage natural gas, oil and NGL price risk. A fixed price swap is a derivative instrument that exchanges or swaps the floating or daily price of a specified volume of natural gas, oil or NGL, over a specified period, for a fixed price for the specified volume over the same period. In the normal course of business, the Company sells its equity natural gas, oil and NGL production to third parties at first of the month or daily floating prices related to indices reported in industry publications. To reduce exposure to highly volatile daily and monthly commodity prices, the Company uses a derivative instrument that exchanges or swaps the floating or daily price of the commodity for a fixed price for the specified period (typically for periods of three months or longer). The Company enters into these transactions with banks and industry counterparties with investment grade credit ratin gs. Swap agreements do not require the physical transfer of gas between the parties at settlement. Swap transactions are settled monthly, in cash, with one party paying the other for the net difference in prices, multiplied by the relevant volume, for the settlement period. QUESTAR MARKET RESOURCES 2006 FORM 10 K 27 Generally derivative instruments are matched to equity gas and oil production, thus qualifying as cash flow hedges under the accounting provisions of SFAS 133 as amended and interpreted. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded on the balance sheet and in other comprehensive income or loss until the underlying gas or oil is produced. Gas hedges are typically structured as fixed price swaps into regional pipelines, locking in basis and hedge effectiveness. The ineffective portion of cash flow hedges is immediately recognized in the determination of net income. Market Resources also entered into natural gas basis only swaps in 2006 to manage the risk of a widening of basis differentials in the Rocky Mountains. These contracts are marked to market with any change in the valuation recognized in the determination of net income. Market Resources enters into commodity price derivative arrangements with several banks and energy trading firms with a variety of credit requirements. Some contracts do not require collateral deposits, while others allow some amount of credit before Market Resources is required to deposit collateral for out of the money contracts. The amount of credit available may vary depending on the credit rating assigned to Market Resources debt. In addition, to the counterparty arrangements, Market Resources has a $182 million long term revolving credit facility with banks with no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2006. A summary of Market Resources derivative positions for equity production as of December 31, 2006, is shown below. Currently fixed price and basis only swaps are with creditworthy counterparties. Fixed price swaps allow Market Resources to realize a known price for a specific volume of production delivered into a regional sales point. The fixed price swap price is then reduced by gathering costs and adjusted for product quality to determine the net to the well price.

Market Resources five largest customers are Sempra Energy Trading Corp., BP Energy Company, ONEOK Energy Services Company LP, Enterprise Products Operating and Nevada Power Company. Sales to these companies accounted for 27% of Market Resources revenues before elimination of intercompany transactions in 2006, and their accounts were current at December 31, 2006. Interest Rate Risk The fair value of fixed rate debt is subject to change as interest rates fluctuate. The Company had $400.0 million of fixed rate long term debt with a fair value of $412.8 million at December 31, 2006. A year earlier the Company had $350.0 million of fixed rate long term debt with a fair value of $368.5 million. If interest rates would have declined 10%, fair value would increase to $427.2 million in 2006 and $373.4 million in 2005. The fair value calculations do not represent the cost to retire the debt securities. QUESTAR MARKET RESOURCES 2006 FORM 10 K 30
