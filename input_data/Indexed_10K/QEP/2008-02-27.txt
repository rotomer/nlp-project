ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION. SUMMARY Market Resources net income increased 18% in 2007 compared to 2006 and 38% in 2006 over 2005. Primary due to higher realized natural gas, crude oil and NGL prices, increased gas gathering volumes driven by an increase in third party volumes at Gas Management and an increased investment base at Wexpro. Following is a comparison of net income by lines of business: Year Ended December 31, Change Change 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 (in millions, except per share amounts) Exploration and Production Questar E&P $285.5 $253.9 $172.8 $31.6 $ 81.1 Wexpro 59.2 50.0 43.7 9.2 6.3 Midstream Field Services Gas Management 55.3 42.6 35.7 12.7 6.9 Energy Marketing Energy Trading and other 20.8 9.6 6.0 11.2 3.6 Net income $420.8 $356.1 $258.2 $64.7 $97.9 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Exploration and Production Questar E&P Following is a summary of Questar E&P financial and operating results: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Operating Income Revenues Natural gas sales $ 788.2 $ 684.0 $ 517.6 Oil and NGL sales 164.2 128.6 98.6 Other 3.6 3.1 4.4 Total revenues 956.0 815.7 620.6 Operating expenses Operating and maintenance 87.9 73.6 61.8 General and administrative 56.3 42.4 33.9 Production and other taxes 60.1 58.3 68.7 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 243.5 185.7 134.7 Exploration 22.0 34.4 11.1 Abandonment and impairment 10.8 7.6 7.7 QUESTAR MARKET RESOURCES 2007 FORM 10 K 19 Natural gas purchases 2.2 2.8 4.2 Total operating expenses 482.8 404.8 322.1 et gain (loss) from asset sales (0.6) 24.3 1.1 Operating income $ 472.6 $ 435.2 $ 299.6 Operating Statistics Questar E&P production volumes Natural gas (Bcf) 121.9 113.9 100.0 Oil and NGL (MMbbl) 3.0 2.6 2.4 Total production (Bcfe) 140.2 129.6 114.2 Average daily production (MMcfe) 384.1 355.2 312.9 Questar E&P average realized price, net to the well (including hedges) Natural gas (per Mcf) $6.46 $6.00 $5.18 Oil and NGL (per bbl) $53.99 $49.12 $41.54 Questar E&P reported net income of $285.5 million in 2007, up 12% from $253.9 million in 2006 and $172.8 million in 2005. The impact of higher realized prices for natural gas, crude oil, and NGL was partially offset by a higher average production cost structure. Questar E&P production volumes were 140.2 Bcfe in 2007, compared to 129.6 Bcfe in the year earlier period. On an energy equivalent basis, natural gas comprised approximately 87% of Questar E&P 2007 production. A comparison of natural gas equivalent production by major operating area is shown in the following table: Year Ended December 31, Change Change 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 (in Bcfe) Pinedale Anticline 47.4 39.5 33.2 7.9 6.3 Uinta Basin 25.4 25.1 25.6 0.3 (0.5) Rockies Legacy 16.4 18.3 16.7 (1.9) 1.6 Rocky Mountain total(a) 89.2 82.9 75.5 6.3 7.4 Midcontinent 51.0 46.7 38.7 4.3 8.0 Total Questar E&P 140.2 129.6 114.2 10.6 15.4 (a)Questar E&P shut in approximately 10.3 Bcfe (net) of production in 2007 and 1.2 Bcfe (net) of production in 2006 in the Rocky Mountain region in response to low natural gas prices. Questar E&P production from the Pinedale Anticline in western Wyoming grew 20% to 47.4 Bcfe in 2007 as a result of ongoing development drilling. Pinedale production growth is influenced by seasonal access restrictions imposed by the Bureau of Land Management that limit the companys ability to drill and complete wells during the mid November to early May period. Questar E&P Rockies Legacy properties include all of the companys Rocky Mountain region properties except the Pinedale Anticline and the Uinta Basin. Rockies Legacy 2007 production of 16.4 Bcfe was 1.9 Bcfe lower than a year ago. In the Midcontinent, Questar E&P grew production 9% to 51.0 Bcfe in 2007, driven by ongoing infill development drilling in Elm Grove field in northwestern Louisiana. Net production from Elm Grove field increased to 16.4 Bcfe in 2007 compared to 14.3 Bcfe in the year earlier period. Questar E&P also benefited from higher realized prices for natural gas, oil and NGL. The weighted average realized natural gas price for Questar E&P (including the impact of hedging) was $6.46 per Mcf compared to $6.00 per Mcf for the same period in QUESTAR MARKET RESOURCES 2007 FORM 10 K 20 2006, an 8% increase. Realized oil and NGL prices in 2007 averaged $53.99 per bbl, compared with $49.12 per bbl during the prior year period, a 10% increase. A regional comparison of average realized prices, including hedges, is shown in the following table: Year Ended December 31, Change Change 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Natural gas (per Mcf) Rocky Mountains $5.92 $5.73 $5.01 $0.19 $0.72 Midcontinent 7.42 6.47 5.49 0.95 0.98 Volume weighted average 6.46 6.00 5.18 0.46 0.82 Oil and NGL (per bbl) Rocky Mountains $53.51 $46.62 $42.08 $6.89 $4.54 Midcontinent 54.85 54.93 40.25 (0.08) 14.68 Volume weighted average 53.99 49.12 41.54 4.87 7.58 Questar E&P hedged or pre sold approximately 75% of gas production in 2007, and hedged or pre sold 70% of gas production in the comparable 2006 period. Hedging increased Questar E&P gas revenues by $245.7 million in 2007 and $53.7 million in 2006. The company hedged or pre sold approximately 61% of its oil production in 2007, and hedged or pre sold 78% of its oil production in the same period of 2006. Oil hedges reduced revenues $17.2 million in 2007 and $19.6 million in 2006. Questar may hedge up to 100% of forecasted production from proved reserves to lock in acceptable returns on invested capital and to protect returns, cash flow and net income from a decline in commodity prices. During 2007, Questar E&P hedged additional production through 2010. In the second quarter of 2006, the company began using basis only swaps to protect cash flows and net income from widening natural gas price basis differentials that may result from capacity constraints on regional gas pipelines. Net mark to market changes in natural gas basis only swaps increased 2007 net income by $3.6 million compared to a $1.2 million reduction in the prior year period. Derivative positions as of December 31, 2007, are summarized in Item 7A of Part II in this annual report. Questar E&P production costs (the sum of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, lease operating expense, general and administrative expense, allocated interest expense and production taxes) per Mcfe of production increased 13% to $3.38 per Mcfe in 2007 compared to $2.99 per Mcfe in 2006. Questar E&P production costs are summarized in the following table: Year Ended December 31, Change Change 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 (per Mcfe) Depreciation, depletion and amortization $1.74 $1.43 $1.18 $0.31 $0.25 Lease operating expense 0.63 0.57 0.54 0.06 0.03 General and administrative expense 0.40 0.33 0.30 0.07 0.03 Allocated interest expense 0.18 0.21 0.21 (0.03) Production taxes 0.43 0.45 0.60 (0.02) (0.15) Total production costs $3.38 $2.99 $2.83 $0.39 $0.16 Production volume weighted average depreciation, depletion and amortization expense per Mcfe increased in 2007 due to higher costs for drilling, completion and related services, higher cost of steel casing, other tubulars and wellhead equipment, the ongoing depletion of older, lower cost reserves and the increasing component of Questar E&P production derived from higher cost fields such as Elm Grove in the Midcontinent and Vermillion Basin in the Rockies. Lease operating expense per Mcfe increased due to higher costs of materials and consumables, increased produced water disposal costs and higher well workover activity. General and administrative expense per Mcfe grew due to increased labor and legal expenses in 2007. Allocated interest expense per unit of production decreased in 2007 due to reduced debt expense and increased 2007 production. Production taxes were lower in 2007 due to lower market prices for natural gas. The company pays production taxes per Mcfe based on sales pric es before the impact of hedges. QUESTAR MARKET RESOURCES 2007 FORM 10 K 21 Questar E&P exploration expense decreased $12.4 million or 36% in 2007 compared to 2006. In 2006, Questar E&P recorded a $10.0 million charge related to the abandoned deep exploratory portion of the Stewart Point 15 29 well on the Pinedale Anticline after failing to establish commercial production in the Hilliard and Rock Springs formations. In 2006, Questar E&P sold certain proved reserves and undeveloped leasehold interests in western Colorado and recognized a pre tax gain of $22.7 million. Questar E&P major operating areas are discussed below. Pinedale Anticline: As of December 31, 2007, Market Resources (including both Questar E&P and Wexpro) operated and had working interests in 250 producing wells on the Pinedale Anticline compared to 195 a year earlier. Of the 250 producing wells, Questar E&P has working interests in 228 wells, overriding royalty interests in an additional 21 Wexpro operated wells, and no interest in one well operated by Wexpro. Wexpro has working interests in 71 of the 250 producing wells. In 2005, the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (WOGCC) approved 10 acre density drilling for Lance Pool wells on about 12,700 (gross) acres of Market Resources 18,208 acre (gross) Pinedale leasehold. The area approved for increased density corresponds to the currently estimated productive limits of Market Resources core acreage in the field. At December 31, 2007, Questar E&P had booked 355 proved undeveloped locations on a combination of 10 and 20 acre density and reported estimated net proved reserves at Pinedale of 1,033.9 Bcfe, or 55% of Questar E&Ps total proved reserves. The company is evaluating the economic potential of development on five acre density at Pinedale. In January 2008, the WOGCC approved five acre density drilling for Lance Pool wells on about 4,200 gross acres of Market Resources Pinedale leasehold. If five acre density development is appropriate for a majority of its leasehold, the company currently estimates up to an additional 1,600 wells will be required to fully develop the Lance Pool on its acreage. Uinta Basin: As of December 31, 2007, Questar E&P had a working interest in 857 producing wells in the Uinta Basin of eastern Utah, compared to 811 at December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2007, Questar E&P had booked 123 proved undeveloped locations and reported estimated net proved reserves in the Uinta Basin of 301.2 Bcfe or 16% of Questar E&Ps total proved reserves. Uinta Basin proved reserves are found in a series of vertically stacked, laterally discontinuous reservoirs at depths of 5,000 feet to deeper than 16,000 feet. Questar E&P owns interests in over 242,000 gross leasehold acres in the Uinta Basin. Rockies Legacy: The remainder of Questar E&P Rocky Mountain region leasehold interests, productive wells and proved reserves are distributed over a number of basins, fields and properties managed as the companys Rockies Legacy division. Most of the properties are located in the Greater Green River Basin of western Wyoming. In aggregate, Rockies Legacy properties comprised 158.6 Bcfe or 9% of Questar E&P total proved reserves at December 31, 2007. Within the division, exploratory and development activity is planned for 2008 within the San Juan, Paradox, Powder River, Green River and Vermillion basins. In the Vermillion Basin on the southwestern Wyoming northwestern Colorado state line, Market Resources companies continue to evaluate the potential of several formations under 146,000 net leasehold acres. As of December 31, 2007, Market Resources had recompleted two older wells and drilled and completed 20 new wells. The targets are the Baxter Shale, a thick, overpressured shale found at depths of about 9,500 to about 13,000 feet and deeper Frontier and Dakota tight sand formations at depths to about 14,000 feet. Midcontinent: Questar E&P Midcontinent properties are distributed over a large area, including the Anadarko basin of Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, the Arkoma basin of Oklahoma and western Arkansas, and the Ark La Tex region of Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas. With the exception of the Elm Grove field in northwest Louisiana and the Granite Wash play in the Texas Panhandle, Questar E&P Midcontinent leasehold interests are highly fragmented, with no significant concentration of property interests. Questar E&P reported Midcontinent proved reserves of 373.9 Bcfe on December 31, 2007, 20% of Questar E&Ps total year end proved reserves at December 31, 2007. Questar E&P continues a two rig infill development project on its largest single Midcontinent asset, the Elm Grove field in northwest Louisiana. As of December 31, 2007, Questar E&P operated or had working interests in 293 producing wells in the Elm Grove field compared to 231 at December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2007, Questar E&P had 38 proved undeveloped locations and reported estimated net proved reserves at Elm Grove of 104.6 Bcfe, or 6% of the companys total proved reserves. QUESTAR MARKET RESOURCES 2007 FORM 10 K 22 Wexpro Wexpro reported net income of $59.2 million in 2007 compared to $50.0 million in 2006, an 18% increase. Pursuant to the Wexpro Agreement, Wexpro recovers its costs and receives an unlevered after tax return of approximately 19% to 20% on its investment in commercial wells and related facilities adjusted for working capital and reduced for deferred income taxes and depreciation (investment base). Wexpro investment base at December 31, 2007, was $300.4 million, an increase of $39.8 million or 15% from December 31, 2006. Wexpro produced 34.9 Bcf of cost of service gas in 2007.

QUESTAR MARKET RESOURCES 2007 FORM 10 K 23 Gathering volumes increased 16.1 million MMBtu, or 6% to 290.2 million MMBtu in 2007. New projects serving third parties in the Uinta Basin and expanded Pinedale production contributed to a 31% increase in third party volumes during 2007. Total gathering margins (revenues minus direct expenses) during 2007 increased 35% to $67.1 million compared to $49.6 million in 2006. Fee based gas processing volumes were 126.6 million MMBtu in 2007, a 5% increase compared to the 2006 period. Fee based gas processing revenues increased 14% or $2.2 million, while gross margin from keep whole processing increased 40% or $12.9 million in 2007. Approximately 74% of Gas Management net operating revenue (total revenue less processing plant shrink) is derived from fee based contracts, compared to 77% in 2006. Gas Management uses forward sales contracts to reduce margin volatility associated with keep whole contracts. Forward sales contracts reduced NGL revenues by $5.8 million in 2007 and increased revenues by $0.7 million in 2006. Energy Marketing Questar Energy Trading Energy Trading grew net income 117% to $20.8 million in 2007 compared to $9.6 million in 2006, driven primarily by increased trading margins. Gross marketing margin (gross revenues less costs for gas and oil purchases, transportation and gas storage) totaled $31.6 million in 2007 compared to $16.0 million a year ago. The increase in trading margin was due primarily to increased storage activity over the same period last year. Energy Trading reported unaffiliated revenues of $504.4 million in 2007 compared with $656.0 million in 2006, a 23% decrease primarily resulting from lower regional market prices for natural gas. The weighted average natural gas sales price decreased 20% in 2007 to $4.29 per MMBtu, compared to $5.34 per MMBtu for the 2006 period. Consolidated Results Before Net Income Net gain (loss) from asset sales During 2006, Questar E&P sold certain proved reserves and undeveloped leasehold interests in western Colorado and recognized a pre tax gain of $22.7 million. The gain is included in the Consolidated Statement of Income line item Net gain (loss) from asset sales. Income from unconsolidated affiliates Income from unconsolidated affiliates, primarily Rendezvous Gas Services, was $8.9 million in 2007 compared to $7.5 million in 2006. Rendezvous Gas Services provides gas gathering services for the Pinedale and Jonah producing areas. Rendezvous gathering volumes increased 20% in 2007 compared to 2006 and 1% in 2006 compared to 2005. Interest expense and loss on early extinguishment of debt Interest expense was 5% higher in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of higher interest rates and increased borrowings. Interest expense rose in 2006 compared to 2005 due primarily to increased average debt levels and higher interest rates on short term debt outstanding in the early part of 2006. Market Resources recognized a $1.7 million pre tax loss in 2006 on the early extinguishment of its 7% Notes due 2007. Net mark to market gain (loss) on basis only swaps The Company uses basis only swaps to protect cash flows and net income from widening natural gas price basis differentials that may result from capacity constraints on regional gas pipelines. The Company recognized a net mark to market gain of $5.7 million on the natural gas basis only swaps in 2007 compared with a net mark to market loss of $1.9 million in 2006. Investing Activities Capital spending in 2007 amounted $943.9 million. The details of capital expenditures in 2007 and 2006 and a forecast for 2008 are shown in the table below: Year Ended December 31, 2008 Forecast 2007 2006 (in millions) Drilling and other exploration $ 76.7 $ 32.7 $ 13.6 Dry exploratory well expenses 12.3 26.3 Development drilling 779.4 612.0 532.6 Wexpro development drilling 125.7 97.2 76.8 QUESTAR MARKET RESOURCES 2007 FORM 10 K 24 Reserve acquisitions 643.9 44.8 29.3 Production 18.7 28.2 22.7 Midstream field services 389.1 125.7 80.4 Storage 0.2 0.3 1.1 General 7.8 11.1 5.6 Capital expenditure accruals (20.4) (35.7) Total $2,041.5 $943.9 $752.7 In 2007 and 2006, Market Resources increased drilling activity at Pinedale and in the Midcontinent region. During 2007, Market Resources participated in 607 wells (202.8 net), resulting in 199.9 net successful gas and oil wells and 2.9 net dry or abandoned wells. The 2007 net drilling success rate was 98.6%. There were 167 gross wells in progress at year end. Market Resources also increased investment in its midstream gathering and processing services business to expand capacity in both western Wyoming and eastern Utah in response to growing equity and third party production volumes. On January 31, 2008, Questar E&P entered into agreements with multiple private sellers to acquire two significant natural gas development properties in northwest Louisiana for an aggregate purchase price of $655 million. In February 2008, Market Resources established a $700 million term loan credit facility to finance the purchase of the Louisiana natural gas development properties. Market Resources pla ns to expand its current revolving credit facility to $800 million and issue up to $500 million of additional long term debt to retire the $700 million term loan credit facility. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commitments In the course of ordinary business activities, Market Resources enters into a variety of contractual cash obligations and other commitments. The following table summarizes the significant contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2007: Payments Due by Year Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 After 2012 (in millions) Long term debt $500.0 $150.0 $100.0 $250.0 Interest on fixed rate long term debt 166.7 $26.4 $26.4 $26.4 17.0 15.1 55.4 Transportation contracts 55.5 8.7 7.9 7.6 7.3 5.3 18.7 Operating leases 16.4 3.6 3.6 3.3 2.8 1.8 1.3 Total $738.6 $38.7 $37.9 $37.3 $177.1 $122.2 $325.4 The Company had $100 million of variable rate long term debt outstanding due 2012 with an interest rate of 5.55% at December 31, 2007. Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Assumptions Market Resources significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report. The Companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported results of operations and financial position. The following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment on the part of management. Gas and Oil Reserves Gas and oil reserve estimates require significant judgments in the evaluation of all available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given field may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, production history, and economic assumptions relating to commodity prices, production costs, severance and other taxes, capital expenditures and remediation costs. The subjective judgments and variances in data for various fields make these estimates less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures. For 2007, revisions of reserve estimates, other than revisions related to Pinedale increased density, resulted in a 46.2 Bcfe increase in Questar E&Ps proved reserves and a 30.0 Bcfe decrease in cost of service proved reserves. Revisions associated with Pinedale increased density drilling added 126.8 Bcfe to Questar E&Ps estimated prove d reserves at December 31, 2007, and 25.9 Bcfe of additional cost of service proved reserves. See Note 15 for more information on the Companys estimated proved reserves. QUESTAR MARKET RESOURCES 2007 FORM 10 K 25 Successful Efforts Accounting for Gas and Oil Operations The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for gas and oil property acquisitions, exploration, development and production activities. Under this method, the acquisition costs of proved and unproved properties, successful exploratory wells and development wells are capitalized. Other exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs, the delay rental and administrative costs associated with unproved property and unsuccessful exploratory well costs are expensed. Costs to operate and maintain wells and field equipment are expensed as incurred. The capitalized costs of unproved properties are generally combined and amortized over the expected holding period for such properties. Individually significant unproved properties are periodically reviewed for impairment. Capitalized costs of unproved properties are reclassified as proved property when related proved reserves are determined or charged against the impairment allowance when abandoned. Capitalized proved property acquisition costs are amortized by field using the unit of production method based on proved reserves. Capitalized exploratory well and development costs are amortized similarly by field based on proved developed reserves. The calculation takes into consideration estimated future equipment dismantlement, surface restoration and property abandonment costs, net of estimated equipment salvage values. Other property and equipment are generally depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives or the unit of production method for certain processing plants. A gain or loss is generally recognized only when an entire field is sold or abandoned, or if the unit of production amortization rate would be significantly affected. Questar E&P engages independent reservoir engineering consultants to prepare estimates of the proved gas and oil reserves. Reserve estimates are based on a complex and highly interpretive process that is subject to continuous revision as additional production and development drilling information becomes available. Long lived assets are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated on a field by field basis. Impairment is indicated when a triggering event occurs and the sum of estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of the evaluated asset is less than the assets carrying value. The asset value is written down to estimated fair value, which is determined using discounted future net cash flows. Accounting for Derivatives Contracts The Company uses derivative contracts, typically fixed price swaps, to hedge against a decline in the realized prices of its gas and oil production. Accounting rules for derivatives require marking these instruments to fair value at the balance sheet reporting date. The change in fair value is reported either in net income or comprehensive income depending on the structure of the derivatives. The Company has structured virtually all energy derivative instruments as cash flow hedges as defined in SFAS 133 as amended. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded on the balance sheet and in comprehensive income or loss until the underlying gas or oil is produced. When a derivative is terminated before its contract expires, the associated gain or loss is recognized in income over the life of the previously hedged production. Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized in the period that services are provided or products are delivered. Questar E&P uses the sales method of accounting whereby revenue is recognized for all gas, oil and NGL sold to purchasers. Revenues include estimates for the two most recent months using published commodity price indexes and volumes supplied by field operators. A liability is recorded to the extent that Questar E&P has an imbalance in excess of its share of remaining reserves in an underlying property. Energy Trading presents revenues on a gross revenue basis. Energy Trading does not engage in speculative hedging transactions, nor does it buy and sell energy contracts with the objective of generating profits on short term differences in prices. Recent Accounting Developments Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for a discussion of recent accounting developments. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Market Resources primary market risk exposure arises from commodity price changes for natural gas, oil and NGL, and volatility in interest rates. Energy Trading has long term contracts for pipeline capacity and is obligated for transportation services with no guarantee that it will be able to recover the full cost of these transportation commitments. QUESTAR MARKET RESOURCES 2007 FORM 10 K 26 Commodity Price Risk Management Market Resources uses gas and oil price derivatives in the normal course of business to reduce, or hedge, the risk of adverse commodity price movements. However, these same arrangements typically limit future gains from favorable price movements. Derivative contracts are currently in place for a significant share of Questar E&P owned gas and oil production, a portion of Energy Trading gas and oil marketing transactions and some of Gas Managements NGL sales. Market Resources has established policies and procedures for managing commodity price risks through the use of derivatives. These policies and procedures are reviewed periodically by the Finance and Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. Natural gas and oil price hedging supports Market Resources rate of return and cash flow targets and protects earnings from downward movements in commodity prices. The volume of hedged production and the mix of derivative instruments are regularly evaluated and adjusted by management in response to changing market conditions. Market Resources may hedge up to 100% of forecast production from proved reserves when prices meet earnings and cash flow objectives. Market Resources does not enter into derivative arrangements for speculative purposes. Market Resources uses fixed price swaps to realize a known price for a specific volume of production delivered into a regional sales point. A fixed price swap is a derivative instrument that exchanges or swaps the floating or daily price of a specified volume of natural gas, oil or NGL, over a specified period, for a fixed price for the specified volume over the same period (typically three months or longer). In the normal course of business, the Company sells its equity natural gas, oil and NGL production to third parties at first of the month or daily floating prices related to indices reported in industry publications. The fixed price swap price is reduced by gathering costs and adjusted for product quality to determine the net to the well price. Swap agreements do not require the physical transfer of gas between the parties at settlement. Swap transactions are settled in cash with one party paying the other for the net difference in prices, multip lied by the relevant volume, for the settlement period. Market Resources enters into commodity price derivative arrangements that do not require collateral deposits. Counterparties include banks and energy trading firms with investment grade credit ratings. The amount of credit available may vary depending on the credit ratings assigned to Market Resources debt. In addition to the counterparty arrangements, Market Resources has a $182.0 million long term revolving credit facility with banks with $100 million borrowed at December 31, 2007. Generally, derivative instruments are matched to equity gas and oil production, thus qualifying as cash flow hedges under the accounting provisions of SFAS 133 as amended and interpreted. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded on the balance sheet and in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the underlying gas or oil is produced. Gas hedges are typically structured as fixed price swaps into regional pipelines, locking in basis and hedge effectiveness. The ineffective portion of cash flow hedges is immediately recognized in the determination of net income. Market Resources began using natural gas basis only swaps in 2006 to manage the risk of a widening of basis differentials in the Rocky Mountains. These contracts are marked to market with any change in the valuation recognized in the determination of net income.

A QUESTAR MARKET RESOURCES 2007 FORM 10 K 28 year earlier Market Resources hedging contracts covered 204.2 million MMBtu of natural gas, 1.8 million barrels of oil, 22.7 million gallons of NGL and natural gas basis only swaps on an additional 47.7 Bcf. The following table summarizes changes in the fair value of derivative contracts from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007: Fixed Price Swaps Basis Only Swaps Total (in millions) Net fair value of gas and oil derivative contracts outstanding at December 31, 2006 $205.6 ($ 1.9) $203.7 Contracts realized or otherwise settled (153.9) (1.2) (155.1) Change in gas and oil prices on futures markets (112.4) (30.4) (142.8) Contracts added 111.8 36.9 148.7 Contracts redesignated as fixed price swaps (0.4) 0.4 Net fair value of gas and oil derivative contracts outstanding at December 31, 2007 $ 50.7 $ 3.8 $ 54.5 A table of the net fair value of gas and oil derivative contracts as of December 31, 2007, is shown below. About $68.8 million of the fair value of all contracts will settle in the next 12 months and the fair value of cash flow hedges will be reclassified from other comprehensive income: Fixed Price Swaps Basis Only Swaps Total (in millions) Contracts maturing by December 31, 2008 $70.2 ($ 1.4) $68.8 Contracts maturing between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009 (13.7) 5.3 (8.4) Contracts maturing between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2010 (5.8) (0.1) (5.9) Net fair value of gas and oil derivative contracts outstanding at December 31, 2007 $50.7 $ 3.8 $54.5 The following table shows sensitivity of fair value of gas and oil derivative contracts and basis only swaps to changes in the market price of gas and oil and basis differentials: At December 31, 2007 2006 (in millions) Net fair value asset (liability) $ 54.5 $203.7 Value if market prices of gas and oil and basis differentials decline by 10% 217.7 334.6 Value if market prices of gas and oil and basis differentials increase by 10% (108.8) 72.8 Credit Risk Market Resources requests credit support and, in some cases, prepayment from companies with unacceptable credit risks. Market Resources five largest customers are Sempra Energy Trading Corp., Enterprise Products Operating, Chevron USA Inc., Nevada Power Company, and Occidental Energy Marketing Inc. Sales to these companies accounted for 19% of Market Resources revenues before elimination of intercompany transactions in 2007, and their accounts were current at December 31, 2007. Interest Rate Risk The fair value of fixed rate debt is subject to change as interest rates fluctuate. The Company had $400.0 million of fixed rate long term debt at December 31, 2007 and 2006 with fair values of $403.1 million at December 31, 2007 and $412.8 million at December 31, 2006. If interest rates had declined 10%, fair value would increase to $416.2 million in 2007 and $427.2 million in 2006. The fair value calculations do not represent the cost to retire the debt securities. QUESTAR MARKET RESOURCES 2007 FORM 10 K 29
