ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION. SUMMARY Market Resources net income increased 39% in 2008 compared to 2007 and 18% in 2007 over 2006 primary due to higher realized natural gas, crude oil and NGL prices, higher gathering and processing margins at Gas Management and an increased investment base at Wexpro. Following are comparisons of net income by line of business: Questar Market Resources 2008 Form 10 K 19 Year Ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (in millions) Exploration and Production Questar E&P $408.0 $285.5 $253.9 $122.5 $31.6 Wexpro 73.9 59.2 50.0 14.7 9.2 Midstream Field Services Gas Management 81.5 55.3 42.6 26.2 12.7 Energy Marketing Energy Trading, and other 22.1 20.8 9.6 1.3 11.2 Net Income $585.5 $420.8 $356.1 $164.7 $64.7 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION Questar E&P Following is a summary of Questar E&P financial and operating results: Year Ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (in millions) Operating Income REVENUES Natural gas sales $1,147.7 $786.9 $681.6 $360.8 $105.3 Oil and NGL sales 237.5 164.2 128.6 73.3 35.6 Other 6.9 4.9 5.5 2.0 (0.6) Total Revenues 1,392.1 956.0 815.7 436.1 140.3 OPERATING EXPENSES Operating and maintenance 125.4 87.9 73.6 37.5 14.3 General and administrative 55.8 56.3 42.4 (0.5) 13.9 Production and other taxes 104.0 60.1 58.3 43.9 1.8 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 330.9 243.5 185.7 87.4 57.8 Exploration 29.3 22.0 34.4 7.3 (12.4) Abandonment and impairment 44.6 10.8 7.6 33.8 3.2 Natural gas purchases 0.5 2.2 2.8 (1.7) (0.6) Total Operating Expenses 690.5 482.8 404.8 207.7 78.0 Net gain (loss) from asset sales 60.4 (0.6) 24.3 61.0 (24.9) Operating Income $ 762.0 $472.6 $435.2 $289.4 $ 37.4 Operating Statistics Production Volumes Natural gas (Bcf) 151.9 121.9 113.9 30.0 8.0 Oil and NGL (MMbbl) 3.3 3.0 2.6 0.3 0.4 Total production (Bcfe) 171.4 140.2 129.6 31.2 10.6 Average daily production (MMcfe) 468.3 384.1 355.2 84.2 28.9 Average realized price, net to the well (including hedges) Natural gas (per Mcf) $ 7.56 $ 6.45 $ 5.98 $ 1.11 $ 0.47 Oil and NGL (per bbl) 72.96 53.99 49.12 18.97 4.87 Questar Market Resources 2008 Form 10 K 20 Questar E&P reported net income of $408.0 million in 2008, up 43% from $285.5 million in 2007 and $253.9 million in 2006. Higher realized natural gas, crude oil and NGL prices and growing production more than offset a 17% increase in 2008 average production costs. Net mark to market losses on natural gas basis only hedges decreased pre tax income $79.2 million in 2008 compared to net pre tax gains of $5.7 million a year earlier. Net gains from sales of assets at Questar E&P increased pre tax income $60.4 million in 2008 compared to a net pre tax loss of $0.6 million in the year earlier period. Questar E&P production volumes totaled 171.4 Bcfe in 2008 compared to 140.2 Bcfe in 2007 and 129.6 Bcfe in 2006. On an energy equivalent basis, natural gas comprised approximately 89% of Questar E&P 2008 production. A comparison of natural gas equivalent production by major operating area is shown in the following table: Year Ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (in Bcfe) Pinedale Anticline 56.8 47.4 39.5 9.4 7.9 Uinta Basin 26.9 25.4 25.1 1.5 0.3 Rockies Legacy 19.9 16.4 18.3 3.5 (1.9) Rocky Mountain total(a) 103.6 89.2 82.9 14.4 6.3 Midcontinent 67.8 51.0 46.7 16.8 4.3 Total Questar E&P 171.4 140.2 129.6 31.2 10.6 (a)Questar E&P temporarily shut in approximately 1.4 Bcfe of net production in 2008 and 10.3 Bcfe in 2007 in the Rocky Mountain region in response to low natural gas prices. Questar E&P net production from the Pinedale Anticline in western Wyoming grew 20% to 56.8 Bcfe in 2008 as a result of ongoing development drilling. Historically, Pinedale seasonal access restrictions imposed by the Bureau of Land Management have limited the ability to drill and complete wells during the mid November to early May period. In September 2008, the BLM issued a Record of Decision (ROD) on the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for long term development of natural gas resources in the Pinedale Anticline Project Area (PAPA). Under the ROD, Questar E&P and Wexpro will be allowed to drill and complete wells year round in one of the five Concentrated Development Areas defined in the PAPA. The ROD contains additional requirements and restrictions on development of the PAPA. In the Uinta Basin, Questar E&Ps net production grew 6% to 26.9 Bcfe in 2008. Production volumes were adversely impacted by connection of new, deep, high pressure wells to the existing gathering infrastructure. Connection of the new deep wells resulted in high gathering system pressure that negatively impacted production from existing shallower and lower pressure Wasatch/Mesaverde wells. Gathering infrastructure improvements are underway to address the situation, but right of way permitting issues could delay installation until mid 2009. Rockies Legacy net production in 2008 grew 21% to 19.9 Bcfe, 3.5 Bcfe higher than the year ago period. Increased production volumes were driven by new wells and the acquisition of additional interests in the Wamsutter area of the Green River Basin in Wyoming, and increased production from outside operated oil wells in the Williston Basin in North Dakota. Questar E&P Rockies Legacy properties include all Rocky Mountain region properties except the Pinedale Anticline and the Uinta Basin. Net production in the Midcontinent grew 33% to 67.8 Bcfe in 2008, 16.8 Bcfe higher than 2007. Midcontinent production growth was driven by the first quarter 2008 acquisition of new natural gas development properties in northwest Louisiana, ongoing infill development drilling in the Elm Grove field in northwest Louisiana, continued development of the Granite Wash/Atoka/Morrow play in the Texas Panhandle, and production from new outside operated Woodford Shale horizontal gas wells in the Anadarko Basin in central Oklahoma. Realized prices for natural gas, oil and NGL at Questar E&P were higher when compared to the prior year. In 2008, the weighted average realized natural gas price for Questar E&P (including the impact of hedging) was $7.56 per Mcf compared to $6.45 per Mcf in 2007, a 17% increase. Realized oil and NGL prices in 2008 averaged $72.96 per bbl, compared with $53.99 per bbl during the prior year, a 35% increase. A regional comparison of average realized prices, including hedges, is shown in the following table: Questar Market Resources 2008 Form 10 K 21 Year Ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Natural gas (per Mcf) Rocky Mountains $6.85 $5.90 $5.70 $0.95 $0.20 Midcontinent 8.63 7.42 6.46 1.21 0.96 Volume weighted average 7.56 6.45 5.98 1.11 0.47 Oil and NGL (per bbl) Rocky Mountains $73.05 $53.51 $46.62 $19.54 $6.89 Midcontinent 72.82 54.85 54.93 17.97 (0.08) Volume weighted average 72.96 53.99 49.12 18.97 4.87 Questar E&P may hedge up to 100% of forecasted production from proved reserves to lock in acceptable returns on invested capital and to protect cash flow and net income from a decline in commodity prices. Also, Questar E&P may use basis only swaps to protect cash flows and net income from widening natural gas price basis differentials that may result from capacity constraints on regional gas pipelines. Questar E&P hedged or pre sold approximately 82% of gas production in 2008 and hedged or pre sold 75% of gas production in 2007. Hedging increased Questar E&P gas revenues by $125.8 million in 2008 and increased revenues $245.7 million in 2007. Approximately 50% of 2008 and 61% of 2007 Questar E&P oil production was hedged or pre sold. Oil hedges reduced oil revenues by $31.9 million in 2008 and $17.2 million in 2007. The net mark to market effect of basis only swaps is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income below operating income. Derivative positions as of December 31, 2008, are summarized in Item 7A of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Questar E&P production costs (the sum of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, lease operating expense, general and administrative expense, allocated interest expense and production taxes) per Mcfe of production increased 17% to $3.94 per Mcfe in 2008 versus $3.38 per Mcfe in 2007. Questar E&P production costs are summarized in the following table: Year Ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (per Mcfe) Depreciation, depletion and amortization $1.93 $1.74 $1.43 $0.19 $0.31 Lease operating expense 0.73 0.63 0.57 0.10 0.06 General and administrative expense 0.33 0.40 0.33 (0.07) 0.07 Allocated interest expense 0.34 0.18 0.21 0.16 (0.03) Production taxes 0.61 0.43 0.45 0.18 (0.02) Total Production Costs $3.94 $3.38 $2.99 $0.56 $0.39 Production volume weighted average depreciation, depletion and amortization per Mcfe (DD&A rate) increased due to higher costs for drilling, completion and related services, increased cost of steel casing, other tubulars and wellhead equipment. The DD&A rate also increased due to the ongoing depletion of older, lower cost reserves and the increasing component of Questar E&P production derived from recently acquired, higher cost fields in the Midcontinent. Lease operating expense per Mcfe increased due to higher costs of materials and consumables, increased produced water disposal costs and increased well workover activity. General and administrative expense per Mcfe decreased as a result of increased production. Allocated interest expense per Mcfe of production increased primarily due to financing costs related to the first quarter 2008 acquisition of natural gas development properties in northwest Louisiana. Production taxes per Mcfe increased in 2008 as the result higher n atural gas and oil sales prices. The company pays production taxes based on a percentage of sales prices excluding the impact of hedges. Questar E&P exploration expense increased $7.3 million or 33% in 2008 compared to 2007. Abandonment and impairment expense increased $33.8 million or 313% in 2008 compared to 2007. Abandonment and impairment expense increased $29.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the same period of 2007. Lower year end 2008 gas and oil prices triggered impairment testing of long lived assets. Future cash flows using estimated forward looking commodity prices were sufficient to recover the investment of a majority of the long lived assets. A combination of poor production performance, higher production costs and negative reserve revisions resulted in the impairment of certain gas and oil assets in 2008. Questar Market Resources 2008 Form 10 K 22 In the third quarter of 2008, Questar E&P sold certain outside operated producing properties and leaseholds in the Gulf Coast region of south Texas and recognized a pre tax gain of approximately $61.2 million. These properties contributed 2.8 Bcfe to Questar E&P net production in 2008. In 2006, Questar E&P sold certain proved reserves and undeveloped leasehold interests in western Colorado and recognized a pre tax gain of $22.7 million. Major Questar E&P Operating Areas Pinedale Anticline As of December 31, 2008, Market Resources (including both Questar E&P and Wexpro) operated and had working interests in 331 producing wells on the Pinedale Anticline compared to 250 at December 31, 2007. Of the 331 producing wells, Questar E&P has working interests in 309 wells, overriding royalty interests in an additional 21 Wexpro operated wells, and no interest in one well operated by Wexpro. Wexpro has working interests in 107 of the 331 producing wells. In 2005, the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (WOGCC) approved 10 acre density drilling for Lance Pool wells on about 12,700 acres of Market Resources 17,872 acre (gross) Pinedale leasehold. The area approved for increased density corresponds to the currently estimated productive limits of Market Resources core acreage in the field. At December 31, 2008, Questar E&P had booked 400 proved undeveloped locations on a combination of 5 , 10 and 20 acre density and reported estimated net proved reserves at Pinedale of 1,164.9 Bcfe, or 53% of Questar E&P total proved reserves. The Company continues to evaluate development on five acre density at Pinedale. In January 2008, the WOGCC approved five acre density drilling for Lance Pool wells on about 4,200 gross acres of Market Resources Pinedale leasehold. If five acre density development is appropriate for a majority of its leasehold, the Company currently estimates up to 1,500 additional wells will be required to fully devel op the Lance Pool on its acreage. Uinta Basin As of December 31, 2008, Questar E&P had an operating interest in 909 gross producing wells in the Uinta Basin of eastern Utah, compared to 857 at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2008, Questar E&P had booked 114 proved undeveloped locations and reported estimated net proved reserves in the Uinta Basin of 258.8 Bcfe or 12% of Questar E&P total proved reserves. Uinta Basin reserves declined 14% due to lower year end 2008 gas and oil prices and a price related slow down in development drilling. Uinta Basin proved reserves are found in a series of vertically stacked, laterally discontinuous reservoirs at depths of 5,000 feet to deeper than 18,000 feet. Questar E&P owns interests in over 252,000 gross leasehold acres in the Uinta Basin. Rockies Legacy The remainder of Questar E&P Rocky Mountain region leasehold interests, productive wells and proved reserves are distributed over a number of fields and properties managed as the company Rockies Legacy division. Most of the properties are located in the Greater Green River Basin of western Wyoming. In aggregate, Rockies Legacy properties comprised 163.6 Bcfe or 7% of Questar E&P total proved reserves at December 31, 2008. Exploration and development activity for 2008 includes wells in the San Juan, Paradox, Powder River, Green River, Vermillion and Williston Basins. Midcontinent Questar E&P Midcontinent properties are distributed over a large area, including the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, the Arkoma Basin of Oklahoma and western Arkansas, and the Ark La Tex region of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas. With the exception of northwest Louisiana, the Granite Wash play in the Texas Panhandle and the emerging Woodford Shale play in western Oklahoma, Questar E&P Midcontinent leasehold interests are fragmented, with no significant concentration of property interests. In aggregate, Midcontinent properties comprised 630.8 Bcfe or 28% of Questar E&P total proved reserves at December 31, 2008. Questar E&P has approximately 31,000 net acres of Haynesville Shale lease rights in northwest Louisiana. The depth of the top of the Haynesville Shale ranges from approximately 10,500 feet to 12,500 feet across Questar E&Ps leasehold and is below the Hosston and Cotton Valley formations that Questar E&P has been developing in northwest Louisiana for over a decade. Questar E&P continues infill development drilling in the Cotton Valley and Hosston formations in northwest Louisiana and intends to drill or participate in up to 35 horizontal Haynesville Shale wells in 2009. As of December 31, 2008, Questar E&P had 11 operated rigs drilling in the project area and operated or had working interests in 539 producing wells in northwest Louisiana compared to 463 at December 31, 2007. Wexpro Wexpro reported net income of $73.9 million in 2008 compared to $59.2 million in 2007, a 25% increase and $50.0 million in 2006. Wexpro 2008 results benefited from a higher average investment base compared to the prior year period. Pursuant to the Wexpro Agreement, Wexpro recovers its costs and receives an unlevered after tax return of approximately 19 20% on its Questar Market Resources 2008 Form 10 K 23 investment base. Wexpros investment base is its investment in commercial wells and related facilities adjusted for working capital and reduced for deferred income taxes and depreciation. Wexpros investment base totaled $410.6 million at December 31, 2008, an increase of $110.2 million or 37% since December 31, 2007. Wexpro produced 46.1 Bcf of cost of service gas in 2008.

Net income growth was driven by higher gathering and processing margins. Total gathering margins (revenues minus direct gathering expenses) in 2008 increased 74% to $116.9 million compared to $67.1 million in 2007. Expanding Pinedale production, new projects serving third parties in the Uinta Basin and the consolidation of Rendezvous contributed to a 38% increase in third party volumes in 2008. Gathering volumes increased 102.3 million MMBtu, or 35% to 392.5 million MMBtu in 2008. Rendezvous, formerly an unconsolidated affiliate, was consolidated with Gas Management beginning in 2008 and accounted for 39.0 million MMBtu. Rendezvous provides gas gathering services for the Pinedale and Jonah producing areas of Wyoming. Questar Market Resources 2008 Form 10 K 24 Total processing margins (revenues minus direct plant expenses and processing plant shrink) in 2008 increased 41% to $78.1 million compared to $55.4 million in 2007. Fee based gas processing volumes were 201.5 million MMBtu in 2008, a 59% increase compared to 2007. In 2008, fee based gas processing revenues increased 57% or $10.6 million, while the frac spread from keep whole processing increased 28% or $12.4 million. Approximately 76% of Gas Managements net operating revenue (revenue minus processing plant shrink) in 2008 was derived from fee based contracts, up from 74% in 2007. Gas Management may use forward sales contracts to reduce margin volatility associated with keep whole contracts. Forward sales contracts reduced NGL revenues by $1.4 million in 2008 and $5.9 million in 2007. ENERGY MARKETING Questar Energy Trading Energy Trading net income was $22.1 million in 2008, an increase of 6% compared to 2007 net income of $20.8 million and 2006 net income of $9.6 million as a result of increased revenues from liquids produced from Clear Creek gas storage facility and higher total marketing fees. Revenues from unaffiliated customers were $608.1 million in 2008 compared to $504.4 million in 2007, a 21% increase, primarily the result of higher natural gas prices. The weighted average natural gas sales price increased 51% in 2008 to $6.34 per MMBtu, compared to $4.21 per MMBtu in 2007. Consolidated Results below Operating Income Interest and Other Income Interest and other income increased $4.9 million or 51% in 2008 compared with 2007 $5.6 million or 137% in 2007 compared with 2006. In 2008, gains from inventory sales accounted for the majority of the increase, while the 2007 increase was the result of higher 2007 interest income and a $1.7 million loss from a 2006 early extinguishment of debt. Income from unconsolidated affiliates Income from unconsolidated affiliates was $1.7 million in 2008 compared to $8.9 million in 2007 and $7.5 million in 2006. Rendezvous Gas Services, which accounted for the majority of income from unconsolidated affiliates in 2007 and 2006, was consolidated beginning in 2008. Net mark to market gain (loss) on basis only swaps The Company uses basis only swaps to protect cash flows and net income from widening natural gas price basis differentials that may result from capacity constraints on regional gas pipelines. The Company recognized a pre tax net mark to market loss of $79.2 million on natural gas basis only swaps in 2008 compared to a $5.7 million pre tax gain in 2007 and a $1.9 million pre tax loss in 2006. Interest expense Interest expense rose 75% in 2008 compared to 2007 due primarily to financing activities associated with the purchase of natural gas development properties in northwest Louisiana. Interest rates on the Questars commercial paper borrowings spiked in September 2008 and later retreated reflecting increased liquidity pressures and turmoil generally experienced by financial markets. Questar maintains committed credit lines with banks to provide liquidity when commercial paper markets are illiquid. Interest expense increased 5% in 2007 compared to 2006. Income taxes The effective combined federal and state income tax rate was 35.7% in 2008 compared with 36.4% in 2007 and 36.7% in 2006. Investing Activities Capital spending in 2008 amounted to $2,280.5 million. The details of capital expenditures in 2008 and 2007 and a forecast for 2009 are shown in the table below: Year Ended December 31, 2009 Forecast 2008 2007 (in millions) Drilling and other exploration $ 790.1 $1,136.4 $678.7 Reserve acquisitions 727.8 46.1 Wexpro development drilling 114.5 144.8 109.4 Midstream field services 149.1 394.5 128.1 Energy Trading and other 40.2 1.6 2.0 Capital expenditure accruals (124.6) (20.4) Total $1,093.9 $2,280.5 $943.9 Questar Market Resources 2008 Form 10 K 25 Market Resources capital expenditures increased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to property acquisitions, an expanded drilling program and higher investments in gathering and processing facilities in the Rockies. In February 2008, Questar E&P acquired natural gas development properties in northwest Louisiana for an aggregate purchase price of $652.1 million. During 2008, Market Resources participated in 697 wells (267.2 net), resulting in 260.1 net successful gas and oil wells and 7.1 net dry or abandoned wells. The 2008 net drilling success rate was 97.3%. There were 182 gross wells in progress at year end. Gas Management increased its investment in midstream gathering and processing services business to expand capacity in both western Wyoming and eastern Utah in response to growing equity and third party production volumes. Standard & Poors Resolves Credit Ratings for Questar and its subsidiaries On February 25, 2009, Standard & Poors affirmed both Questars commercial paper rating of A2 and Market Resources BBB+ long term debt rating, both with stable outlooks. This action followed Standard & Poors earlier announcement on October 15, 2008, that it had placed Questar and its subsidiaries on CreditWatch with negative implications and was initiating a review of Questars ratings. Standard & Poors review considered Questars increasing capital spending and the resulting higher proportion of operating income from gas and oil exploration and production activities, in addition to the volatility of gas and oil prices. Current ratings of senior unsecured debt are as follows: Moodys Standard & Poors Market Resources Baa3 BBB+ Questar commercial paper P2 A2 Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commitments In the course of ordinary business activities, Market Resources enters into a variety of contractual cash obligations and other commitments.

Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Assumptions Gas and Oil Reserves Gas and oil reserve estimates require significant judgments in the evaluation of all available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given field may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, production history, and economic assumptions relating to commodity prices, production costs, severance and other taxes, capital expenditures and remediation costs. The subjective judgments and variances in data for various fields make these estimates less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures. For 2008, revisions of reserve estimates, other than revisions related to Pinedale increased density, resulted in a 152.9 Bcfe decrease in Questar E&Ps proved reserves and a 20.2 Bcfe decrease in cost of service proved reserves. Revisions associated with Pinedale increased density drilling added 161.8 Bcfe to Questar E&Ps estimated prov ed reserves at December 31, 2008, and 68.2 Bcfe of additional cost of service proved reserves. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for more information on the Companys estimated proved reserves. Successful Efforts Accounting for Gas and Oil Operations The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for gas and oil property acquisitions, exploration, development and production activities. Under this method, the acquisition costs of proved and unproved properties, successful Questar Market Resources 2008 Form 10 K 26 exploratory wells and development wells are capitalized. Other exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs, the delay rental and administrative costs associated with unproved property and unsuccessful exploratory well costs are expensed. Costs to operate and maintain wells and field equipment are expensed as incurred. The capitalized costs of unproved properties are generally combined and amortized over the expected holding period for such properties. Individually significant unproved properties are periodically reviewed for impairment. Capitalized costs of unproved properties are reclassified as proved property when related proved reserves are determined or charged against the impairment allowance when abandoned. Capitalized proved property acquisition costs are amortized by field using the unit of production method based on proved reserves. Capitalized exploratory well and development costs are amortized similarly by field based on proved developed reserves. The calculation takes into consideration estimated future equipment dismantlement, surface restoration and property abandonment costs, net of estimated equipment salvage values. Other property and equipment are generally depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives or the unit of production method for certain processing plants. A gain or loss is generally recognized only when an entire field is sold or abandoned, or if the unit of production amortization rate would be significantly affected. Questar E&P engages independent reservoir engineering consultants to prepare estimates of the proved gas and oil reserves. Reserve estimates are based on a complex and highly interpretive process that is subject to continuous revision as additional production and development drilling information becomes available. Long lived assets are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated on a field by field basis. Impairment is indicated when a triggering event occurs and the sum of estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of the evaluated asset is less than the assets carrying value. The asset value is written down to estimated fair value, which is determined using discounted future net cash flows. Accounting for Derivative Contracts The Company uses derivative contracts, typically fixed price swaps, to hedge against a decline in the realized prices of its gas and oil production. Accounting rules for derivatives require marking these instruments to fair value at the balance sheet reporting date. The change in fair value is reported either in net income or comprehensive income depending on the structure of the derivatives. The Company has structured virtually all energy derivative instruments as cash flow hedges as defined in SFAS 133 as amended. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded on the balance sheet and in comprehensive income or loss until the underlying gas or oil is produced. When a derivative is terminated before its contract expires, the associated gain or loss is recognized in income over the life of the previously hedged production. Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized in the period that services are provided or products are delivered. Questar E&P uses the sales method of accounting whereby revenue is recognized for all gas, oil and NGL sold to purchasers. Revenues include estimates for the two most recent months using published commodity price indexes and volumes supplied by field operators. A liability is recorded to the extent that Questar E&P has an imbalance in excess of its share of remaining reserves in an underlying property. Energy Trading presents revenues on a gross revenue basis. Energy Trading does not engage in speculative hedging transactions, nor does it buy and sell energy contracts with the objective of generating profits on short term differences in prices. Recent Accounting Developments Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for a discussion of recent accounting developments. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Market Resources primary market risk exposure arises from changes in the market price for natural gas, oil and NGL, and volatility in interest rates. Energy Trading has long term contracts for pipeline capacity and is obligated to pay for transportation services with no guarantee that it will be able to recover the full cost of these transportation commitments. Commodity Price Risk Management Market Resources uses gas and oil price derivatives in the normal course of business to reduce, or hedge, the risk of adverse commodity price movements. However, these same arrangements typically limit future gains from favorable price movements. Derivative contracts are currently in place for a significant share of Questar E&P owned gas and oil production and a portion of Energy Trading gas and oil marketing transactions Questar Market Resources 2008 Form 10 K 27 Market Resources has established policies and procedures for managing commodity price risks through the use of derivatives. These policies and procedures are reviewed periodically by the Finance and Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. Market Resources hedges natural gas and oil prices to support rate of return and cash flow targets and protect earnings from downward movements in commodity prices. The volume of hedged production and the mix of derivative instruments are regularly evaluated and adjusted by management in response to changing market conditions. Market Resources may hedge up to 100% of forecast production from proved reserves when prices meet earnings and cash flow objectives. Market Resources does not enter into derivative arrangements for speculative purposes. Market Resources uses fixed price swaps to realize a known price for a specific volume of production delivered into a regional sales point. A fixed price swap is a derivative instrument that exchanges or swaps the floating or daily price of a specified volume of natural gas, oil or NGL, over a specified period, for a fixed price for the specified volume over the same period (typically three months or longer). In the normal course of business, the Company sells its equity natural gas, oil and NGL production to third parties at first of the month or daily floating prices related to indices reported in industry publications. The fixed price swap price is reduced by gathering costs and adjusted for product quality to determine the net to the well price. Swap agreements do not require the physical transfer of gas between the parties at settlement. Swap transactions are settled in cash with one party paying the other for the net difference in prices, multip lied by the relevant volume, for the settlement period. Market Resources enters into commodity price derivative arrangements that do not have margin requirements or collateral provisions that would require funding prior to the scheduled cash settlement dates. The amount of credit available under these arrangements may vary depending on the credit ratings assigned to Market Resources debt. Derivative arrangement counterparties are normally banks and energy trading firms with investment grade credit ratings. The Company regularly monitors counterparty exposure, credit worthiness and performance. Generally, derivative instruments are matched to equity gas and oil production, thus qualifying as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the underlying gas or oil is produced. Gas hedges are typically structured as fixed price swaps into regional pipelines, locking in basis and hedge effectiveness. The ineffective portion of cash flow hedges is immediately recognized in the determination of net income. Market Resources uses natural gas basis only swaps to manage the risk of widening basis differentials in the Rocky Mountains. These contracts are marked to market with any change in the valuation recognized in the determination of net income. A summary of the Market Resources derivative positions for equity production as of December 31, 2008, is shown below: Rocky Rocky Time Periods Mountains Midcontinent Total Mountains Midcontinent Total Estimated Gas (Bcf) Fixed price Swaps Average price per Mcf, net to the well 2009 First half 34.5 29.5 64.0 $7.24 $8.12 $7.65 Second half 35.0 30.0 65.0 7.24 8.12 7.65 12 months 69.5 59.5 129.0 7.24 8.12 7.65 2010 First half 6.7 26.2 32.9 $6.88 $8.09 $7.84 Second half 6.8 26.6 33.4 6.88 8.09 7.84 12 months 13.5 52.8 66.3 6.88 8.09 7.84 Estimated Gas (Bcf) Basis only Swaps Average basis per Mcf, net to the well 2009 First half 9.3 3.3 12.6 $2.94 $1.22 $2.49 Questar Market Resources 2008 Form 10 K 28 Second half 9.4 3.4 12.8 2.94 1.22 2.49 12 months 18.7 6.7 25.4 2.94 1.22 2.49 2010 First half 30.2 6.6 36.8 $3.39 $0.95 $2.95 Second half 30.7 6.8 37.5 3.39 0.95 2.95 12 months 60.9 13.4 74.3 3.39 0.95 2.95 2011 First half 45.3 6.9 52.2 $2.29 $0.79 $2.09 Second half 46.1 6.9 53.0 2.29 0.79 2.09 12 months 91.4 13.8 105.2 2.29 0.79 2.09 Estimated Oil (Mbbl) Fixed price Swaps Average price per bbl, net to the well 2009 First half 217 145 362 $60.55 $66.55 $62.95 Second half 221 147 368 60.55 66.55 62.95 12 months 438 292 730 60.55 66.55 62.95 As of December 31, 2008, Market Resources held commodity price hedging contracts covering about 234.4 million MMBtu of natural gas, 0.7 million barrels of oil and basis only swaps on an additional 204.9 Bcf of natural gas. A year earlier Market Resources hedging contracts covered 245.0 million MMBtu of natural gas, 2.0 million barrels of oil, 5.0 million gallons of NGL and natural gas basis only swaps on an additional 40.8 Bcf. Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008, are presented below: Fixed price Basis only Swaps Swaps Total (in millions) Net fair value of gas and oil derivative contracts outstanding at Dec. 31, 2007 $ 50.7 $ 3.8 $ 54.5 Contracts realized or otherwise settled (7.5) (0.2) (7.7) Change in gas and oil prices on futures markets 241.0 2.4 243.4 Contracts added 273.6 (95.7) 177.9 Contracts redesignated as fixed price swaps (14.2) 14.2 Net Fair Value Of Gas and Oil Derivative Contracts Outstanding at Dec. 31, 2008 $543.6 ($75.5) $468.1 A table of the net fair value of gas and oil derivative contracts as of December 31, 2008, is shown below. About 92% of the contracts will settle in the next 12 months and the fair value of cash flow hedges will be reclassified from other comprehensive income: Fixed price Basis only Swaps Swaps Total (in millions) Contracts maturing by Dec. 31, 2009 $431.2 ($0.4) $430.8 Contracts maturing between Jan. 1, 2010 and Dec. 31, 2010 112.4 (60.4) 52.0 Contracts maturing between Jan. 1, 2011 and Dec. 31, 2011 (14.7) (14.7) Net Fair Value Of Gas and Oil Derivative Contracts Outstanding at Dec. 31, 2008 $543.6 ($75.5) $468.1 Questar Market Resources 2008 Form 10 K 29 The following table shows sensitivity of fair value of gas and oil derivative contracts and basis only swaps to changes in the market price of gas and oil and basis differentials: At December 31, 2008 2007 (in millions) Net fair value asset (liability) $468.1 $ 54.5 Value if market prices of gas and oil and basis differentials decline by 10% 590.4 217.7 Value if market prices of gas and oil and basis differentials increase by 10% 345.9 (108.8) Credit Risk Market Resources requests credit support and, in some cases, prepayment from companies with unacceptable credit risks. Market Resources five largest customers are Sempra Energy Trading Corp., Enterprise Products Operating, Chevron USA Inc., Occidental Energy Marketing Inc. and Nevada Power Company. Sales to these companies accounted for 20% of Market Resources revenues before elimination of intercompany transactions in 2008, and their accounts were current at December 31, 2008. Interest Rate Risk The fair value of fixed rate debt is subject to change as interest rates fluctuate. The Companys ability to borrow and the rates quoted by lenders have been adversely affected by the illiquid credit markets as described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The Company had $850.0 million of fixed rate long term debt with a fair value of $730.9 million at December 31, 2008. A year earlier the Company had $400.0 million of fixed rate long term debt with a fair value of $403.1 million. If interest rates had declined 10%, fair value would increase to $767.8 million in 2008 and $416.2 million in 2007. The fair value calculations do not represent the cost to retire the debt securities.
