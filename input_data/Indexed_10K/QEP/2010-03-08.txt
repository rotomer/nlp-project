ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SUMMARY Market Resources net income decreased 50% in 2009 compared with 2008 due to lower realized natural gas, crude oil and NGL prices and lower processing margins. Net income increased 39% in 2008 compared to 2007 primary due to higher realized natural gas, crude oil and NGL prices, higher gathering and processing margins at Gas Management and an increased investment base at Wexpro. Following are comparisons of net income attributable to Market Resources by line of business: Year Ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 (in millions) Exploration and Production Questar E&P $134.9 $408.0 $285.5 ($273.1) $122.5 Wexpro 80.7 73.9 59.2 6.8 14.7 Midstream Field Services Gas Management 69.4 81.5 55.3 (12.1) 26.2 Energy Marketing Energy Trading, and other 8.5 22.1 20.8 (13.6) 1.3 Net income attributable to Market Resources $293.5 $585.5 $420.8 ($292.0) $164.7 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION Questar E&P Questar E&P reported net income of $134.9 million in 2009, down 67% from $408.0 million in 2008 and $285.5 million in 2007. Lower realized natural gas, crude oil and NGL prices and an 11% increase in 2009 average production costs more than offset an 11% increase in 2009 production. Unrealized mark to market losses on natural gas basis only hedges decreased pre tax income $164.0 million in 2009 compared to a net pre tax loss of $79.2 million a year earlier. Net gains from sales of assets at Questar E&P increased pre tax income $1.6 million in 2009 compared to a net pre tax gain of $60.4 million in the year earlier period. Following is a summary of Questar E&P financial and operating results: Questar Market Resources 2009 Form 10 K 17 Year Ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 (in millions) Operating Income REVENUES Natural gas sales $1,103.9 $1,147.7 $786.9 ($ 43.8) $360.8 Oil and NGL sales 158.5 237.5 164.2 (79.0) 73.3 Other 4.9 6.9 4.9 (2.0) 2.0 Total Revenues 1,267.3 1,392.1 956.0 (124.8) 436.1 OPERATING EXPENSES Operating and maintenance 127.5 125.4 87.9 2.1 37.5 General and administrative 68.0 55.8 56.3 12.2 (0.5) Production and other taxes 58.3 104.0 60.1 (45.7) 43.9 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 512.8 330.9 243.5 181.9 87.4 Exploration 25.0 29.3 22.0 (4.3) 7.3 Abandonment and impairment 20.3 44.6 10.8 (24.3) 33.8 Natural gas purchases 0.5 2.2 (0.5) (1.7) Total Operating Expenses 811.9 690.5 482.8 121.4 207.7 Net gain (loss) from asset sales 1.6 60.4 (0.6) (58.8) 61.0 Operating Income $ 457.0 $ 762.0 $472.6 ($ 305.0) $289.4 Operating Statistics Production Volumes Natural gas (Bcf) 168.7 151.9 121.9 16.8 30.0 Oil and NGL (MMbbl) 3.5 3.3 3.0 0.2 0.3 Total production (Bcfe) 189.5 171.4 140.2 18.1 31.2 Average daily production (MMcfe) 519.1 468.3 384.1 50.8 84.2 Average realized price, net to the well (including hedges) Natural gas (per Mcf) $ 6.54 $ 7.56 $ 6.45 ($ 1.02) $ 1.11 Oil and NGL (per bbl) 45.91 72.96 53.99 (27.05) 18.97 Questar E&P production volumes totaled 189.5 Bcfe in 2009 compared to 171.4 Bcfe in 2008 and 140.2 Bcfe in 2007. On an energy equivalent basis, natural gas comprised approximately 89% of Questar E&P 2009 production. A comparison of natural gas equivalent production by major operating area is shown in the following table: Year Ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 (in Bcfe) Midcontinent 87.8 67.8 51.0 20.0 16.8 Pinedale Anticline 61.8 56.8 47.4 5.0 9.4 Uinta Basin 23.2 26.9 25.4 (3.7) 1.5 Rockies Legacy 16.7 19.9 16.4 (3.2) 3.5 Total Questar E&P 189.5 171.4 140.2 18.1 31.2 Net production in the Midcontinent grew 29% or 20 Bcfe to 87.8 Bcfe in 2009 compared to 2008. Midcontinent production growth was driven by the first quarter 2008 acquisition of natural gas development properties in northwest Louisiana, ongoing infill development drilling in the Cotton Valley and Haynesville formations in the Elm Grove, Thorn Lake and Woodardville Questar Market Resources 2009 Form 10 K 18 fields in northwest Louisiana, continued development of the Granite Wash/Atoka/Morrow play in the Texas Panhandle, and production from new outside operated Woodford Shale horizontal gas wells in the Anadarko Basin in central Oklahoma. Questar E&P net production from the Pinedale Anticline in western Wyoming grew 9% to 61.8 Bcfe in 2009 as a result of ongoing development drilling. Historically, Pinedale seasonal access restrictions imposed by the Bureau of Land Management have limited the ability to drill and complete wells during the mid November to early May period. In September 2008, the BLM issued a Record of Decision (ROD) on the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for long term development of natural gas resources in the Pinedale Anticline Project Area (PAPA). Under the ROD, Questar E&P and Wexpro have been allowed to drill and complete wells year round in one of the five Concentrated Development Areas defined in the PAPA. The ROD contains additional requirements and restrictions on development of the PAPA. In the Uinta Basin, Questar E&Ps net production decreased 14% to 23.2 Bcfe in 2009. Production volumes were adversely impacted by decreased drilling activity in response to low natural gas prices. Rockies Legacy net production in 2009 decreased 16% to 16.7 Bcfe, 3.2 Bcfe lower than the year ago period. Production volumes were adversely impacted by decreased drilling activity in response to low natural gas prices. Questar E&P Rockies Legacy properties include all Rocky Mountain region properties except the Pinedale Anticline and the Uinta Basin. Realized prices for natural gas, oil and NGL at Questar E&P were lower when compared to the prior year. In 2009, the weighted average realized natural gas price for Questar E&P (including the impact of hedging) was $6.54 per Mcf compared to $7.56 per Mcf in 2008, a 13% decrease. Realized oil and NGL prices in 2009 averaged $45.91 per bbl, compared with $72.96 per bbl during the prior year, a 37% decrease. A regional comparison of average realized prices, including the impact of hedges, is shown in the following table: Year Ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 Natural gas (per Mcf) Midcontinent $ 7.01 $8.63 $7.42 ($ 1.62) $1.21 Rocky Mountains 6.12 6.85 5.90 (0.73) 0.95 Volume weighted average 6.54 7.56 6.45 (1.02) 1.11 Oil and NGL (per bbl) Midcontinent $46.05 $72.82 $54.85 ($26.77) $17.97 Rocky Mountains 45.82 73.05 53.51 (27.23) 19.54 Volume weighted average 45.91 72.96 53.99 (27.05) 18.97 Questar E&P hedged approximately 77% of gas production in 2009 with fixed price swaps. An additional 15% of gas production was subject to basis only swaps. In 2008, approximately 82% of gas production was hedged with fixed price swaps. An additional 3% of gas production was subject to basis only swaps. Hedging increased Questar E&P gas revenues by $599.3 million in 2009 and increased revenues $125.8 million in 2008. Approximately 42% of 2009 and 50% of 2008 Questar E&P oil production was hedged with fixed price swaps. Oil hedges increased oil revenues by $1.6 million in 2009 and reduced oil revenues $31.9 million in 2008. The net mark to market effect of gas basis only swaps is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income below operating income. Derivative positions as of December 31, 2009, are summarized in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Questar E&P production costs (the sum of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, lease operating expense, general and administrative expense, allocated interest expense and production taxes) per Mcfe of production increased 11% to $4.39 per Mcfe in 2009 versus $3.94 per Mcfe in 2008. Questar E&P production costs are summarized in the following table: Year Ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 (per Mcfe) Depreciation, depletion and amortization $2.71 $1.93 $1.74 $0.78 $0.19 Lease operating expense 0.67 0.73 0.63 (0.06) 0.10 General and administrative expense 0.36 0.33 0.40 0.03 (0.07) Allocated interest expense 0.34 0.34 0.18 0.16 Questar Market Resources 2009 Form 10 K 19 Production taxes 0.31 0.61 0.43 (0.30) 0.18 Total Production Costs $4.39 $3.94 $3.38 $0.45 $0.56 Production volume weighted per unit depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense increased compared to 2008 primarily due to price related negative reserve revisions in certain fields and the growing proportion of total production from fields in the Midcontinent that have higher DD&A rates. Lease operating expense per Mcfe decreased primarily as a result of higher production volumes and reduced well workover activity. General and administrative expense per Mcfe increased as a result of increased labor and outside services. Allocated interest expense per Mcfe of production was unchanged. Production taxes per Mcfe decreased in 2009 as the result of lower natural gas and oil sales prices. In most states, the Company pays production taxes based on a percentage of sales prices excluding the impact of hedges. Questar E&P exploration expense decreased $4.3 million or 15% in 2009 compared to 2008. Abandonment and impairment expense decreased $24.3 million or 54% in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the impairment of certain gas and oil assets in 2008. In the third quarter of 2008, Questar E&P sold certain outside operated producing properties and leaseholds in the Gulf Coast region of south Texas and recognized a pre tax gain of approximately $61.2 million. These properties contributed 2.8 Bcfe to Questar E&P net production in 2008. Major Questar E&P Operating Areas Midcontinent Questar E&P Midcontinent properties are distributed over a large area, including the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, the Arkoma Basin of Oklahoma and western Arkansas, and the Ark La Tex region of Arkansas and Louisiana. With the exception of northwest Louisiana, the Granite Wash play in the Texas Panhandle and the Woodford Shale "Cana" play in western Oklahoma, Questar E&P Midcontinent leasehold interests are fragmented, with no significant concentration of property interests. In aggregate, Midcontinent properties comprised 1,100.5 Bcfe or 40% of Questar E&P total proved reserves at December 31, 2009. Questar E&P has approximately 46,000 net acres of Haynesville Shale lease rights in northwest Louisiana. The true vertical depth to the top of the Haynesville Shale ranges from approximately 10,500 feet to 12,500 feet across Questar E&Ps leasehold and is below the Hosston and Cotton Valley formations that Questar E&P has been developing in northwest Louisiana for over a decade. Questar E&P continues infill development drilling in the Cotton Valley and Hosston formations in northwest Louisiana and intends to drill or participate in up to 48 (operated and non operated) horizontal Haynesville Shale wells in 2010. As of December 31, 2009, Questar E&P had seven operated rigs drilling in the project area and operated or had working interests in 31 Haynesville formation wells and 610 total producing wells in northwest Louisiana compared to six Haynesville formation wells and 539 total producing wells at December 31, 2008. Questar E&P has approximately 26,000 net acres of Woodford Shale lease rights in Blaine, Caddo and Canadian Counties in western Oklahoma. The true vertical depth to the top of the Woodford Shale ranges from approximately 11,000 feet to 14,000 feet across Questar E&Ps leasehold. Questar E&P intends to drill or participate in up to 44 horizontal Woodford Shale wells in 2010. As of December 31, 2009, Questar E&P had one operated rig drilling in the project area and operated or had working interests in 49 producing Woodford Shale wells in western Oklahoma compared to 13 at December 31, 2008. Questar E&P has over 25,000 net acres of Granite Wash lease rights in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma and has been drilling vertical Granite Wash wells in the Texas Panhandle for over a decade. In the past year, other operators have drilled several successful horizontal wells in the Granite Wash Play. The true vertical depth to the top of the Granite Wash interval ranges from approximately 11,100 feet to 15,900 feet across Questar E&Ps leasehold. As of December 31, 2009, Questar E&P had one rig drilling horizontal Granite Wash wells in the Texas Panhandle and had working interests in 10 producing horizontal Granite Wash wells in the Texas Panhandle or Washita County, Oklahoma compared to four wells at December 31, 2008. Questar E&P intends to drill or participate in up to 21 horizontal Granite Wash wells in 2010. Pinedale Anticline As of December 31, 2009, Market Resources (including both Questar E&P and Wexpro) operated and had working interests in 427 producing wells on the Pinedale Anticline compared to 331 at December 31, 2008. Of the 427 producing wells, Questar E&P has working interests in 405 wells, overriding royalty interests in an additional 21 Wexpro operated wells, and no interest in one well operated by Wexpro. Wexpro has working interests in 126 of the 427 producing wells. Questar Market Resources 2009 Form 10 K 20 In 2005, the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (WOGCC) approved 10 acre density drilling for Lance Pool wells on about 12,700 acres of Market Resources 17,872 acre (gross) Pinedale leasehold. The area approved for increased density corresponds to the currently estimated productive limits of Market Resources core acreage in the field. In January 2008, the WOGCC approved five acre density drilling for Lance Pool wells on about 4,200 gross acres of Market Resources Pinedale leasehold. The true vertical depth to the top of the Lance Pool tight gas sand reservoir interval ranges from 8,500 to 9,500 feet across Market Resources acreage. At December 31, 2009, Questar E&P had booked 432 proved undeveloped locations on a combination of 5 , 10 and 20 acre density and reported estimated net proved reserves at Pinedale of 1,300.7 Bcfe, or 47% of Questar E&P total proved reserves. The Company continues to evaluate development on five acre density at Pinedale. If five acre density development is appropriate for a majority of its leasehold, the Company currently estimates that up to 1,400 additional wells will be required to fully develop the Lance Pool on its acreage. Uinta Basin As of December 31, 2009, Questar E&P had an operating interest in 2,334 gross producing wells in the Uinta Basin of eastern Utah, compared to 909 at December 31, 2008. The significant increase in well count was due to the inclusion of Questar E&P acreage within the outside operated Greater Monument Butte enhanced recovery unit in 2009; resulting in Questar E&P having a very small interest in 1,313 wells. At December 31, 2009, Questar E&P had booked nine proved undeveloped locations and reported estimated net proved reserves in the Uinta Basin of 197.7 Bcfe or 7% of Questar E&P total proved reserves. Uinta Basin reserves declined 24% due to lower average 2009 gas and oil prices and a price related slow down in development drilling. Uinta Basin proved reserves are found in a series of vertically stacked, laterally discontinuous reservoirs at depths of 5,000 feet to deeper than 18,000 feet. Questar E&P owns interests in over 244,000 net leasehold acres in the Uinta Basin. Rockies Legacy The remainder of Questar E&P Rocky Mountain region leasehold interests, productive wells and proved reserves are distributed over a number of fields and properties managed as the Companys Rockies Legacy division. Most of the properties are located in the Greater Green River Basin of western Wyoming. In aggregate, Rockies Legacy properties comprised 148.0 Bcfe or 6% of Questar E&P total proved reserves at December 31, 2009. Exploration and development activity for 2010 includes wells in the San Juan, Paradox, Powder River, Green River, Vermillion and Williston Basins. Questar E&P has approximately 80,000 net acres of Bakken formation lease rights in Mountrail, McLean and McKenzie counties in North Dakota. The true vertical depth to the top of the Bakken formation ranges from approximately 9,500 feet to 10,000 feet across Questar E&Ps leasehold. The Three Forks Sanish formation lies approximately 60 70 feet below the middle Bakken formation and is also a target for horizontal drilling. Questar E&P intends to drill or participate in 20 25 horizontal Bakken or Three Forks Sanish wells in 2010. As of December 31, 2009, Questar E&P had one operated rig drilling in the project area and operated or had working interests in 26 producing Bakken or Three Forks Sanish wells in North Dakota compared to 15 at December 31, 2008. Wexpro Wexpro reported net income of $80.7 million in 2009 compared to $73.9 million in 2008, a 9% increase and $59.2 million in 2007. Wexpro 2009 results benefited from a higher average investment base compared to the prior year period. Pursuant to the Wexpro Agreement, Wexpro recovers its costs and receives an unlevered after tax return of approximately 19 20% on its investment base. Wexpros investment base is its investment in commercial wells and related facilities adjusted for working capital and reduced for deferred income taxes and depreciation. Wexpros investment base totaled $431.9 million at December 31, 2009, an increase of $21.3 million or 5% since December 31, 2008. Wexpro produced 48.2 Bcf of cost of service gas in 2009. MIDSTREAM FIELD SERVICES Questar Gas Management Gas Management reported net income of $69.4 million in 2009 compared to $81.5 million in 2008, a 15% decrease and $55.3 million in 2007. Net income was impacted by lower processing margins. Following is a summary of Gas Management financial and operating results: Year Ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 (in millions) Operating Income REVENUES Processing $104.5 $137.0 $ 94.9 ($32.5) $ 42.1 Gathering 127.3 121.0 94.0 6.3 27.0 Questar Market Resources 2009 Form 10 K 21 Other gathering 32.8 32.2 17.4 0.6 14.8 Total Revenues 264.6 290.2 206.3 (25.6) 83.9 OPERATING EXPENSES Operating and maintenance 75.0 95.0 83.6 (20.0) 11.4 General and administrative 25.0 23.7 17.2 1.3 6.5 Production and other taxes 4.6 2.6 1.4 2.0 1.2 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 44.3 28.7 19.1 15.6 9.6 Abandonment and impairments 0.8 0.4 (0.8) 0.4 Total Operating Expenses 148.9 150.8 121.7 (1.9) 29.1 Net loss from asset sales (0.1) (0.1) Operating Income $115.6 $139.4 $ 84.6 ($23.8) $ 54.8 Operating Statistics Natural gas processing volumes NGL sales (MMgal) 101.6 89.5 76.5 12.1 13.0 NGL sales price (per gal) $0.71 $1.18 $0.98 ($0.47) $0.20 Fee based processing volumes (in millions of MMBtu) For unaffiliated customers 102.4 87.4 44.1 15.0 43.3 For affiliated customers 107.6 114.1 82.5 (6.5) 31.6 Total Fee Based Processing Volumes 210.0 201.5 126.6 8.5 74.9 Fee based processing (per MMBtu) $0.15 $0.14 $0.15 $0.01 ($0.01) Natural gas gathering volumes (in millions of MMBtu) For unaffiliated customers 247.1 224.0 162.1 23.1 61.9 For affiliated customers 166.7 168.5 128.1 (1.8) 40.4 Total Gas Gathering Volumes 413.8 392.5 290.2 21.3 102.3 Gas gathering revenue (per MMBtu) $0.31 $0.31 $0.32 ($0.01) Processing margin (processing revenue minus plant operating and maintenance expense, which includes processing plant shrink) in 2009 decreased 15% to $66.1 million compared to $78.1 million in 2008. Fee based gas processing volumes were 210.0 million MMBtu in 2009, a 4% increase compared to 2008. In 2009, fee based gas processing revenues increased 12% or $3.4 million, while the frac spread from keep whole processing decreased 24% or $13.5 million. Approximately 81% of Gas Managements net operating revenue (revenue minus processing plant shrink) in 2009 was derived from fee based contracts, up from 75% in 2008. Gas Management may use forward sales contracts to reduce margin volatility associated with keep whole contracts. Forward sales contracts had no impact in 2009 and reduced NGL revenues by $1.4 million in 2008. Gathering margin (gathering revenue minus gathering operating and maintenance expense) in 2009 increased 5% to $123.5 million compared to $117.1 million in 2008. Expanding Pinedale production and new projects serving third parties in the Uinta Basin contributed to a 10% increase in third party volumes in 2009. Gathering volumes increased 21.3 million MMBtu, or 5% to 413.8 million MMBtu in 2009. Rendezvous was consolidated with Gas Management beginning in 2008. Rendezvous provides gas gathering services for the Pinedale and Jonah producing areas of Wyoming. ENERGY MARKETING Questar Energy Trading Energy Trading net income was $8.5 million in 2009, a decrease of 62% compared to 2008 net income of $22.1 million and 2007 net income of $20.8 million as a result of lower marketing and storage margins. Revenues from unaffiliated customers were $425.6 million in 2009 compared to $608.1 million in 2008, a 30% decrease, primarily the result of lower natural gas prices. The weighted average natural gas sales price decreased 48% in 2009 to $3.29 per MMBtu, compared to $6.34 per MMBtu in 2008. Questar Market Resources 2009 Form 10 K 22 Consolidated Results below Operating Income Interest and Other Income Interest and other income decreased $7.6 million in 2009 compared with 2008 due to less activity in sales of inventory. Interest and other income increased $4.9 million or 51% in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily from gains on inventory sales. Income from unconsolidated affiliates Income from unconsolidated affiliates was $2.7 million in 2009 compared to $1.7 million in 2008 and $8.9 million in 2007. Rendezvous Gas Services, which represented the majority of income from unconsolidated affiliates in 2007, was consolidated beginning in 2008. Realized and unrealized gain (loss) on basis only swaps The Company has used basis only swaps to manage the risk of widening basis differentials. Basis only swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting. As of December 31, 2009, all of the Companys basis only swaps were paired with fixed price swaps and re designated as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments subsequent to the re designation were recorded in Accumulative Other Comprehensive Income. Fair value changes occurring prior to re designation were recorded in income. The Company recognized unrealized mark to market losses of $164.0 million in 2009, $79.2 million in 2008 and $5.7 million gain in 2007. The Company realized losses of $25.6 million on settlements of basis only swaps in 2009. Interest expense Interest expense rose 13% in 2009 compared with 2008 and 75% in 2008 compared to 2007 due primarily to permanent financing activities associated with the purchase of natural gas development properties in northwest Louisiana. Interest rates on Questars commercial paper borrowings in 2009 averaged less than 1% per annum after reaching the highest level in recent years in September 2008. Income taxes The effective combined federal and state income tax rate was 35.6% in 2009 compared with 35.3% in 2008 and 36.4% in 2007. Investing Activities Capital spending in 2009 amounted to $1,314.6 million. The details of capital expenditures in 2009 and 2008 and a forecast for 2010 are shown in the table below: Year Ended December 31, 2010 Forecast 2009 2008 (in millions) Questar E&P $ 873.6 $1,108.6 $1,777.3 Wexpro 100.0 116.2 143.8 Gas Management 289.0 88.3 357.9 Other 1.2 1.5 1.5 Total capital expenditures $1,263.8 $1,314.6 $2,280.5 Questar E&P and Wexpro Questar E&P capital expenditures decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 due to lower property acquisitions in 2009 and a commodity price constrained drilling program in 2009. In February 2008, Questar E&P acquired natural gas development properties in northwest Louisiana for an aggregate purchase price of $652.1 million. During 2009, Questar E&P and Wexpro participated in 437 wells (197.6 net), resulting in 193.6 net successful gas and oil wells and 4.0 net dry or abandoned wells. The 2009 net drilling success rate was 98.0%. There were 116 gross wells in progress at year end. Questar Gas Management Market Resources also increased investment in its midstream gathering and processing services business to expand capacity in both western Wyoming and eastern Utah in anticipation of growing production volumes.

Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Assumptions Market Resources significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report. The Companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported results of operations and financial position. The following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment on the part of management. Gas and Oil Reserves Gas and oil reserve estimates require significant judgments in the evaluation of all available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given field may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, production history, and economic assumptions relating to commodity prices, production costs, severance and other taxes, capital expenditures and remediation costs. The subjective judgments and variances in data for various fields make these estimates less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for more information on the Companys estimated proved reserves. Successful Efforts Accounting for Gas and Oil Operations The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for gas and oil property acquisitions, exploration, development and production activities. Under this method, the acquisition costs of proved and unproved properties, successful exploratory wells and development wells are capitalized. Other exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs, the delay rental and administrative costs associated with unproved property and unsuccessful exploratory well costs are expensed. Costs to operate and maintain wells and field equipment are expensed as incurred. The capitalized costs of unproved properties are generally combined and amortized over the expected holding period for such properties. Individually significant unproved properties are periodically reviewed for impairment. Capitalized costs of unproved properties are reclassified as proved property when related proved reserves are determined or charged against the impairment allowance when abandoned. Capitalized proved property acquisition costs are amortized by field using the unit of production method based on proved reserves. Capitalized exploratory well and development costs are amortized similarly by field based on proved developed reserves. The calculation takes into consideration estimated future equipment dismantlement, surface restoration and property abandonment costs, net of estimated equipment salvage values. Other property and equipment are generally depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives or the unit of production method for certain processing plants. A gain or loss is generally recognized only when an entire field is sold or abandoned, or if the unit of production amortization rate would be significantly affected. Questar Market Resources 2009 Form 10 K 24 Questar E&P engages an independent reservoir engineering consultant to prepare estimates of the proved gas and oil reserves. Reserve estimates are based on a complex and highly interpretive process that is subject to continuous revision as additional production and development drilling information becomes available. Long lived assets are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated on a field by field basis. Impairment is indicated when a triggering event occurs and the sum of estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of the evaluated asset is less than the assets carrying value. The asset value is written down to estimated fair value, which is determined using discounted future net cash flows. Accounting for Derivative Contracts The Company uses derivative contracts, typically fixed price swaps and costless collars, to hedge against a decline in the realized prices of its gas and oil production. Accounting rules for derivatives require marking these instruments to fair value at the balance sheet reporting date. The change in fair value is reported either in net income or Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) depending on the structure of the derivative. The Company has historically structured substantially all energy derivative instruments as cash flow hedges as defined in ASC 815 "Derivatives and Hedging." Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded on the balance sheet and in AOCI until the underlying gas or oil is produced. When a derivative is terminated before its contract expires, the associated gain or loss is recognized in income over the life of the previously hedged production. Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized in the period that services are provided or products are delivered. Questar E&P uses the sales method of accounting whereby revenue is recognized for all gas, oil and NGL sold to purchasers. Revenues include estimates for the two most recent months using published commodity price indexes and volumes supplied by field operators. A liability is recorded to the extent that Questar E&P has an imbalance in excess of its share of remaining reserves in an underlying property. Energy Trading presents revenues on a gross revenue basis. Energy Trading does not engage in speculative hedging transactions, nor does it buy and sell energy contracts with the objective of generating profits on short term differences in prices. Recent Accounting Developments Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for a discussion of the SECs "Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting," which amends the disclosures for oil and gas producers. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Market Resources primary market risk exposure arises from changes in the market price for natural gas, oil and NGL, and volatility in interest rates. Energy Trading has long term contracts for pipeline capacity and is obligated to pay for transportation services with no guarantee that it will be able to fully utilize the contractual capacity of these transportation commitments. Commodity Price Risk Management Market Resources subsidiaries use commodity price derivative instruments in the normal course of business to reduce the risk of adverse commodity price movements. However, these same arrangements typically limit future gains from favorable price movements. Derivative contracts are currently in place for a significant share of Questar E&P owned gas and oil production and a portion of Energy Trading gas marketing transactions. As of December 31, 2009, Market Resources held commodity price derivative contracts for 409.6 million MMBtu of natural gas and 2.7 million barrels of oil. A year earlier Market Resources held derivative contracts for 234.4 million MMBtu of natural gas, 0.7 million barrels of oil and natural gas basis only swaps on an additional 204.9 Bcf. A table of the Market Resources derivative positions for equity production as of December 31, 2009, is shown below: Cash flow Basis only Hedges Swaps Total (in millions) Net fair value of gas and oil derivative contracts outstanding at Dec. 31, 2008 $543.6 ($75.5) $468.1 Contracts realized or otherwise settled (431.2) 14.7 (416.5) Change in gas and oil prices on futures markets (300.7) 60.8 (239.9) Contracts added 87.4 87.4 Questar Market Resources 2009 Form 10 K 25 Contracts re designated as fixed price swaps 239.4 (239.4) Net Fair Value Of Gas and Oil Derivative Contracts Outstanding at Dec. 31, 2009 $138.5 ($239.4) ($100.9) A table of the net fair value of gas and oil derivative contracts as of December 31, 2009, is shown below. Cash flow hedges representing 72% of the net fair value will settle in the next 12 months and will be reclassified from AOCI: Cash flow Basis only Hedges Swaps Total (in millions) Contracts maturing by Dec. 31, 2010 $100.2 ($121.7) ($21.5) Contracts maturing between Jan. 1, 2011 and Dec. 31, 2011 21.6 (117.7) (96.1) Contracts maturing between Jan. 1, 2012 and Dec. 31, 2012 9.3 9.3 Contracts maturing between Jan. 1, 2013 and Dec. 31, 2013 7.4 7.4 Net Fair Value Of Gas and Oil Derivative Contracts Outstanding at Dec. 31, 2009 $138.5 ($239.4) ($100.9) The following table shows the sensitivity of fair value of gas and oil derivative contracts and basis only swaps to changes in the market price of gas and oil and basis differentials: At December 31, 2009 2008 (in millions) Net fair value asset (liability) ($100.9) $468.1 Value if market prices of gas and oil and basis differentials decline by 10% 174.2 590.4 Value if market prices of gas and oil and basis differentials increase by 10% (375.8) 345.9 Credit Risk Market Resources requests credit support and, in some cases, prepayment from companies that pose unfavorable credit risks. Market Resources five largest customers are Sempra Energy Trading Corp., Chevron USA Inc., Enterprise Products Operating, Texla Energy Management Inc. and BP Energy Company. Sales to these companies accounted for 23% of Market Resources revenues before elimination of intercompany transactions in 2009, and their accounts were current at December 31, 2009. Interest Rate Risk The fair value of fixed rate debt is subject to change as interest rates fluctuate. The Companys ability to borrow and the rates quoted by lenders can be adversely affected by the illiquid credit markets as described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The Company had $1,148.7 million of fixed rate long term debt with a fair value of $1,194.1 million at December 31, 2009. A year earlier the Company had $849.1 million of fixed rate long term debt with a fair value of $730.9 million. If interest rates had declined 10%, fair value would increase to $1,236.0 million in 2009 and $767.8 million in 2008. The fair value calculations do not represent the cost to retire the debt securities. Climate Change Risk Federal and state courts and administrative agencies are considering the scope and scale of climate change regulation under various laws pertaining to the environment, energy use and development, and greenhouse gas emissions. Market Resources ability to access and develop new natural gas reserves may be restricted by climate change regulation. There are bills pending in Congress that would regulate greenhouse gas emissions through a cap and trade system under which emitters would be required to buy allowances for offsets of emissions of greenhouse gases. The EPA has adopted final regulations for the measurement and reporting of greenhouse gases emitted from certain large facilities (25,000 tons/year of CO2 equivalent) beginning with operations in 2010. The first report is to be filed with the EPA by March 31, 2011. In addition, several of the states in which Market Resources operates are considering various greenhouse gas registration and reduction programs. Carbon dioxide r egulation could increase the price of natural gas, restrict access to or the use of natural gas, and or reduce natural gas demand. Federal, state and local governments may also pass laws mandating the use of alternative energy sources, such as wind power and solar energy, which may reduce demand for natural gas. While future climate change regulation is likely, it is too early to predict how this regulation will affect Market Resources business, operations or financial results. It is uncertain whether Market Resources operations and properties, located in the Rocky Mountain and Midcontinent regions of the United States, are exposed to possible Questar Market Resources 2009 Form 10 K 26 physical risks, such as severe weather patterns, due to climate change as a result of man made greenhouse gases. However, management does not believe that such physical risks are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations.
