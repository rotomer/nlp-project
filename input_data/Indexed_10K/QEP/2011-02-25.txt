ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to provide a reader of the financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect the results. MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The following information updates the discussion of QEPs financial condition provided in its 2009 Form 10 K filing, and analyzes the changes in the results of operations between the years ended December 31, 2010 versus December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2009 versus December 31, 2008. OVERVIEW QEP Resources, Inc. (QEP or the Company), is an independent natural gas and oil exploration and production company. QEP is a holding company with three major lines of business gas and oil exploration and production, midstream field services, and energy marketing which are conducted through three principal subsidiaries: QEP Energy Company (QEP Energy) acquires, explores for, develops and produces natural gas, oil, and natural gas liquids (NGL); QEP Field Services Company (QEP Field Services) provides midstream field services including natural gas gathering, processing and treating services for affiliates and third parties; and QEP Marketing Company (QEP Marketing) markets equity and third party natural gas and oil, provides risk management services, and owns and operates an underground gas storage reservoir. Highlights QEPs net income increased 11% in 2010 compared with 2009 due to unrealized mark to market gains on basis only swaps, higher production, higher net realized crude oil and NGL prices and higher gathering and processing margins at QEP Field Services, partially offset by lower net realized natural gas prices. QEP reported record production of 229.0 Bcfe in 2010 and all divisions, other than the Uinta Basin, recorded production that was greater than in 2009. Year end proved reserves increased by 10% over the prior year to 3.03 Tcfe. On June 30, 2010, all of the shares of common stock of QEP were distributed through a tax free, pro rata dividend to Questar shareholders. Each Questar shareholder received one share of QEP common stock for each share of Questar common stock held (including fractional shares). In conjunction with the Spin off, QEP distributed the common stock of its wholly owned subsidiary, Wexpro, to Questar. In addition, Questar contributed $250.0 million of equity to QEP prior to the Spin off. In the third quarter of 2010, QEP completed the refinancing of senior notes that were tendered to the Company as a result of the Spin off. In total, QEP purchased $638.0 million principal amount of senior notes using proceeds from its term loan and revolving credit facilities. In August, QEP issued $625.0 million principal amount of senior notes due 2021 to refinance a portion of the indebtedness under its revolving credit facility and all the outstanding indebtedness under the term loan and terminated all of the commitments under the term loan. At December 31, 2010, QEP had five issues of senior notes totaling $1,137.0 million principal amount outstanding compared to $1,150.0 million principal amount outstanding at June 30, 2010. 30 Table of Contents Strategies We create value for our shareholders through returns focused growth, superior execution, and a low cost structure. To achieve these objectives we will strive to: Attract and retain the best people Allocate capital to the projects that generate the best returns Maintain a sustainable inventory of low cost, high margin resource plays Be in the best parts of the best plays Build contiguous acreage positions to drive efficiencies Be the operator of our assets whenever possible Be the low cost driller and producer in each area where we operate Own and operate midstream infrastructure in our core producing areas to control our future and capture value downstream of the wellhead Build gas processing plants to extract liquids from our gas streams Gather, compress and treat our production to drive down costs Actively market our equity production to maximize value Utilize commodities derivatives to hedge against a decline in the realized prices of our natural gas and oil production and lock in acceptable cash flows to support future capital expenditures Operate in a safe and environmentally responsible manner Maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility that allows us to take advantage of both organic growth and acquisition opportunities RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Following are comparisons of net income from continuing operations attributable to QEP by line of business: Year Ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 (in millions, except per share amounts) QEP Energy $ 203.9 $ 134.9 $ 408.0 $ 69.0 $ (273.1 ) QEP Field Services 91.1 69.4 81.5 21.7 (12.1 ) QEP Marketing and other 6.7 8.5 22.1 (1.8 ) (13.6 ) Certain costs of separation and early extinguishment of debt (18.7 ) (18.7 ) Net income from continuing operations attributable to QEP $ 283.0 $ 212.8 $ 511.6 $ 70.2 $ (298.8 ) Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations $ 1.60 $ 1.21 $ 2.90 $ 0.39 $ (1.69 ) Average diluted shares 177.3 176.3 176.1 1.0 0.2 31 Table of Contents QEP ENERGY QEP Energy reported net income of $203.9 million in 2010, an increase of 51% from $134.9 million in 2009, but lower than 2008 net income of $408.0 million when natural gas prices were significantly higher. Unrealized mark to market gains on natural gas basis only swaps, higher production of 229.0 Bcfe and higher net realized crude oil and NGL prices were the main drivers for this increase. These factors were partially offset by lower net realized natural gas prices. Unrealized mark to market gains and losses on natural gas basis only swaps increased pre tax income $121.7 million in 2010 compared to a net pre tax loss of $164.0 million for these items in 2009. Net gains from sales of assets increased pre tax income by $13.7 million in 2010 compared to a net pre tax gain of $1.6 million in 2009.

On an energy equivalent basis, natural gas comprised approximately 89% of 2010 production. A summary of natural gas equivalent production by major operating area is shown in the following table: Year Ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 QEP Energy production by operating area (in Bcfe) Midcontinent 120.4 87.8 67.8 32.6 20.0 Pinedale Anticline 68.5 61.8 56.8 6.7 5.0 Uinta Basin 21.4 23.2 26.9 (1.8 ) (3.7 ) Rockies Legacy 18.7 16.7 19.9 2.0 (3.2 ) Total production 229.0 189.5 171.4 39.5 18.1 QEP Energy production volumes Natural gas (Bcf) 203.8 168.7 151.9 35.1 16.8 Oil and NGL (MMbbl) 4.2 3.5 3.3 0.7 0.2 Total production (Bcfe) 229.0 189.5 171.4 39.5 18.1 Average daily production (MMcfe) 627.4 519.1 468.3 108.3 50.8 Net production in the Midcontinent grew 37% to 120.4 Bcfe in 2010 compared to 87.8 Bcfe in 2009. Midcontinent production growth was driven by the ongoing development drilling in the Haynesville Shale play in Elm Grove, Thorn Lake and Woodardville fields in northwest Louisiana, continued development of the Granite Wash/Atoka play in the Texas Panhandle, and the Woodford Cana Shale horizontal gas play in the Anadarko Basin of western Oklahoma. Net production from the Pinedale Anticline in western Wyoming grew 11% to 68.5 Bcfe in 2010 as a result of ongoing development drilling. Historically, seasonal access restrictions imposed by the Bureau of Land Management have limited the ability to drill and complete wells at Pinedale during the mid November to early May period. In September 2008, the BLM issued a Record of Decision (ROD) on the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for long term development of natural gas resources in the Pinedale Anticline Project Area (PAPA). Under the ROD, QEP Energy is allowed to drill and complete wells year round in one of the five Concentrated Development Areas defined in the PAPA. The ROD contains additional requirements and restrictions on development of the PAPA. In the Uinta Basin, net production decreased 8% to 21.4 Bcfe in 2010. Production volumes were adversely impacted by decreased drilling activity in response to low natural gas prices. Rockies Legacy net production in 2010 increased 12% to 18.7 Bcfe, 2.0 Bcfe higher than the year ago period due to increased drilling activity in the Bakken play in North Dakota. QEP Energy Rockies Legacy properties include all Rocky Mountain region properties except the Pinedale Anticline and the Uinta Basin. 33 Table of Contents Pricing Realized prices for natural gas at QEP Energy were lower in 2010 than in 2009 and 2008, while 2010 realized oil and NGL prices were higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008. A regional comparison of QEP Energys average realized prices, including the impact of hedges, are shown in the following table: Year Ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Natural gas (per Mcf) Midcontinent $ 5.85 $ 7.01 $ 8.63 $ (1.16 ) $ (1.62 ) Rocky Mountains 4.73 6.12 6.85 (1.39 ) (0.73 ) Volume weighted average 5.33 6.54 7.56 (1.21 ) (1.02 ) Oil and NGL (per bbl) Midcontinent $ 50.63 $ 46.05 $ 72.82 $ 4.58 $ (26.77 ) Rocky Mountains 61.09 45.82 73.05 15.27 (27.23 ) Volume weighted average 56.80 45.91 72.96 10.89 (27.05 ) A comparison of net realized average natural gas prices, including realized losses on basis only swaps which did not qualify for hedge accounting and are therefore not included in revenue, are shown in the following table.

(2) Reported below operating income in the consolidated income statement. Realized losses on basis only swaps of $121.7 million in 2010 and $25.6 million in 2009 are reported after operating income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 34 Table of Contents Commodity Derivatives Impact The impact of QEPs commodity derivative transactions on the Companys financial statements is presented below. The net effect of the portion of natural gas basis only swaps that do not qualify for hedge accounting is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income below operating income. Derivative positions as of December 31, 2010, are summarized in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K.

As of December 31, 2009, all of the Companys basis only swaps had been paired with NYMEX gas fixed price swaps or price collars and re designated as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments subsequent to their re designation were recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), however, changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments occurring prior to their re designation were recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Operating Expenses In 2010, QEP Energy operating expenses (the sum of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, lease operating expense, general and administrative expense, allocated interest expense and production taxes) per Mcfe of production decreased 5% to $4.17 per Mcfe versus $4.39 per Mcfe in 2009. Operating expenses are summarized in the following table: Year Ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 (per Mcfe) Depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 2.59 $ 2.71 $ 1.93 $ (0.12 ) $ 0.78 Lease operating expenses 0.56 0.67 0.73 (0.11 ) (0.06 ) General and administrative expense 0.34 0.36 0.33 (0.02 ) 0.03 Allocated interest expense 0.34 0.34 0.34 Production taxes 0.34 0.31 0.61 0.03 (0.30 ) Total Operating expenses $ 4.17 $ 4.39 $ 3.94 $ (0.22 ) $ 0.45 35 Table of Contents In 2010, production volume weighted per unit depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense decreased compared to 2009 primarily as a result of increased proved reserves related to higher field level natural gas and oil prices compared to a year ago. Lease operating expenses per Mcfe were lower primarily due to higher production volumes combined with flat operating expenses. General and administrative expenses per Mcfe were slightly lower as a result of increased production volumes partially offset by higher expenses. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to higher labor, benefits and stock based compensation expenses. Allocated interest expense per Mcfe of production was unchanged. Production taxes per Mcfe increased slightly in 2010 as the result of higher field level natural gas and oil sales prices. In most states, the Company pays production taxes based on a percentage of field level sales prices. Exploration expense decreased $2.0 million or 8% in 2010 compared to 2009, despite an $8.7 million charge associated with an unsuccessful exploratory well drilled on the Borie Niobrara prospect in southeastern Wyoming. The overall decrease was due to lower geological, geophysical and other exploratory expenses in 2010 compared with 2009. Abandonment and impairment expense increased $25.8 million or 127% in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase is primarily due to higher impairment costs associated with our unproven acreage, which we amortize on a straight line basis over the primary term of the lease. A significant amount of costs associated with such leases were added in 2009. Additionally, a $7.6 million impairment of an acreage block associated with the Borie Niobrara exploratory well discussed above contributed to this increase. Other Items QEP Energy completed the sale of properties located in Arkansas, Mississippi and other non core locations and recognized a pre tax gain of $13.7 million during the third quarter of 2010. Major Operating Areas Midcontinent QEP Energys Midcontinent properties are distributed over a large area, including the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, the Arkoma Basin of Oklahoma and western Arkansas, and the Ark La Tex region of Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas. Excluding northwest Louisiana, the Granite Wash/Atoka Wash play in the Texas Panhandle and the Woodford Shale Cana play in western Oklahoma, QEP Energy Midcontinent leasehold interests are fragmented, with no significant concentration of property interests. In aggregate, Midcontinent properties contributed 120.4 Bcfe or 53% of 2010 production and comprised 1,170.5 Bcfe or 39% of QEP Energy total proved reserves at December 31, 2010. QEP Energy has approximately 49,600 net acres of Haynesville Shale lease rights in northwest Louisiana. The true vertical depth to the top of the Haynesville Shale ranges from approximately 10,500 feet to 12,500 feet across QEP Energys leasehold. The Haynesville Shale underlies the Hosston and Cotton Valley formations that QEP Energy has been developing in northwest Louisiana for over a decade. QEP Energy continues drilling in the Haynesville Shale and intends to drill or participate in up to 80 gross (operated and non operated) horizontal Haynesville Shale wells in 2011 compared to 86 gross wells in 2010. As of December 31, 2010, QEP Energy had six operated rigs drilling in the project area and had working interests in 121 gross Haynesville Formation wells and a total of 716 gross producing wells in northwest Louisiana compared to 31 gross Haynesville Formation wells and a total of 610 gross producing wells at December 31, 2009. QEP Energy has approximately 68,000 net acres of Woodford Shale lease rights in western Oklahoma. The true vertical depth to the top of the Woodford Shale ranges from approximately 10,500 feet to 14,500 feet across QEP Energys leasehold. QEP Energy intends to drill or participate in up to 64 gross horizontal Woodford Shale wells in 2011 compared to 54 gross wells in 2010. As of December 31, 2010, QEP Energy had two operated rigs drilling in the project area and had working interests in 102 gross producing Woodford Shale wells in western Oklahoma compared to 49 gross wells at December 31, 2009. 36 Table of Contents QEP Energy has approximately 41,000 net acres of Granite Wash/Atoka Wash lease rights in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma and has been drilling vertical Granite Wash/Atoka Wash wells for over a decade. In the past year, QEP and other operators have drilled a number of successful horizontal wells in the Granite Wash/Atoka Wash play. The true vertical depth to the top of the Granite Wash/Atoka Wash interval ranges from approximately 11,100 feet to 15,900 feet across QEP Energys leasehold. As of December 31, 2010, QEP Energy had three rigs drilling horizontal Granite Wash/Atoka Wash wells in the Texas Panhandle and had working interests in 48 gross producing horizontal Granite Wash/Atoka Wash wells in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma compared to 15 gross wells at December 31, 2009. QEP Energy intends to drill or participate in up to 35 gross horizontal Granite Wash/Atoka Wash wells in 2011 compared to 33 gross wells in 2010. Pinedale Anticline As of December 31, 2010, QEP Energy had working interests in 529 gross producing wells on the Pinedale Anticline compared to 426 gross wells at December 31, 2009. Of the 529 gross producing wells, QEP Energy has working interests in 508 wells and overriding royalty interests in an additional 21 wells. The Pinedale Anticline contributed 68.5 Bcfe or 30% of QEP Energy 2010 production and comprised 1,348.9 Bcfe or 44% of QEP Energy total proved reserves at December 31, 2010. In 2005, the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (WOGCC) approved 10 acre density drilling for Lance Pool wells on about 12,700 acres of QEP Energys 17,872 acre (gross) Pinedale leasehold. The area approved for increased density corresponds to the currently estimated productive limits of QEP Energy core acreage in the field. In January 2008, the WOGCC approved five acre density drilling for Lance Pool wells on about 4,200 gross acres of QEP Energys Pinedale leasehold. The true vertical depth to the top of the Lance Pool tight gas sand reservoir interval ranges from 8,500 to 9,500 feet across QEP Energys acreage. If five acre density development is appropriate for a majority of its leasehold, the Company currently estimates that up to 1,300 additional wells will be required to fully develop the Lance Pool on its acreage. Uinta Basin As of December 31, 2010, QEP Energy had a working interest in 2,098 gross producing wells in the Uinta Basin of eastern Utah, compared to 2,334 gross wells at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010, properties in the Uinta Basin contributed 21.4 Bcfe or 9% of 2010 production and comprised 212.8 Bcfe or 7% of QEP Energy total proved reserves at December 31, 2010. Uinta Basin proved reserves are found in a series of vertically stacked, laterally discontinuous reservoirs at depths of 5,000 feet to deeper than 18,000 feet. QEP Energy owns interests in approximately 290,000 net leasehold acres in the Uinta Basin. Rockies Legacy The remainder of QEP Energy Rocky Mountain region leasehold interests, productive wells and proved reserves are distributed over a number of fields and properties managed as the Companys Rockies Legacy division. Most of the properties are located in the Greater Green River Basin of western Wyoming. In aggregate, Rockies Legacy properties contributed 18.7 Bcfe or 8% of 2010 production and comprised 298.5 Bcfe or 10% of QEP Energy total proved reserves at December 31, 2010. Exploration and development activity for 2011 includes wells in the Powder River, Greater Green River and Williston Basins. QEP Energy has approximately 90,000 net acres of lease rights in the Williston Basin in western North Dakota where the company is targeting the Bakken and Three Forks formations. The true vertical depth to the top of the Bakken Formation ranges from approximately 9,500 feet to 10,000 feet across QEP Energys leasehold. The Three Forks Formation lies approximately 60 to 70 feet below the Middle Bakken Formation and is also a target for horizontal drilling. QEP Energy intends to drill or participate in 53 gross Bakken or Three Forks horizontal wells in 2011 compared to 29 gross wells in 2010. As of December 31, 2010, QEP Energy had two operated rigs drilling in the project area and had working interests in 55 gross producing Bakken or Three Forks wells in North Dakota compared to working interests in 26 gross wells at December 31, 2009. 37 Table of Contents QEP FIELD SERVICES QEP Field Services activities reported net income of $91.1 million in 2010 compared to $69.4 million in 2009, a 31% increase. QEP Field Services net income was $81.5 million in 2008. Net income increased in 2010 due to improved gathering margins driven by higher gathering volumes and higher processing margins. Net income decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 as the result of decreased processing margins and increased depreciation expense. Following is a summary of QEP Field Services financial and operating results: Year Ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 (in millions) QEP Field Services Operating Income REVENUES NGL sales $ 94.8 $ 71.9 $ 106.0 $ 22.9 $ (34.1 ) Processing 35.2 32.6 31.0 2.6 1.6 Gathering 152.5 127.3 121.0 25.2 6.3 Other gathering 36.7 32.8 32.2 3.9 0.6 Total Revenues 319.2 264.6 290.2 54.6 (25.6 ) OPERATING EXPENSES Processing 11.9 10.3 10.2 1.6 0.1 Processing plant shrinkage 32.6 28.1 48.7 4.5 (20.6 ) Gathering 37.6 36.6 36.1 1.0 0.5 General and administrative 31.6 25.0 23.7 6.6 1.3 Property taxes 4.4 4.6 2.6 (0.2 ) 2.0 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 48.9 44.3 28.7 4.6 15.6 Abandonment and impairments 0.8 (0.8 ) Total Operating Expenses 167.0 148.9 150.8 18.1 (1.9 ) Net loss from asset sales (1.6 ) (0.1 ) (1.5 ) (0.1 ) Operating Income 150.6 115.6 139.4 35.0 (23.8 ) Interest and other income 0.1 (0.2 ) 0.3 (0.2 ) Income from unconsolidated affiliates 2.8 2.6 1.2 0.2 1.4 Interest expense (7.6 ) (6.0 ) (3.6 ) (1.6 ) (2.4 ) INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES 145.9 112.0 137.0 33.9 (25.0 ) Income taxes (51.9 ) (40.0 ) (46.5 ) (11.9 ) 6.5 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS 94.0 72.0 90.5 22.0 (18.5 ) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest (2.9 ) (2.6 ) (9.0 ) (0.3 ) 6.4 NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO QEP FIELD SERVICES $ 91.1 $ 69.4 $ 81.5 $ 21.7 $ (12.1 ) Depreciation expense increased $4.6 million during 2010 compared with 2009 due to the addition of new facilities. Approximately 78% of Field Services 2010 net operating revenue was derived from fee based contracts, compared to 82% in 2009. Gathering The primary driver of increased gathering margin (gathering revenue minus gathering expense) in 2010 was the transfer of the northwest Louisiana gathering system assets from QEP Energy to QEP Field Services in January 2010. The transfer of the northwest Louisiana gathering system is also the driver for the increase in system throughput volume along with increased drilling activity within the Haynesville Shale. Gathering margins also increased at the Black Fork Hub reflecting growing Pinedale production volumes and declining operating expenses. 38 Table of Contents Following is a summary of QEP Field Services gathering related financial and operating results: Year Ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 (in millions) Gathering Margin Gathering $ 152.5 $ 127.3 $ 121.0 $ 25.2 $ 6.3 Other gathering 36.7 32.8 32.2 3.9 0.6 Gathering (expense) (37.6 ) (36.6 ) (36.1 ) (1.0 ) (0.5 ) Gathering Margin $ 151.6 $ 123.5 $ 117.1 $ 28.1 $ 6.4 Operating Statistics Natural gas gathering volumes (in millions of MMBtu) For unaffiliated customers 276.8 301.2 278.3 (24.4 ) 22.9 For affiliated customers 198.9 112.6 114.2 86.3 (1.6 ) Total Gas Gathering Volumes 475.7 413.8 392.5 61.9 21.3 Average gas gathering revenue (per MMBtu) $ 0.32 $ 0.31 $ 0.31 $ 0.01 $ Processing Processing margin (processing revenue minus processing expenses and processing plant shrinkage) increased in 2010 compared with 2009 due to improved NGL prices and lower natural gas (shrink) costs. The increase in processing volumes in 2010 was driven by increased throughput at QEP Field Services Stagecoach plant in eastern Utah.

QEP Marketing net income was $22.1 million in 2008. The decreases in 2010 and 2009 were a result of lower marketing and storage margins due to an overall decrease in natural gas price volatility. Revenues from unaffiliated customers were $598.8 million in 2010 compared to $442.5 million in 2009, a 35% increase, the result of higher natural gas prices and increased sales volumes. The weighted average natural gas sales price increased 20% in 2010 to $3.95 per MMBtu, compared to $3.29 per MMBtu in 2009. The gas sales volumes increased 7% in 2010 to 201.9 MMBtu compared to 189.3 MMBtu in 2009. Higher revenue was more than offset by increased cost of gas purchased from third parties that was later resold. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS BELOW OPERATING INCOME Separation costs QEP reported expenses of $13.5 million during 2010 related to the Spin off of QEP Resources, Inc. from Questar Corporation on June 30, 2010. The expenses consisted primarily of QEPs share of certain fees and expenses for financial, legal and tax advisory services and for severance expenses for terminated employees. Loss on early extinguishment of debt QEP reported $13.3 million in losses on early extinguishment of debt in 2010 related to the purchase of $638.0 million principal amount of senior notes and the termination of commitments under the $500.0 million term loan. The purchase of $638.0 million principal amount of senior notes in August 2010 was a result of QEPs offer to purchase the notes related to the Spin off pursuant to the change of control provisions in the senior notes indenture. As a result of the issuance of $625.0 million principal amount of senior notes in August 2010, all the outstanding debt under the term loan was repaid and commitments under the term loan were terminated. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income decreased $2.2 million in 2010 compared with 2009 due primarily to a valuation adjustment on pipe inventory. Interest and other income decreased $5.7 million in 2009 compared with 2008 due to less activity in sales of inventory. Realized and unrealized gain (loss) on basis only swaps In the past, the Company has used basis only swaps to manage the risk of widening basis differentials. Basis only swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting. As of December 31, 2009, all of the Companys basis only swaps had been paired with NYMEX gas fixed price swaps or price collars and re designated as cash flow hedges. Fair value changes occurring prior to re designation were recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments subsequent to the re designation were recorded in AOCI. Upon settlement, the portion of the settlement attributed to the period prior to re designation is reported as an unrealized gain (loss) and offsets prior periods impact on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The Company recognized unrealized gains of $121.7 million in 2010, and unrealized losses of $164.0 million in 2009 and $79.2 million in 2008. The Company realized losses of $121.7 million in 2010 and $25.6 million in 2009 on settlements of basis only swaps, which were reported after operating income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Interest expense Interest expense rose 20% in 2010 compared with 2009 and 14% in 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to financing activities associated with the issuance of the new bonds in 2010, higher interest rates under QEPs amended credit facility, and higher debt levels related to the purchase of natural gas development properties in northwest Louisiana in 2008. 40 Table of Contents Income taxes The Companys effective combined federal and state income tax rate was 36.9% in 2010 compared with 35.3% in 2009 and 2008. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES QEP anticipates that its cash capital expenditures, which were $1,469.0 million in 2010, will be approximately $1,200.0 million in 2011. QEP expects to fund its 2011 capital expenditure budget primarily with cash flow from operations, supplemented with additional sources of liquidity, if needed, including bank financings, and proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and or equity securities. QEPs ability to raise funds in the capital markets will be impacted by its financial condition, interest rates, market conditions, and industry conditions. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased 13% in 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease from 2009 compared to 2008 was 6%. Cash sources from operating assets and liabilities were lower in 2010 primarily due to reductions in accounts receivable during 2009 and a decrease in current federal income taxes payable due to bonus depreciation. Noncash adjustments to net income consisted primarily of depreciation, depletion and amortization, and deferred income taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities is presented below: Year Ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 (in millions) Net income $ 329.1 $ 296.1 $ 594.5 $ 33.0 $ (298.4 ) Noncash adjustments to net income 741.3 782.3 692.6 (41.0 ) 89.7 Changes in operating assets and liabilities (72.9 ) 71.0 (62.4 ) (143.9 ) 133.4 Net cash provided from continuing operating activities $ 997.5 $ 1,149.4 $ 1,224.7 $ (151.9 ) $ (75.3 ) Investing Activities A comparison of capital expenditures, including exploratory dry hole expense, from continuing operations in 2010 and 2009 and a forecast for 2011 are shown in the table below: Year Ended December 31, 2011Forecast 2010 2009 (in millions) QEP Energy $ 1,050.0 $ 1,205.0 $ 1,108.6 QEP Field Services 150.0 262.1 88.3 QEP Marketing and other 1.9 1.5 Total cash capital expenditures from continuing operations $ 1,200.0 1,469.0 1,198.4 Changes in accruals 16.9 (90.0 ) Total accrued capital expenditures from continuing operations $ 1,485.9 $ 1,108.4 Net cash used in investing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows also includes proceeds from the disposition of assets of $25.6 million in 2010 and $14.2 million in 2009, as well as reductions in notes receivable of $52.9 million and $37.8 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. 41 Table of Contents QEP Energy QEP Energy capital expenditures were higher in 2010 compared to 2009 due to an increased drilling program in 2010. The 2010 net drilling success rate was 99.0%. There were 191 gross wells in progress at year end. QEP Field Services QEP Field Services increased investment in its gathering, processing and treating facilities to expand capacity in western Wyoming, eastern Utah and northwest Louisiana. Financing Activities For 2010, net cash used in investing activities of $1,390.5 exceeded net cash provided by operating activities of $997.5 by $393.0 million. During 2010, the Company increased its drilling activities primarily to hold acreage by establishing production on expiring leases. In 2009, as a result of the economic downturn, the Company limited capital expenditures to approximate internally generated cash flow. In 2009, net cash provided by operating activities of $1,149.4 million exceeded net cash used in investing activities of $1,146.4 million by $3.0 million reflecting the strategy. For 2010, long term debt increased by a net change of $123.6 million while short term debt increased by $19.2 million. In 2009, long term debt increased by a net change of $47.0 million and short term debt decreased by a net change of $50.1 million. At December 31, 2010, long term debt consisted of $400.0 million outstanding under QEPs revolving credit facility and $1,130.8 million in senior notes (including $6.1 million of net original issue discount), which includes $58.5 million of senior notes that mature in March 2011. All intercompany loans between Questar and QEP, which have been historically reported as notes payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were repaid on June 30, 2010, in conjunction with the Spin off. QEPs consolidated capital structure consisted of 34% combined short and long term debt and 66% common shareholders equity at December 31, 2010 and 2009. In June 2010, in conjunction with the Spin off, QEP amended its existing revolving credit agreement. The amendment increased the amount of commitments from $800.0 million to $1.0 billion, increased commitment fees, increased the applicable margin used in calculating interest rates and added financial covenants that limit the amount of funded indebtedness the Company may incur, as well as modifying other immaterial provisions of the agreement. In addition, QEP entered into a $500.0 million, 364 day term loan agreement (term loan) with substantially the same initial pricing and terms as its revolving credit agreement. In August 2010, the Company purchased $638.0 million principal amount of its senior notes and paid required premium and accrued interest pursuant to the requirement in the notes indenture relating to a change of control. The Company used cash on hand and proceeds from its $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and $500.0 million term loan to purchase all of the tendered notes. Subsequent to the purchase of the tendered notes, the Company issued $625.0 million principal amount of senior notes due 2021. The notes were issued at a discount, resulting in gross proceeds of $619.2 million which were used to pay fees and expenses associated with the issuance and to refinance a portion of the indebtedness incurred under the term loan and revolving credit facilities to purchase the tendered senior notes. Upon repayment of the term loan, commitments under the term loan were terminated. The Companys senior notes outstanding as of December 31, 2010 totaled $1,137.0 million in principal and are comprised of five issues as follows: $58.5 million 7.50% Senior Notes due March 2011 $176.8 million 6.05% Senior Notes due September 2016 $138.6 million 6.80% Senior Notes due April 2018 $138.0 million 6.80% Senior Notes due March 2020 $625.0 million 6.875% Senior Notes due March 2021 42 Table of Contents At February 18, 2011 QEP had $441.0 million outstanding under its revolving credit facility and $5.6 million of letters of credit issued. At December 31, 2010, accounting for the outstanding letters of credit, QEP had unused capacity of $594.4 million on its revolving credit facility. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commitments In the course of ordinary business activities, QEP enters into a variety of contractual cash obligations and other commitments. The following table summarizes the significant contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2010: Payments Due by Year Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 After2015 (in millions) Long term debt $ 1,536.9 $ 58.5 $ $ 400.0 $ $ $ 1,078.4 Interest on fixed rate long term debt 652.6 73.2 72.5 72.5 72.5 72.5 289.4 Drilling contracts 58.1 54.0 4.1 Transportation contracts 447.6 45.4 45.2 43.6 42.5 42.4 228.5 Operating leases 15.1 5.0 4.5 3.4 1.0 1.1 0.1 Total $ 2,710.3 $ 236.1 $ 126.3 $ 519.5 $ 116.0 $ 116.0 $ 1,596.4 Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Assumptions QEPs significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of its Annual Report. The Companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported results of operations and financial position. The following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment on the part of management. Gas and Oil Reserves Gas and oil reserve estimates require significant judgments in the evaluation of all available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given field may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, production history, economic assumptions relating to commodity prices, operating expenses, severance and other taxes, capital expenditures and remediation costs. The subjective judgments and variances in data for various fields make these estimates less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report on Form 10 K for more information on the Companys estimated proved reserves. Successful Efforts Accounting for Gas and Oil Operations The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for gas and oil property acquisitions, exploration, development and production activities. Under this method, the acquisition costs of proved and unproved properties, successful exploratory wells and development wells are capitalized. Other exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs, the delay rental and administrative costs associated with unproved property and unsuccessful exploratory well costs are expensed. Costs to operate and maintain wells and field equipment are expensed as incurred. The capitalized costs of unproved properties are generally combined and amortized over the expected holding period for such properties. Individually significant unproved properties are periodically reviewed for impairment. Capitalized costs of unproved properties are reclassified as proved property when related proved reserves are determined or charged against the impairment allowance when abandoned. 43 Table of Contents Capitalized proved property acquisition costs are amortized by field using the unit of production method based on proved reserves. Capitalized exploratory well and development costs are amortized similarly by field based on proved developed reserves. The calculation takes into consideration estimated future equipment dismantlement, surface restoration and property abandonment costs, net of estimated equipment salvage values. Other property and equipment are generally depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives or the unit of production method for certain processing plants. A gain or loss is generally recognized only when an entire field is sold or abandoned, or if the unit of production amortization rate would be significantly affected. QEP Energy engages an independent reservoir engineering consultant to prepare estimates of the proved gas and oil reserves. Reserve estimates are based on a complex and highly interpretive process that is subject to continuous revision as additional production and development drilling information becomes available. Long lived assets are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated on a field by field basis. Impairment is indicated when a triggering event occurs and the sum of estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of the evaluated asset is less than the assets carrying value. The asset value is written down to estimated fair value, which is determined using discounted future net cash flows. Accounting for Derivative Contracts The Company uses derivative contracts, typically fixed price swaps and costless collars, to hedge against a decline in the realized prices of its natural gas and oil production. Accounting rules for derivatives require marking these instruments to fair value at the balance sheet reporting date. The change in fair value is reported either in net income or AOCI depending on the structure of the derivative. The Company has historically structured the majority of its energy derivative instruments as cash flow hedges as defined in ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded on the balance sheet and in AOCI until the underlying gas or oil is produced. When a derivative is terminated before its contract expires, the associated gain or loss is recognized in income over the life of the previously hedged production. Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are included as part of operating income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized in the period that services are provided or products are delivered. QEP Energy uses the sales method of accounting whereby revenue is recognized for all gas, oil and NGL sold to purchasers. Revenues include estimates for the two most recent months using published commodity price indexes and volumes supplied by field operators. A liability is recorded to the extent that QEP Energy has an imbalance in excess of its share of remaining reserves in an underlying property. QEP Marketing presents revenues on a gross revenue basis. QEP Marketing does not engage in speculative hedging transactions, nor does it buy and sell energy contracts with the objective of generating profits on short term differences in prices. Recent Accounting Developments There have been no recent accounting pronouncements that were adopted in 2010 or are under consideration that would have a material impact on QEPs results of operations or financial condition. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK QEPs primary market risk exposure arises from changes in the market price for natural gas, oil and NGL, and volatility in interest rates. QEP Energy and QEP Marketing have long term contracts for pipeline capacity and are obligated to pay for transportation services with no guarantee that they will be able to fully utilize the contractual capacity of these transportation commitments. Commodity Price Risk Management QEPs subsidiaries use commodity price derivative instruments in the normal course of business to reduce the risk of adverse commodity price movements. However, these same arrangements typically limit future gains from favorable price movements. As of December 31, 2010, QEP held commodity price derivative contracts for 247.5 million MMBtu of natural gas and 1.1 million barrels of oil. As of December 31, 2009, QEP held derivative contracts for 409.6 million MMBtu of natural gas and 2.7 million barrels of oil. A table reconciling the net fair value of the Companys derivative positions for equity production as of December 31, 2010, is shown below: Cash flowHedges Basis onlySwaps Total (in millions) Net fair value of gas and oil derivative contracts outstanding at Dec. 31, 2009 $ 138.5 $ (239.4 ) $ (100.9 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled (348.2 ) 121.7 (226.5 ) Change in gas and oil prices on futures markets 564.4 564.4 Contracts added 1.5 1.5 Net Fair Value Of Gas and Oil Derivative Contracts Outstanding at Dec. 31, 2010 $ 356.2 $ (117.7 ) $ 238.5 A table of the net fair value of gas and oil derivative contracts that are scheduled to settle over the next three years as of December 31, 2010, is shown below.

The Companys five largest customers are Sempra Energy Trading Corp., Chevron USA Inc., Enterprise Products Operating, Macquarie Energy LLC. and BP Energy Company. Sales to these companies accounted for 27% of QEP revenues before elimination of intercompany transactions in 2010, and their accounts were current at December 31, 2010. Interest Rate Risk The Companys ability to borrow and the rates quoted by lenders can be adversely affected by the illiquid credit markets as described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The Companys credit facility has floating interest rates and as such, exposes QEP to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase 10% over their average 2010 and 2009 levels and at our average level of borrowing for those years, our annualized interest expense would increase by $0.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively, or less than 1% in either year. 46 Table of Contents
