ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to provide the reader of the financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect the Companys operating results. MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The following information updates the discussion of QEPs financial condition provided in its 2010 Form 10 K filing, and analyzes the changes in the results of operations between the years ended December 31, 2011 versus December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2010 versus December 31, 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2011, QEP revised its reporting of transportation and handling costs. Transportation and handling costs, previously netted against revenues, have been recast on the Consolidated Income Statement from revenues to "Natural gas, oil and NGL transportation and other handling costs for all periods presented. The impact of this revision is immaterial to the accompanying financial statements and has no effect on income. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Item 8, Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for additional information. OVERVIEW QEP Resources, Inc. (QEP or the Company) is a holding company with three major lines of business gas and oil exploration and production, midstream field services, and energy marketing which are conducted through three principal subsidiaries: QEP Energy Company (QEP Energy) acquires, explores for, develops and produces natural gas, oil, and NGL; QEP Field Services Company (QEP Field Services) provides midstream field services, including natural gas gathering and processing, compression and treating services, for affiliates and third parties; and QEP Marketing Company (QEP Marketing) markets affiliate and third party natural gas and oil, provides risk management services, and owns and operates an underground gas storage reservoir. Reincorporation Merger and Spin off Effective May 18, 2010, Market Resources, then a wholly owned subsidiary of Questar, merged with and into QEP, a Delaware corporation and a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary of Questar, in order to reincorporate in the State of Delaware. The Reincorporation Merger was effected pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into between Market Resources and QEP. On June 30, 2010, Questar distributed to existing Questar stockholders all of the shares of common stock of QEP in a tax free, pro rata spin off, establishing QEP as an independent, publicly traded company. In connection with the Spin off, QEP distributed Wexpro, a wholly owned subsidiary of QEP at the time, to Questar. In addition, Questar contributed $250.0 million of equity to QEP prior to the Spin off. Outlook The Company has substantial acreage positions and operations in some of North Americas most important hydrocarbon resource plays, including the Bakken/Three Forks, Pinedale, Haynesville and Woodford Cana Shale. These resource plays are characterized by unconventional oil or natural gas accumulations in continuous tight sands or shales that underlie broad geographic areas. The lateral continuity of such resource plays means that aside from wells abandoned due to mechanical issues, the Company does not expect to drill many unsuccessful wells. Resource plays allow the Company the opportunity to gain considerable operational efficiencies through high density and repeatable drilling and completion operations. The Company has a large inventory of lower risk, predictable development drilling locations across its acreage holdings in the onshore United States that provide a solid base for consistent organic production and reserve growth. QEP believes that it has one of the lowest cash cost structures among its exploration and production company peers. However, in certain of its resource plays, the Company has experienced rising completed well costs, which could impact future drilling plans. While predominantly a natural gas producer, the Company has increased its focus on growing the relative proportion of crude oil and NGL production in its exploration and production business. QEP Energy oil and NGL production increased by approximately 54% during the year ended December 31, 2011 to 6,456.9 Mbbl, and oil and NGL revenue accounted for approximately 29% of net production revenues (including realized gains and losses on all settled derivative contracts) during the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to 19% and 12% during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. QEP Energy oil and NGL production increased by approximately 22% during the year ended December 31, 2010 when compared to the 2009 period. The increase in NGL sales volumes during 2011 was a result of the fee based processing agreement entered into with QEP Field Services effective August 1, 2011, shortly after the start up of the Blacks Fork II plant in July 2011 and the liquids recovered for QEP Energy by third party processers associated with development of liquids rich plays in the Midcontinent and in the Bakken/Three Forks formations. The Company has allocated approximately 88% of its forecasted 2012 drilling and completion capital expenditure budget to oil and liquids rich natural gas plays due to current depressed natural gas prices and the natural gas forward price. While QEP believes that it can grow its production and reserves from its extensive inventory of drilling locations, the Company also evaluates acquisition opportunities that might have the potential to create significant long term value. QEP believes that its experience, expertise and substantial presence in the Southern and Northern Regions, combined with its low cost operating structure and financial strength, enhance its ability to pursue acquisition opportunities in those geographic areas. 35 Table of Contents The Company also owns and operates gathering and transmission pipelines and natural gas processing and treatment facilities in many of its core producing areas, which allows the Company to promptly connect its wells, better control its costs, and generate a significant revenue stream by providing gathering and processing services to third parties. Net income from QEPs midstream business accounted for approximately 58% of the Companys total net income from continuing operations attributable to QEP during the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to 32% and 33% during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. QEPs midstream net income as a percentage of total Company net income increased in 2011 due in part to impairment charges at QEP Energy which decreased its share of total Company net income as compared to prior periods. Financial and Operating Results During the year ended December 31, 2011, QEP had strong production growth from QEP Energy, its exploration and production business, and QEP Field Services, its gathering and processing business. Although crude oil and NGL prices decreased in the second half of 2011 from the first half of 2011, QEP Energy benefitted from higher production and higher crude oil and NGL prices during the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the 2010 and 2009 periods. QEP Field Services benefitted during the year ended December 31, 2011, from the Iron Horse plant having three full quarters of operations, the commencement of the Blacks Fork II processing plant in the second half of 2011 and continued robust gas processing margins. During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, QEP Energy reported production of 275.2 Bcfe, 229.0 Bcfe and 189.5 Bcfe, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Southern and Northern Regions contributed 56% and 44%, respectively, of total equivalent production. QEP Energy continues to focus on the controllable cash cost of production per Mcfe. The Company defines cash cost of production as the sum of lease operating expense, general and administrative expense, a portion of total QEP interest expense that is allocated to QEP Energy based on intercompany agreements and production taxes. Cash operating costs for QEP Energy were $1.56 per Mcfe during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $1.58 per Mcfe and $1.68 per Mcfe for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. The decrease was the result of increased production volumes partially offset by higher overall production costs. QEP Energy reported record production of 275.2 Bcfe in 2011 and all divisions, other than the Uinta Basin, recorded production that was greater than in 2010. Year end proved reserves increased by 19% over the prior year to 3.61 Tcfe. QEP Field Services reported gathering system throughput of 1.4 million MMBtu per day during the year ended December 31, 2011, up from 1.3 million MMBtu per day and 1.1 million MMBtu per day for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2011, QEP Field Services reported a 42% increase in NGL sales volumes to a total of 141.8 million gallons. The increase in NGL sales volumes along with a 38% increase in the per unit NGL margin (NGL revenue less fuel and shrinkage and transportation and handling costs) resulted in a 95% increase to the keep whole processing margin during the year ended December 31, 2011. During the first quarter of 2011, QEP Field Services commenced operations of the 150 MMcf per day cryogenic Iron Horse processing plant, an expansion of its Stagecoach processing complex in the Uinta Basin of eastern Utah. This plant predominantly provides fee based processing services to third parties. During the third quarter of 2011, QEP Field Services commissioned the 420 MMcf per day Blacks Fork II cryogenic processing plant, an expansion of its Blacks Fork processing complex located in the Green River Basin of southwestern Wyoming. The Blacks Fork complex is about 100 miles south of QEPs operations at Pinedale. QEP expects that the Blacks Fork II plant at full capacity will be able to extract an incremental net 16,000 Bbls per day of NGL. During the third quarter of 2011, QEP entered into a new revolving credit facility, which matures in August 2016, and replaced the previous $1.0 billion credit facility. The terms of the new credit facility provide for loan commitments of $1.5 billion from a syndicate of financial institutions. The new credit facility provides for borrowings at short term interest rates and contains customary covenants and restrictions. The agreement also contains provisions which would allow for the amount of the facility to be increased to $2.0 billion and for the maturity to be extended for two additional one year periods. During the fourth quarter of 2011, QEP recorded a non cash price related impairment charge of $195.2 million on some of its mature, dry gas, and higher cost properties in both the Northern and Southern Regions. The impairment charge related to the reduced value of these areas resulting from lower natural gas prices and the current forward curve for natural gas prices. The assets were written down to their estimated fair values. Of the $195.2 million impairment charge, $163.5 million were related to properties in the Northern Region with the remaining $31.7 million related to properties in the Southern Region. See Item 8, footnote 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for additional information regarding the impairment. Factors Affecting Results of Operations Oil and Natural Gas Prices Historically, prices received for QEPs natural gas, NGL and crude oil production have been volatile and unpredictable, and that volatility is expected to continue. In recent years, the domestic natural gas supply has grown faster than natural gas demand, driven by advances in technology, including horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, which have allowed producers to extract increasing amounts of natural gas from shale, tight sand formations, and other unconventional reservoirs. Increased natural gas supply has put downward pressure on natural gas prices, while concern about the global economy and other factors has caused the price of crude oil to decrease in the second half of 2011 from the first half of 2011, although they remain higher during the year ended December 31, 2011 than comparable 2010 and 2009 prices. Changes in the market prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGL directly impact many aspects of QEPs business, including its financial condition, revenues, results of operations, liquidity, rate of growth, costs of goods and services required to drill and complete wells, and the carrying value of its oil and natural gas properties. For example, despite a 16% increase in natural gas production during the year ended December 31, 2011, natural gas revenues increased by only 3% due to significantly lower net realized natural gas prices. Similarly, during the year ended December 31, 2010, natural gas production increased 21%, yet natural gas revenues increased by only 2% due to lower net realized natural gas prices. 36 Table of Contents QEP uses commodity derivatives to reduce the variability of the prices QEP receives for a portion of its production and to provide a minimum revenue stream. In general, QEP plans to hedge approximately 50% of its forecasted production by the end of the first quarter of the current year. As of December 31, 2011, QEP Energy had approximately 49% of its forecasted 2012 natural gas, oil and NGL production covered with fixed price swaps or costless collars, assuming 2012 annual production of 307.5 Bcfe. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Commodity Derivative Transactions for further details concerning QEPs commodity derivatives transactions. In addition, as a result of the continued spread between oil and natural gas prices, the Company has allocated approximately 88% of its forecasted 2012 drilling and completion capital expenditure budget to oil and liquids rich natural gas projects in its portfolio. Unrealized Derivative Gains and Losses Unrealized gains and losses that result from mark to market valuations of derivative positions that are not accounted for as cash flow hedges were reflected as unrealized commodity derivative gains or losses in the Companys income statement during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. In addition, the Company has elected to discontinue hedge accounting beginning January 1, 2012 and future unrealized gains and losses that result from mark to market valuations of all derivative positions will be reflected as unrealized commodity derivative gains or losses in the Companys income statement. See Item 8, footnote 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of this annual report on Form 10 K for additional information regarding the discontinuance of hedge accounting. Payments due to or from counterparties in the future on these derivatives will typically be offset by corresponding changes in prices ultimately received from the sale of QEPs production. QEP has incurred significant unrealized gains and losses in prior periods and may continue to incur these types of gains and losses in the future. Blacks Fork II Processing Plant The completion and start up of the new Blacks Fork II processing plant resulted in increased NGL production in QEP Field Services and QEP Energy in 2011. As part of the agreement, QEP Energy and QEP Field Services recorded line pack for the NGL line fill requirements which is recorded as inventory on each of the respective companys balance sheet at December 31, 2011. In conjunction with the start up of the Blacks Fork II plant, QEP Energy entered into a fee based processing agreement with QEP Field Services to process QEP Energys share of Pinedale gas. As a result, about 46% of the NGL recovered at the Blacks Fork II plant will be accounted for as NGL production in QEP Energy, with about 40% included in the keep whole volumes in QEP Field Services. The remaining 14% relates to non QEP royalty volumes. Global Economy and the European Debt Crisis QEP remains hopeful for a continued recovery of the global economy, however, continues to monitor the outlook of the global economy, including the European debt crisis and its potential impact on global economic growth and the banking and financial sectors, the United States federal budget deficit, and commodity prices. QEP expects natural gas prices to remain low in the United States if the natural gas drilling rig counts remain near current levels, natural gas storage remains high and natural gas production continues to grow. QEP expects oil prices to remain at or above current levels if the global economy continues its recovery. Disruption to the global oil supply system or other factors, could trigger oil price volatility with sharp increases in the crude oil price that could be followed by sharp declines in the price the Company may receive for its oil production. Because of the global economic outlook and the uncertainty around the commodity pricing environment, QEP continues to plan its capital spending program and financial flexibility appropriately. Potential for Future Asset Impairments The United States natural gas market remains weak. A further decrease in forward natural gas prices during 2012 could result in additional impairment charges. Certain of the Companys properties have significant natural gas reserves and therefore are sensitive to declines in natural gas prices. These assets are at risk of impairment if future NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas prices experience further decline. The cash flow model that the Company uses to assess proved properties for impairment includes numerous assumptions, such as managements estimates of future oil and gas production, market outlook on forward commodity prices, operating and development costs, and discount rates. All inputs to the cash flow model must be evaluated at each date of estimate. However, a decrease in forward natural gas prices alone could result in an impairment of properties that are sensitive to declines in natural gas prices. A significant drop in oil prices could also trigger impairment. For additional information see Item 1A Risk Factors and see Item 8. Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies. 37 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Income QEP Resources net income from continuing operations attributable to QEP in 2011 was $267.2 million or $1.50 per diluted share, compared to $283.0 million or $1.60 per diluted share in 2010. The decrease in 2011 was due to the $99.2 million, or 49%, decline in QEP Energys net income, partially offset by a $63.4 million, or 70%, increase in QEP Field Services net income. QEP Energys net income declined in 2011 because of a non cash, price related impairment charge of $195.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 on some of its mature, dry gas, and higher cost properties in both the Northern and Southern Regions. Offsetting the decline at QEP Energy, QEP Field Services increase in net income was driven by higher gathering and processing margins and increased throughput volumes. QEP Resources net income from continuing operations attributable to QEP in 2010 was $70.2 million, or 33% higher than the 2009 period. The increase in 2010 net income was primarily driven by increased net income at both QEP Energy and QEP Field Services. QEP Energys 2010 increase in net income was the result of higher production and higher net realized crude oil and NGL prices in 2010, partially offset by lower net realized natural gas prices. QEP Field Services 2010 increase in net income was due to higher gathering and processing margins and increased throughput volumes. Following are comparisons of net income from continuing operations attributable to QEP by line of business: Year ended December 31, Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (in millions) QEP Energy $ 104.7 $ 203.9 $ 134.9 $ (99.2 ) $ 69.0 QEP Field Services 154.5 91.1 69.4 63.4 21.7 QEP Marketing and other 8.4 6.7 8.5 1.7 (1.8 ) QEP Resources (0.4 ) (18.7 ) 18.3 (18.7 ) Net income from continuing operations attributable to QEP $ 267.2 $ 283.0 $ 212.8 $ (15.8 ) $ 70.2 Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations $ 1.50 $ 1.60 $ 1.21 $ (0.10 ) $ 0.39 Average diluted shares 178.4 177.3 176.3 1.1 1.0 Adjusted EBITDA Management believes Adjusted EBITDA (a non GAAP measure) is an important measure of the Companys cash flow and liquidity and an important measure for comparing the Companys financial performance to other gas and oil producing companies. Management defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income before the following items: depreciation, depletion and amortization, abandonment and impairment, interest and other income, interest expense, separation costs, loss on early extinguishment of debt, income taxes, unrealized gain and losses on basis only swaps, discontinued operations, gains and losses from assets sales, and exploration expense. During the year ended December 31, 2011, QEP revised its reporting of transportation and handling costs to align with industry practice and GAAP. This revised disclosure does not change current or prior period disclosure of net income and Adjusted EBITDA. For additional information, see Item 8, Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies for additional details. Following are comparisons of Adjusted EBITDA by line of business: Year Ended December 31, Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (in millions) QEP Energy $ 1,057.5 $ 926.2 $ 988.0 $ 131.3 $ (61.8 ) QEP Field Services 320.3 203.9 162.6 116.4 41.3 QEP Marketing and other 8.8 10.4 14.9 (1.6 ) (4.5 ) Total Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,386.6 $ 1,140.5 $ 1,165.5 $ 246.1 $ (25.0 ) Adjusted EBITDA increased 22% to $1,386.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $1,140.5 million in the 2010 period, despite an 11% decrease in net realized natural gas prices. The impact of lower net realized natural gas prices during the year ended December 31, 2011 was offset by a 20% increase in total production, 30% higher net realized crude oil prices and 22% higher net realized NGL prices in QEP Energy, along with increased gathering margins (22% higher) and processing margins (93% higher) in QEP Field Services. Adjusted EBITDA decreased only 2% during the year ended December 31, 2010 from the $1,165.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, despite a decrease in net realized natural gas prices of 23%. The large decrease in natural gas prices in the 2010 period compared to the 2009 period was offset by a 21% increase in total production, 29% higher net realized crude oil prices and 23% higher net NGL prices in QEP Energy. During the year ended December 31, 2010, QEP Field Services gathering margins increased 23% and processing margins increased 29% from the year ended December 31, 2009. 38 Table of Contents A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income follows: Year Ended December 31, Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (in millions) Net income attributable to QEP Resources $ 267.2 $ 326.2 $ 293.5 $ (59.0 ) $ 32.7 Net income attributable to non controlling interest 3.2 2.9 2.6 0.3 0.3 Net income 270.4 329.1 296.1 (58.7 ) 33.0 Discontinued operations, net of tax (43.2 ) (80.7 ) 43.2 37.5 Income from continuing operations 270.4 285.9 215.4 (15.5 ) 70.5 Unrealized gain on basis only swaps (117.7 ) (121.7 ) 164.0 4.0 (285.7 ) Net gain from asset sales (1.4 ) (12.1 ) (1.5 ) 10.7 (10.6 ) Interest and other loss (income) (4.1 ) (2.3 ) (4.5 ) (1.8 ) 2.2 Income taxes 154.4 167.0 117.6 (12.6 ) 49.4 Interest expense 90.0 84.4 70.1 5.6 14.3 Separation costs 13.5 (13.5 ) 13.5 Loss on early extinguishment of debt 0.7 13.3 (12.6 ) 13.3 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 765.4 643.4 559.1 122.0 84.3 Abandonment and impairment 218.4 46.1 20.3 172.3 25.8 Exploration expenses 10.5 23.0 25.0 (12.5 ) (2.0 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,386.6 $ 1,140.5 $ 1,165.5 $ 246.1 $ (25.0 ) Revenue, Volumes and Prices Year ended December 31, Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (in millions) Revenues Natural gas sales $ 1,239.1 $ 1,205.3 $ 1,187.2 $ 33.8 $ 18.1 Oil sales 324.2 198.1 141.3 126.1 56.8 NGL sales 129.7 47.9 22.5 81.8 25.4 Gathering, processing and other 380.9 251.3 218.4 129.6 32.9 Purchased gas and oil sales 1,085.3 598.0 441.8 487.3 156.2 Total Revenues $ 3,159.2 $ 2,300.6 $ 2,011.2 $ 858.6 $ 289.4 39 Table of Contents QEP Energys revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, resulting from the sale of natural gas, oil and NGLs increased primarily due to increased production volumes and higher oil and NGL prices, offset by lower prices for natural gas, as follows: Year ended December 31, 2011 Natural Gas Oil NGLs Total (in millions) QEP Energy Revenues 2010 revenues $ 1,205.3 $ 198.1 $ 47.9 $ 1,451.3 Changes associated with volumes (1) 193.2 50.7 58.1 302.0 Changes associated with prices (2) (159.4 ) 75.4 23.7 (60.3 ) 2011 revenues $ 1,239.1 $ 324.2 $ 129.7 $ 1,693.0 Year ended December 31, 2010 Natural Gas Oil NGLs Total (in millions) QEP Energy Revenues 2009 revenues $ 1,187.2 $ 141.3 $ 22.5 $ 1,351.0 Changes associated with volumes (1) 246.5 12.1 16.6 275.2 Changes associated with prices (2) (228.4 ) 44.7 8.8 (174.9 ) 2010 revenues $ 1,205.3 $ 198.1 $ 47.9 $ 1,451.3 (1) The revenue variance attributed to the change in volume is calculated by multiplying the change in volumes from the year ended December 31, 2011 or 2010, to the year ended December 31, 2010 or 2009, by the average realized price or fee for the year ended December 31, 2010 or 2009. (2) The revenue variance attributed to the change in price is calculated by multiplying the change in realized prices or fee from the year ended December 31, 2011 or 2010, to the year ended December 31, 2010 or 2009, by volume for the year ended December 31, 2010 or 2009. QEP Field Services revenues also increased for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, as a result of higher volumes, improved processing and gathering fees in 2011 as compared to 2010, and higher gathering and processing volumes, and higher NGL prices and gathering fees in 2010 as compared to 2009, as follows: For the year ended December 31, 2011 NGLs Processing Gathering Total (in millions) QEP Field Services 2010 revenues $ 94.8 $ 35.2 $ 189.2 $ 319.2 Changes associated with volumes (1) 39.3 2.3 7.8 49.4 Changes associated with fees (2) 45.9 18.4 32.6 96.9 2011 revenues $ 180.0 $ 55.9 $ 229.6 $ 465.5 For the year ended December 31, 2010 NGLs Processing Gathering Total (in millions) QEP Field Services 2009 revenues $ 71.9 $ 32.6 $ 160.1 $ 264.6 Changes associated with volumes (1) (1.0 ) 2.6 24.0 25.6 Changes associated with fees (2) 23.9 5.1 29.0 2010 revenues $ 94.8 $ 35.2 $ 189.2 $ 319.2 (1) The revenue variance attributed to the change in volume is calculated by multiplying the change in volumes from the year ended December 31, 2011 or 2010, to the year ended December 31, 2010 or 2009, by the average realized price or fee for the year ended December 31, 2010 or 2009. (2) The revenue variance attributed to the change in fees is calculated by multiplying the change in realized prices or fee from the year ended December 31, 2011 or 2010, to the year ended December 31, 2010 or 2009, by volume for the year ended December 31, 2010 or 2009. 40 Table of Contents Purchased gas and oil sales increased by $487.3 million, or 81% during the year ended December 31, 2011 from 2010. The increase in 2011 was primarily due to QEP Energys additional revenues of $509.8 million related to gas purchases made in northwest Louisiana to utilize firm transportation capacity and the subsequent sale of those gas purchases. Purchased gas and oil sales increased $156.2 million, or 35%, during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The 2010 increase was the result of higher natural gas prices and increased sales volumes at QEP Marketing. Reserves QEP Energys proved reserves in major operating areas at December 31, 2011 and 2010 are summarized below: 2011 2010 (Bcfe) (% of total) (Bcfe) (% of total) Southern Region Haynesville/Cotton Valley 782.9 22 728.3 24 Midcontinent 518.7 14 442.2 15 Northern Region Pinedale Anticline 1,531.0 42 1,348.9 44 Uinta Basin 393.6 11 212.8 7 Rockies Legacy 387.6 11 298.5 10 Total QEP Energy 3,613.8 100 3,030.7 100 Production QEP Energy reported production of 275.2 Bcfe during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 229.0 Bcfe and 189.5 Bcfe for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. On an energy equivalent basis, crude oil and NGL comprised approximately 14% of QEP Energys total production for the year ended December 31, 2011, up from 11% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. A summary of production is shown in the following table: For the year ended December 31, Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 QEP Energy production volumes Natural gas (Bcf) 236.4 203.8 168.7 32.6 35.1 Oil (Mbbl) 3,741.3 2,979.8 2,746.7 761.5 233.1 NGL (Mbbl) 2,715.6 1,225.8 705.0 1,489.8 520.8 Total production (Bcfe) 275.2 229.0 189.5 46.2 39.5 Average daily production (MMcfe) 753.9 627.4 519.1 126.5 108.3 A summary of natural gas production by major geographical area is shown in the following table: For the year ended December 31, Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 QEP Energy Natural gas (Bcf) Southern Region Haynesville/Cotton Valley 107.1 79.3 46.9 27.8 32.4 Midcontinent 32.9 30.8 32.7 2.1 (1.9 ) Northern Region Pinedale Anticline 69.3 65.1 58.9 4.2 6.2 Uinta Basin 14.9 14.9 16.7 (1.8 ) Rockies Legacy 12.2 13.7 13.5 (1.5 ) 0.2 Total production 236.4 203.8 168.7 32.6 35.1 41 Table of Contents A summary of oil production by major geographical area is shown in the following table: For the year ended December 31, Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 QEP Energy Oil (Mbbl) Southern Region Haynesville/Cotton Valley 51.0 78.4 121.1 (27.4 ) (42.7 ) Midcontinent 835.3 644.3 775.1 191.0 (130.8 ) Northern Region Pinedale Anticline 583.8 551.8 486.9 32.0 64.9 Uinta Basin 866.7 957.1 930.7 (90.4 ) 26.4 Rockies Legacy 1,404.5 748.2 432.9 656.3 315.3 Total production 3,741.3 2,979.8 2,746.7 761.5 233.1 A summary of NGL production by major geographical area is shown in the following table: For the year ended December 31, Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 QEP Energy NGL (Mbbl) Southern Region Haynesville/Cotton Valley 8.4 5.5 3.3 2.9 2.2 Midcontinent 1,371.2 997.0 456.1 374.2 540.9 Northern Region Pinedale Anticline 1,099.6 1,099.6 Uinta Basin 106.4 121.5 151.2 (15.1 ) (29.7 ) Rockies Legacy 130.0 101.8 94.4 28.2 7.4 Total production 2,715.6 1,225.8 705.0 1,489.8 520.8 A summary of natural gas equivalent total production by major geographical area is shown in the following table: For the year ended December 31, Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 QEP Energy Total Production (Bcfe) Southern Region Haynesville/Cotton Valley 107.5 79.8 47.7 27.7 32.1 Midcontinent 46.2 40.6 40.1 5.6 0.5 Northern Region Pinedale Anticline 79.4 68.5 61.8 10.9 6.7 Uinta Basin 20.8 21.4 23.2 (0.6 ) (1.8 ) Rockies Legacy 21.3 18.7 16.7 2.6 2.0 Total production 275.2 229.0 189.5 46.2 39.5 Southern Region Haynesville/Cotton Valley. Net production in the Haynesville/Cotton Valley area grew 35% to 107.5 Bcfe during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 and represented 39% of the Companys total production. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, Haynesville/Cotton Valley production was 79.8 Bcfe and 47.7 Bcfe, respectively, which represented 35% and 25% of the Companys total production. Haynesville/Cotton Valley area production growth was driven by development drilling in the Haynesville Shale play in northwest Louisiana. Southern Region Midcontinent. Net production in the Midcontinent area grew 14% to 46.2 Bcfe during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 and represented 17% of the Companys total production. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, Midcontinent area production was 40.6 Bcfe and 40.1 Bcfe, respectively, which represented 18% and 21% of the Companys total production. Midcontinent area production growth was driven by continued development of the Granite Wash/Atoka Wash play in the Texas Panhandle and the Woodford Cana Shale horizontal gas play in the Anadarko Basin of western Oklahoma. Northern Region Pinedale Anticline. Net production from the Pinedale Anticline in western Wyoming grew 16% to 79.4 Bcfe during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 and represented 29% of the Companys total production. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, Pinedale Anticline production was 68.5 Bcfe and 61.8 Bcfe, respectively, which represented 30% and 33% of the Companys total production. As a result of a new fee based processing agreement between QEP Energy and QEP Field Services at Blacks Fork II, NGL production at Pinedale for the second half of 2011 was 1,099.6 Mbbl, contrasted with no reportable NGL production in the comparable 2010 and 2009 periods. 42 Table of Contents Northern Region Uinta Basin. In the Uinta Basin, production decreased 3% during the year ended December 31, 2011, due to decreased drilling activity, despite a first quarter 2011 prior period adjustment of QEPs ownership interest within a federal unit, which resulted in a positive adjustment to reported volumes of 1.6 Bcfe. During the year ended December 31, 2010, Uinta production was 1.8 Bcfe lower than in 2009 due to decreased drilling activity resulting from low natural gas prices. Northern Region Rockies Legacy. Rockies Legacy net production in 2011 increased by 14% to 21.3 Bcfe. Rockies Legacy production in 2010 was 2.0 Bcfe higher than in 2009. Increases in both 2011 and 2010 were due to increased oil directed drilling activity in the North Dakota Bakken/Three Forks play. Most of QEPs wells in North Dakota have been connected to oil gathering lines during 2011, thereby eliminating future weather related oil sales interruptions. QEP Energy Rockies Legacy properties include all Northern Region properties except the Pinedale Anticline and the Uinta Basin. Pricing During the year ended December 31, 2011, QEP revised its reporting of transportation and handling costs. Transportation and handling costs have been recast on the Consolidated Income Statement from revenues to Natural gas, oil and NGL transportation and other handling costs for all periods presented. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Item 8, Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for additional information. Field level and realized prices (after the impact of all settled commodity derivatives) for natural gas at QEP Energy were lower during the year ended December 31, 2011 than in the 2010 and 2009 comparable periods, while 2011 realized oil and NGL prices were higher than in 2010 and 2009. A regional comparison of QEP Energys average field level prices are shown in the following tables: Year Ended December 31, Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 QEP Energy Average field level natural gas price (per Mcf) Southern Region $ 4.00 $ 4.24 $ 3.69 $ (0.24 ) $ 0.55 Northern Region 3.87 4.11 3.30 (0.24 ) 0.81 Average field level natural gas price 3.95 4.18 3.48 (0.23 ) 0.70 Year Ended December 31, Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 QEP Energy Average field level oil price (per bbl) Southern Region $ 90.45 $ 74.93 $ 54.41 $ 15.52 $ 20.52 Northern Region 84.88 67.62 49.17 17.26 18.45 Average field level oil price 86.20 69.39 50.88 16.81 18.51 Year Ended December 31, Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 QEP Energy Average field level NGL price (per bbl) Southern Region $ 43.66 $ 35.57 $ 27.15 $ 8.09 $ 8.42 Northern Region 52.00 54.62 40.56 (2.62 ) 14.06 Average field level NGL price 47.76 39.04 31.82 8.72 7.22 A comparison of net realized average natural gas, oil and NGL prices, including the realized losses on basis only swaps, which did not qualify for hedge accounting and are therefore not included in revenue, are shown in the following table.

During 2009, the change in unrealized gains and losses on natural gas basis only swaps decreased net income by $103.3 million. As of December 31, 2009, all of the Companys basis only swaps had been paired with NYMEX gas fixed price swaps or price collars and re designated as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments subsequent to their re designation were recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), however, changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments occurring prior to their re designation were recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Gathering QEP Field Services posted a 22% increase in gathering margin during the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to an increase in the NGL value received from a short term, third party processing arrangement for certain volumes in the Northern Region and a 3% increase in the average gathering rate. During the year ended December 31, 2010, gathering margin increased by $28.1 million due to the transfer of the northwest Louisiana gathering system assets from QEP Energy to QEP Field Services, which increased system throughput volume along with increased drilling activity in the Haynesville/Cotton Valley and Pinedale Anticline plays. Gathering system throughput volume was 1.4 million MMBtu per day for the year ended December 31, 2011, up from the 1.3 million MMBtu per day and 1.1 million MMBtu per day during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. The increased volumes in 2011 and 2010 were mainly related to the northwest Louisiana gathering system, as described above, which accounted for 21%, and 16% of the total throughput during the years ended December 31, 2011, and 2010, respectively. 44 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2011, QEP contracted for 200 million cubic feet per day of gas to a third party cryogenic processing plant on an interruptible basis, reported in QEP Field Services as Other gathering revenues. QEP expects Other gathering revenues to diminish and to be replaced by keep whole processing revenues in QEP Field Services and NGL revenues in QEP Energy. Following is a summary of QEP Field Services financial and operating results from gathering activities: Year Ended December 31, Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Gathering Margin Gathering revenues $ 161.1 $ 152.5 $ 127.3 $ 8.6 $ 25.2 Other gathering revenues 68.5 36.7 32.8 31.8 3.9 Gathering expense (44.6 ) (37.6 ) (36.6 ) (7.0 ) (1.0 ) Gathering margin $ 185.0 $ 151.6 $ 123.5 $ 33.4 $ 28.1 Operating Statistics Natural gas gathering volumes (in millions of MMBtu) For unaffiliated customers 261.2 276.8 301.2 (15.6 ) (24.4 ) For affiliated customers 234.2 198.9 112.6 35.3 86.3 Total Gas Gathering Volumes 495.4 475.7 413.8 19.7 61.9 Average gas gathering revenue (per MMBtu) $ 0.33 $ 0.32 $ 0.31 $ 0.01 $ 0.01 Processing Although a significant portion of the QEP Field Services gas processing services are performed for a volumetric based fee, a portion of its gas processing agreements result in commodity price exposure. Such agreements are referred to as keep whole processing agreements, whereby the Company has the right to extract NGL recovered at its processing plants and the obligation to replace the Btu equivalent value of such NGL with dry natural gas (the shrink). Under these agreements, the Company is exposed to the spread between NGL prices and natural gas prices. Processing margin increased 93% during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, due to increased keep whole processing margins and fee based processing volumes and lower natural gas prices. The increased keep whole processing margin was mostly the result of increased NGL prices and volume. NGL prices increased 34% and NGL volumes increased 42% during the year ended December 31, 2011. Fee based processing revenues increased 53% during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010, due to an 6% increase in fee based processing volumes to 240.7 million MMBtu and a 38% increase in the processing fee rate. The increased processing volume was primarily the result of the start up of the 150 MMcf per day Iron Horse cryogenic processing plant in the Uinta Basin of eastern Utah during the first quarter of 2011 and the start up of the Blacks Fork II plant in the third quarter of 2011. Approximately 70%, 78% and 82% of QEP Field Services net operating revenue was derived from fee based gathering and processing agreements during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. The decline in the relative percentage of fee based revenues was due primarily to the increase in keep whole processing margins in 2011. Processing margin increased in 2010 compared with 2009 by $19.4 million due to improved NGL prices and lower natural gas costs. The 16.2 million MMBtu increase in fee based processing volumes in 2010 was driven by increased throughput at QEP Field Services Stagecoach plant in eastern Utah. 45 Table of Contents Frac spread, as used in the following table, is defined as the difference between the market value for NGL extracted from the natural gas stream and the market value of the Btu equivalent volume of natural gas required to replace the extracted liquids and the related transportation and handling costs. Following is a summary of QEP Field Services processing financial and operating results: Year Ended December 31, Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Processing Margin NGL sales $ 180.0 $ 94.8 $ 71.9 $ 85.2 $ 22.9 Processing (fee based) revenues 53.7 35.2 32.4 18.5 2.8 Other processing fees 2.2 0.2 2.2 (0.2 ) Processing (expense) (12.2 ) (11.9 ) (10.3 ) (0.3 ) (1.6 ) Processing plant fuel and shrinkage (expense) (49.2 ) (32.6 ) (28.1 ) (16.6 ) (4.5 ) Natural gas, oil and NGL transportation and other handling costs (9.3 ) (9.3 ) Processing margin $ 165.2 $ 85.5 $ 66.1 $ 79.7 $ 19.4 Frac spread (NGL sales less processing plant fuel and shrinkage less natural gas, oil and NGL transportation and other handling costs) $ 121.5 $ 62.2 $ 43.8 $ 59.3 $ 18.4 Operating Statistics Natural gas processing volumes NGL sales (MMgal) 141.8 100.2 101.6 41.6 (1.4 ) Average NGL sales price (per gal) $ 1.27 $ 0.95 $ 0.71 $ 0.32 $ 0.24 Fee based processing volumes (in millions of MMBtu) For unaffiliated customers 122.9 116.8 110.6 6.1 6.2 For affiliated customers 117.8 109.4 99.4 8.4 10.0 Total fee based processing volumes 240.7 226.2 210.0 14.5 16.2 Average fee based processing revenue (per MMBtu) $ 0.22 $ 0.16 $ 0.15 $ 0.06 $ 0.01 Operating Expenses The following table presents QEPs total operating expenses and the changes from previous reporting periods for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. The narrative following the below table explains the significant variances between the comparable periods. For the year ended December 31, Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (in millions) Purchased gas and oil expense $ 1,077.1 $ 589.3 $ 427.8 $ 487.8 $ 161.5 Lease operating expense 145.2 125.0 125.5 20.2 (0.5 ) Natural gas, oil and NGL transportation and other handling costs 102.2 54.2 38.7 48.0 15.5 Gathering, processing and other 107.3 83.2 76.2 24.1 7.0 General and administrative 123.2 107.2 91.7 16.0 15.5 Separation costs 13.5 (13.5 ) 13.5 Production and property taxes 105.4 82.5 62.9 22.9 19.6 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 765.4 643.4 559.1 122.0 84.3 Exploration expenses 10.5 23.0 25.0 (12.5 ) (2.0 ) Abandonment and impairment 218.4 46.1 20.3 172.3 25.8 Total operating expenses $ 2,654.7 $ 1,767.4 $ 1,427.2 $ 887.3 $ 340.2 Purchased gas and oil expense increased in 2011 due to increased purchased gas expense at QEP Energy of $506.4 million. The increased purchased gas expense at QEP Energy relates to gas purchases made in northwest Louisiana to utilize firm transportation capacity. Purchased gas and oil expense increased $161.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, due to higher oil and NGL prices and increased volumes. Lease operating expense increased $20.2 million, or 16% to $145.2 million, during 2011 compared to 2010, driven by a 20% increase in production of natural gas and oil and NGL equivalents during the period. Lease operating expense during 2010 compared to 2009 was essentially flat, despite an increase in production due to the increase in Haynesville and Pinedale volumes, which have lower lease operating expenses. 46 Table of Contents Natural gas, oil and NGL transportation and other handling costs increased $48.0 million, due primarily to processing costs associated with increased NGL production and related transportation costs under a revised processing agreement at Pinedale. Natural gas, oil and NGL transportation and other handling costs increased $15.5 million in 2010 compared to 2009, due primarily to increased natural gas production and related transportation costs at Haynesville/Cotton Valley area. See Item 8, Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for a discussion of the recasting of transportation and other handling costs. Gathering, processing and other expense increased by $24.1 million due to higher gathering and processing volumes in 2011 when compared to the 2010 period. Gathering, processing and other expense increased by $7.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 also due to higher gathering and processing volumes. Total QEP general and administrative (G&A) expense increased to $123.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared with $107.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in 2011 resulted from an increase in the number of employees, increased employee benefit plan and stock based compensation related expenses, increased legal and outside professional services and higher insurance costs. QEP total G&A expense increased by $15.5 million, or 17%, during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The 2010 increases primarily related to higher labor, benefits and stock based compensation expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2010, QEP reported separation costs of $13.5 million, respectively, related to the Spin off of QEP Resources, Inc. from Questar Corporation on June 30, 2010. The expenses consisted primarily of QEPs share of certain fees and expenses for financial, legal and tax advisory services and for severance expenses for terminated employees. There were no separation costs in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2009. Higher natural gas, oil and NGL production and higher field level oil and NGL prices, resulted in higher total production and property taxes during the year ended December 31, 2011, partially offset by lower field level sales prices for natural gas during the same period. Production and property taxes were higher during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 as the result of higher field level natural gas and oil sales prices. QEPs total depreciation, depletion and amortization expense grew $122.0 million, or 19%, in 2011 from the 2010 comparable period, as a result of increased production at QEP Energy combined with plant additions at QEP Field Services. During the year ended December 31, 2010, QEPs total depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased to $643.4 million from the $559.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, due to increased capital spending at both QEP Energy and QEP Field Services and increased production at QEP Energy. Exploration expenses were $10.5 million in 2011 compared to $23.0 million in 2010, due to a decrease in dry hole costs of $9.3 million and reduced seismic acquisition costs of $2.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2010, exploration expenses decreased by $2.0 million, or 8%, despite an $8.7 million charge associated with an unsuccessful exploratory well drilled on the Borie Niobrara prospect in southeastern Wyoming. The overall decrease in 2010 was due to lower geological, geophysical and other exploratory expenses in 2010 compared to 2009. Abandonment and impairment expenses increased to $218.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with $46.1 million during the 2010 period. As discussed earlier, the increase was primarily due to the recognition of a non cash price related impairment charge of $195.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 on some of the Companys mature, dry gas, and higher cost properties in both the Northern and Southern Regions. The impairment charge related to the reduced value of these areas resulting from lower natural gas prices and the current forward curve for natural gas prices. The assets were written down to their estimated fair value. During the year ended December 31, 2010, abandonment and impairment expenses increased by $25.8 million from the 2009 period, due to higher impairment costs associated with the Companys unproven acreage, which QEP amortizes on a straight line basis over the primary term of the lease. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS BELOW OPERATING INCOME Interest and other income Interest and other income are comprised primarily of interest earned on investments, gains and losses on warehouse inventory, hedge ineffectiveness and other miscellaneous income. During the year ended December 31, 2011, interest and other income increased by $1.8 million, primarily due to the variance in inventory valuations, offset by lower gains on warehouse inventory sales. Interest and other income decreased $2.2 million in 2010 compared with 2009 due primarily to a valuation adjustment on pipe inventory. Loss from early extinguishment of debt The loss from early extinguishment of debt was $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $13.3 million in the 2010 period. The loss of $0.7 million in 2011 related to replacing the previous $1.0 billion revolving credit facility with a new $1.5 billion revolving credit facility in the third quarter of 2011. The loss of $13.3 million during 2010 was the result of the purchase of $638.0 million principal amount of senior notes and the termination of a $500 million term loan related to the Spin off from Questar both occurring in the third quarter of 2010. 47 Table of Contents Realized and unrealized gain (loss) on basis only swaps In the past, the Company has used basis only swaps to manage the risk of widening basis differentials. Basis only swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting. As of December 31, 2009, all of the Companys basis only swaps had been paired with fixed price swaps and re designated as cash flow hedges. Fair value changes occurring prior to re designation were recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments subsequent to the re designation were recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. Realized losses on settlements of basis only swaps relating to the period prior to re designation amounted to $117.7 million, $121.7 million and $25.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Unrealized gains on basis only swaps amounted to $117.7 million and $121.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Conversely, during the year ended December 31, 2009, QEP reported an unrealized loss on basis only swaps of $164.0 million. Interest expense Interest expense increased 7% to $90.0 million in 2011 compared to 2010 due to December 31, 2011 average debt levels that were approximately $165 million higher than average debt levels in the comparable prior period. During the year ended December 31, 2010, interest expense increased to $84.4 million from $70.1 million in 2009, primarily due to financing activities associated with the issuance of new bonds in 2010 and higher debt levels. Income taxes The effective combined federal and state income tax rate was 36.3% for the year ended December 31, 2011, slightly lower than the 36.9% in 2010, but higher than the 35.3% in 2009. The decrease in the combined rate during 2011 was primarily due to the Spin off which increased the 2010 rate. The 2010 increase in the combined rate was primarily due to a lower state income tax rate in 2009. DISCUSSION BY LINE OF BUSINESS QEP Energy QEP Energy reported net income of $104.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of 49% from $203.9 million in 2010. As discussed earlier, the primary reason for the decrease was the recognition of a non cash price related impairment charge of $195.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 on some of QEP Energys mature, dry gas, and higher cost properties in both the Northern and Southern Regions. The impairment charge related to the reduced value of these areas resulting from lower natural gas prices and the current forward curve for natural gas prices. QEP Energy net income also decreased as a result of the continual decline in net realized natural gas prices, which decreased 11% to $4.74 per Mcf in 2011, compared to $5.32 per Mcf in 2010. These natural gas price related negative impacts were partially offset by a 20% increase in natural gas equivalent total production and a 30% increase in net realized oil prices in 2011. Net realized oil prices were $86.63 per bbl in 2011 up from $66.48 in 2010. QEP Energys net income for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $203.9 million, $69.0 million higher than 2009. The 2010 increase over 2009 was due to higher production of 229.0 Bcfe and higher net realized crude oil and NGL prices in 2010, partially offset by lower net realized natural gas prices. Changes in unrealized basis only swaps increased net income $75.2 million and $76.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2011, and 2010, respectively, compared to decreasing net income by $103.3 million in 2009. Following is a summary of QEP Energys financial and operating results: 48 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (in millions) Operating Income Revenues Natural gas sales $ 1,239.1 $ 1,205.3 $ 1,187.2 $ 33.8 $ 18.1 Oil sales 324.2 198.1 141.3 126.1 56.8 NGL sales 129.7 47.9 22.5 81.8 25.4 Purchased gas sales 509.8 509.8 Other 10.4 5.0 5.0 5.4 Total Revenues 2,213.2 1,456.3 1,356.0 756.9 100.3 Operating expenses Purchased gas expense 506.4 506.4 Lease operating expense 148.2 127.3 127.5 20.9 (0.2 ) Natural gas, oil and NGL transportation and other handling costs 186.0 125.5 88.7 60.5 36.8 General and administrative 98.4 78.0 68.0 20.4 10.0 Production and property taxes 99.1 77.8 58.3 21.3 19.5 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 707.2 592.5 512.8 114.7 79.7 Exploration expenses 10.5 23.0 25.0 (12.5 ) (2.0 ) Abandonment and impairment 218.4 46.1 20.3 172.3 25.8 Total Operating Expenses 1,974.2 1,070.2 900.6 904.0 169.6 Net gain from asset sales 1.4 13.7 1.6 (12.3 ) 12.1 Operating Income 240.4 399.8 457.0 (159.4 ) (57.2 ) Interest and other income (loss) 4.0 2.1 3.9 1.9 (1.8 ) Income from unconsolidated affiliates 0.1 0.2 0.1 (0.1 ) 0.1 Unrealized and realized gain (loss) on basis only swaps (189.6 ) 189.6 Interest expense (81.9 ) (78.5 ) (63.9 ) (3.4 ) (14.6 ) Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes 162.6 323.6 207.5 (161.0 ) 116.1 Income taxes (57.9 ) (119.7 ) (72.6 ) 61.8 (47.1 ) Net Income Attributable to QEP $ 104.7 $ 203.9 $ 134.9 $ (99.2 ) $ 69.0 Operating expenses per unit The following table presents certain QEP Energy operating expenses on a per unit of production basis. QEP Energy total operating expenses (the sum of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, lease operating expense, natural gas, oil and NGL transportation and other handling costs, general and administrative expense, and a portion of total QEP interest expense that is allocated to QEP Energy based on intercompany agreements and production taxes) per Mcfe of production increased 2% to $4.81 per Mcfe in 2011 versus $4.72 per Mcfe in 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2010, QEP Energy total operating costs per Mcfe decreased $0.14 per Mcfe, or 3% from 2009. Operating expenses per unit are summarized in the following table: For the year ended December 31, Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (per Mcfe) Depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 2.57 $ 2.59 $ 2.71 $ (0.02 ) $ (0.12 ) Lease operating expense 0.54 0.56 0.67 (0.02 ) (0.11 ) Natural gas, oil and NGL transportation and other handling costs 0.68 0.55 0.47 0.13 0.08 General and administrative expense 0.36 0.34 0.36 0.02 (0.02 ) Allocated interest expense 0.30 0.34 0.34 (0.04 ) Production taxes 0.36 0.34 0.31 0.02 0.03 Total Operating Expenses $ 4.81 $ 4.72 $ 4.86 $ 0.09 $ (0.14 ) 49 Table of Contents Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense per Mcfe decreased $0.02 in the year ended December 31, 2011 from the 2010 period. QEP Energys DD&A expense increased $114.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 from the year ended December 31, 2010. While QEP Energys total DD&A increased in 2011, the lower per unit expense in 2011 was the result of booking NGL reserves associated with the fee based processing agreement entered into between QEP Energy and QEP Field Services for QEPs Pinedale production. In 2010, DD&A expense decreased by $0.12 per Mcfe compared to 2009 primarily as a result of increased proved reserves related to higher field level natural gas and oil prices compared to the prior year. Lease operating expense per Mcfe decreased $0.02 for the year ended December 31, 2011 from the 2010 period as the result of increased production volumes in lower cost areas. Growing production from new high rate, low operating cost wells in the Haynesville/Cotton Valley area and in the Pinedale Anticline, coupled with declining production from older higher cost areas, reduced average per Mcfe lease operating expense. Lease operating expense per Mcfe was 16% lower in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to higher production volumes combined with flat operating expenses. QEP Energys average production costs (lease operating expense) per Mcfe were 4% lower in the 2011 period compared to the 2010 period. The decrease was a result of growing production in lower cost operating areas such as Haynesville/Cotton Valley and Pinedale, coupled with declining production in higher cost areas, which more than offset the higher cost associated with operating the growing oil volumes in the Northern Region. QEP Energys average production cost decreased $0.11 per Mcfe in 2010 due to higher production volumes and flat operating expenses. The following table presents average production cost, excluding production taxes for QEP Energy for QEP Energy by region on a per unit of production basis. For the year ended December 31, Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (per Mcfe) Southern Region $ 0.50 $ 0.55 $ 0.79 $ (0.05 ) $ (0.24 ) Northern Region 0.58 0.56 0.57 0.02 (0.01 ) Average production cost 0.54 0.56 0.67 (0.02 ) (0.11 ) Natural gas, oil and NGL transportation and other handling costs per Mcfe were 24% higher in 2011 than in 2010, due primarily to processing costs associated with increased NGL production and related transportation costs under a revised processing agreement at Pinedale. Natural gas, oil and NGL transportation and other handling costs increased $0.08 per Mcfe in 2010 compared to 2009, due primarily to increased natural gas production and related transportation costs at the Haynesville/Cotton Valley area. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for a discussion of the recasting of transportation and other handling costs. General and administrative (G&A) expense per Mcfe increased $0.02 per Mcfe during the year ended December 31, 2011, as the result of higher G&A expenses, which were primarily related to employee benefit plan and stock based compensation related expenses, increased legal and outside professional services and higher insurance costs, which were partially offset by increased production in 2011. G&A expenses per Mcfe were 6% lower in 2010 than 2009 as a result of increased production volumes partially offset by higher labor, benefits and stock based compensation expenses in 2010. Allocated interest expense per unit of production decreased $0.04 per Mcfe in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to higher production volumes. Allocated interest expense per Mcfe of production was flat when comparing the year ended December 31, 2010 to 2009. In most states in which QEP Energy operates, QEP pays production taxes based on a percentage of field level revenue, except in Louisiana, where severance taxes are volume based. Accordingly, production taxes per Mcfe increased by $0.02 per Mcfe during the year ended December 31, 2011 because of higher field level oil and NGL prices. In the 2010 period, production taxes increased by 10% over the 2009 period, as the result of higher natural gas, oil and NGL prices. QEP Field Services QEP Field Services, which provides gas gathering and processing services, generated net income of $154.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $91.1 million in 2010, a 70% increase. During the year ended December 31, 2010, net income increased $21.7 million from the $69.4 million in 2009. The increase in net income in both 2011 and 2010 was the result of higher gathering and processing margins and increased throughput volumes. Following is a summary of QEP Field Services financial and operating results: 50 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (in millions) Operating Income Revenues NGL sales $ 180.0 $ 94.8 $ 71.9 $ 85.2 $ 22.9 Processing (fee based) 53.7 35.2 32.4 18.5 2.8 Other processing fees 2.2 0.2 2.2 (0.2 ) Gathering 161.1 152.5 127.3 8.6 25.2 Other gathering 68.5 36.7 32.8 31.8 3.9 Total Revenues 465.5 319.2 264.6 146.3 54.6 Operating expenses Processing 12.2 11.9 10.3 0.3 1.6 Processing plant fuel and shrinkage 49.2 32.6 28.1 16.6 4.5 Gathering 44.6 37.6 36.6 7.0 1.0 Natural gas, oil and NGL transportation and other handling costs 9.3 9.3 General and administrative 29.2 31.6 25.0 (2.4 ) 6.6 Taxes other than income taxes 6.1 4.4 4.6 1.7 (0.2 ) Depreciation, depletion and amortization 55.7 48.9 44.3 6.8 4.6 Total Operating Expenses 206.3 167.0 148.9 39.3 18.1 Net gain (loss) from asset sales (1.6 ) (0.1 ) 1.6 (1.5 ) Operating Income 259.2 150.6 115.6 108.6 35.0 Interest and other income 0.1 0.1 (0.2 ) 0.3 Income from unconsolidated affiliates 5.4 2.8 2.6 2.6 0.2 Interest expense (13.6 ) (7.6 ) (6.0 ) (6.0 ) (1.6 ) Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes 251.1 145.9 112.0 105.2 33.9 Income taxes (93.4 ) (51.9 ) (40.0 ) (41.5 ) (11.9 ) Income from Continuing Operations 157.7 94.0 72.0 63.7 22.0 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest (3.2 ) (2.9 ) (2.6 ) (0.3 ) (0.3 ) Net Income Attributable to QEP $ 154.5 $ 91.1 $ 69.4 $ 63.4 $ 21.7 See Gathering and Processing sections, as appeared earlier, for a discussion of the changes in QEP Field Services comparative financial statements. QEP Marketing QEP Marketing, which markets affiliate and third party natural gas and oil, and owns and operates a gas storage facility, generated net income from continuing operations of $8.4 million during 2011, compared with $6.7 million during 2010. The increase in 2011 was due to a $2.7 million increase in interest income and a 54% increase in marketing sales volumes, partially offset by a 5% decrease in marketing margins. QEP Marketing net income decreased 21% from the 2009 net income of $8.5 million. The 2010 decrease from 2009 was a result of lower marketing and storage margins due to an overall decrease in natural gas price volatility. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES QEP funds its operations, capital expenditures and working capital requirements with cash flow from its operating activities, borrowings under its credit facility and, periodically, proceeds from debt offerings and asset sales. The Company believes cash flow from operations and availability under its credit facility will be sufficient to fund the Companys planned capital expenditures and operating expenses for 2012. To the extent actual operating results differ from the Companys estimates, the Companys liquidity could be adversely affected. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Cash flows from operations are primarily affected by natural gas, oil and NGL production volumes and commodity prices (including the effects of settlements of the Companys derivative contracts) and by changes in working capital. QEP enters into commodity derivative transactions covering a substantial, but varying, portion of its anticipated future gas, oil and NGL production for the next 12 to 24 months. However, in general, QEP plans to hedge approximately 50% of its forecasted production by the end of the first quarter of the current year. See Commodity Derivative Impact above. 51 Table of Contents Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations increased 30% in 2011 compared to 2010, due to higher noncash adjustments to net income and a lower use of cash from operating assets and liabilities in 2011 compared with the use of cash in the 2010 period. Noncash adjustments to net income consisted primarily of depreciation, depletion and amortization; noncash unrealized gains and losses on basis only swaps; changes in deferred income taxes; and abandonment and impairment charges. Cash uses from operating assets and liabilities were higher in 2011 primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and inventories during 2011 compared to 2010. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities from continuing operations decreased in 2010 by $151.9 million from 2009. Cash sources from operating assets and liabilities were lower in 2010 primarily due to reductions in accounts receivable during 2009 and a decrease in current federal income taxes payable due to bonus depreciation. Net cash provided from continuing operating activities is presented below: Year Ended December 31, Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (in millions) Income from continuing operations $ 270.4 $ 285.9 $ 215.4 $ (15.5 ) $ 70.5 Noncash adjustments to net income 1,050.9 784.5 863.0 266.4 (78.5 ) Changes in operating assets and liabilities (28.7 ) (72.9 ) 71.0 44.2 (143.9 ) Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations $ 1,292.6 $ 997.5 $ 1,149.4 $ 295.1 $ (151.9 ) Cash Flows from Investing Activities A comparison of capital expenditures for continuing operations during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 and a forecast for calendar year 2012 are presented in the table below: Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 2012 Forecast (in millions) QEP Energy $ 1,338.8 $ 1,215.8 $ 1,033.7 $ 1,280.0 QEP Field Services 101.6 268.2 71.8 170.0 QEP Marketing and other 5.4 1.9 1.4 Total accrued capital expenditures of continuing operations 1,445.8 1,485.9 1,106.9 1,450.0 Change in accruals (14.7 ) (16.9 ) 90.0 Total cash capital expenditures of continuing operations $ 1,431.1 $ 1,469.0 $ 1,196.9 $ 1,450.0 QEP Energy capital investment during the year ended December 31, 2011 increased $126.1 million over the 2010 period due to an increase in the number of company operated well completions as a result of ongoing efficiency gains, combined with acquisition of additional working interests in certain wells due to partner elections not to participate. QEP Energy capital expenditures were higher in 2010 compared to 2009 due to an increased drilling program in 2010. QEP Field Services capital investment declined $166.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the 2010 period due to the completion of major capital projects in eastern Utah and northwest Louisiana in late 2010 and the completion of the Blacks Fork II plant early in the third quarter of 2011. QEP Field Services capital investment was higher in 2010 than 2009 due to increased investment in its gathering, processing and treating facilities to expand capacity in western Wyoming, eastern Utah and northwest Louisiana. Cash Flows from Financing Activities During the year ended December 31, 2011, net cash used in investing activities of $1,422.9 million exceeded net cash provided by operating activities of $1,292.6 million by $130.3 million. Net cash used in investing activities during 2010 also exceeded net cash provided by operating activities by $393.0 million, however, in 2009, net cash provided by operating activities of $1,149.4 million exceeded net cash used in investing activities of $1,146.4 million by $3.0 million. The reason that 2009 operating cash flows exceeded investing activities was a result of the economic downturn, in which the Company limited capital expenditures to approximate internally generated cash flow. For 2011, long term debt increased by a net change of $207.1 million while short term debt decreased by $58.5 million. At December 31, 2011, long term debt consisted of $606.5 million outstanding under QEPs revolving credit facility and $1,072.9 million in senior notes (including $5.5 million of net original issue discount). At December 31, 2011, combined short term and long term debt was 33% and equity was 67% of total capital. All intercompany loans between Questar and QEP, which have been historically reported as notes payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were repaid on June 30, 2010, in conjunction with the Spin off. 52 Table of Contents Credit Facility During the third quarter of 2011, QEP entered into a new revolving credit facility, which matures in August 2016 and replaced the previous $1.0 billion credit facility. The terms of the new credit facility provide for loan commitments of $1.5 billion from a syndicate of financial institutions. The new credit facility provides for borrowings at short term interest rates and contains customary covenants and restrictions. The agreement also contains the provisions which would allow for the amount of the facility to be increased to $2.0 billion and for the maturity to be extended for two additional one year periods. QEP increased its borrowings under its credit facility from $400.0 million as of December 31, 2010, to $606.5 million as of December 31, 2011. QEPs weighted average interest rate on borrowings from its credit facilities was 3.05%. Proceeds from borrowings under the credit facility were used to refinance outstanding amounts under the Companys previous credit facility and will be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures. The credit agreement includes financial covenants (i) limiting the ratio of the consolidated funded debt of the Company to the sum of consolidated funded debt plus shareholders equity to not more than 0.6 to 1, (ii) limiting the ratio of the consolidated funded debt of the Company to the Companys consolidated EBITDA to not more than 3.5 to 1, and (iii) if the Companys debt ratings fall below a certain level, limiting the Company total consolidated funded debt to a specified aggregate amount. At December 31, 2011, QEP was in compliance with all of its debt covenants. At February 17, 2012, QEP had $614.0 million outstanding under its revolving credit facility and $4.1 million of letters of credit issued. Senior Notes The Companys senior notes outstanding as of December 31, 2011 totaled $1,078.4 million principal amount and are comprised of four issues as follows: $176.8 million 6.05% Senior Notes due September 2016 $138.6 million 6.80% Senior Notes due April 2018 $138.0 million 6.80% Senior Notes due March 2020 $625.0 million 6.875% Senior Notes due March 2021 In August 2010, the Company purchased $638.0 million principal amount of its senior notes and paid required premium and accrued interest pursuant to the requirement in the notes indenture relating to a change of control. The Company used cash on hand and proceeds from its $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and its $500.0 million term loan to purchase all of the tendered notes. Subsequent to the purchase of the tendered notes, the Company issued $625.0 million principal amount of senior notes due 2021. The notes were issued at a discount, resulting in gross proceeds of $619.2 million which were used to pay fees and expenses associated with the issuance and to refinance a portion of the indebtedness incurred under the term loan and revolving credit facilities to purchase the tendered senior notes. Upon repayment of the term loan, commitments under the term loan were terminated. Capital Expenditures During the year ended December 31, 2011, cash capital expenditures decreased 3% to $1,431.1 million, which included $48.0 million for property acquisitions, compared to $1,469.0 million during the same period in 2010. The decrease was driven by reduced development drilling in the Haynesville/Cotton Valley and Pinedale Anticline, partially offset by higher capital investment in development drilling in the Midcontinent and the Rockies Legacy divisions. Approximately $1,295.5 million was used in QEP Energy, including $1,247.5 million in drilling and completion and other expenditures and $48.0 million in property acquisition costs. QEP Field Services 2011 capital expenditures of $130.1 million were used to expand capacity at the Companys gathering, processing and treating facilities including the Blacks Fork II cryogenic gas processing plant which was completed in July of 2011. In 2010, capital expenditures were $272.1 million higher than in the comparable 2009 period. The increase in 2010 was driven by QEP Field Services and its increased investment in its gathering, processing and treating facilities to expand capacity in western Wyoming, eastern Utah and northwest Louisiana. Also contributing to the 2010 increase was QEP Energys increased capital expenditures due to an increased drilling program in 2010. In 2012, QEP intends to fund capital expenditures with cash flow from operating activities and borrowings under its revolving credit facility, if needed. As a result of the continued spread between oil and natural gas prices, in 2012 QEP plans to decrease capital expenditures for the Haynesville Shale and other dry gas development areas and increase capital expenditures for higher return projects, including Pinedale, the Bakken, and oil directed horizontal drilling in the Powder River Basin and Midcontinent and continued development of QEPs Uinta Basin Red Wash liquids rich gas play. QEP has allocated approximately 88% of its forecasted 2012 drilling and completion capital expenditure budget to oil and liquids rich natural gas projects in its portfolio. The Company has budgeted approximately $1,450.0 million for capital expenditures in 2012, of which it has allocated $1,280.0 million to QEP Energy. QEP plans to invest approximately $170.0 million in capital expenditures to grow its midstream business, including construction of a new 150 MMcfpd fee based cryogenic gas processing plant in the Uinta Basin. The aggregate levels of capital expenditures for 2012 and the allocation of those expenditures are dependent on a variety of factors, including drilling results, natural gas and oil prices, industry conditions, the extent to which properties or working interests are acquired, the availability of capital resources to fund the expenditures and changes in managements business assessments as to where QEPs capital can be most profitably deployed. Accordingly, the actual levels of capital expenditures and the allocation of those expenditures may vary materially from QEPs estimates. 53 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements QEP may enter into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off balance sheet obligations. At December 31, 2011, the Companys material off balance sheet arrangements and transactions included operating lease arrangements, drilling and transportation contracts and undrawn letters of credit. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect QEPs liquidity or availability of, or requirements for capital resources. See Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commitments below for more information regarding off balance sheet arrangements. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commitments In the course of ordinary business activities, QEP enters into a variety of contractual cash obligations and other commitments. The following table summarizes the significant contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2011: Payments Due by Year Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 After 2016 (in millions) Long term debt (1) $ 1,684.9 $ $ $ $ $ 783.3 $ 901.6 Interest on fixed rate long term debt (2) 579.4 72.5 72.5 72.5 72.5 68.9 220.5 Drilling contracts 146.2 70.8 37.2 36.1 2.1 Transportation contracts 406.8 45.4 44.3 43.3 43.2 41.8 188.8 Asset Retirement Obligations (3) 284.6 15.3 2.9 3.2 2.4 4.0 256.8 Operating leases 59.1 5.6 6.1 5.6 5.7 5.8 30.3 Total $ 3,161.0 $ 209.6 $ 163.0 $ 160.7 $ 125.9 $ 903.8 $ 1,598.0 (1) Includes $606.5 milllion relating to the Companys revolving credit facility.

See Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10 K, note 11 "Employee Benefits" for additional information. Critical Accounting Policies, and Estimates QEPs significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of its Annual Report. The Companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported results of operations and financial position. The following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment on the part of management. Gas and Oil Reserves Gas and oil reserve estimates require significant judgments in the evaluation of all available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given field may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, production history, economic assumptions relating to commodity prices, operating expenses, severance and other taxes, capital expenditures and remediation costs. The subjective judgments and variances in data for various fields make these estimates less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures. Estimates of proved gas and oil reserves significantly affect the Companys DD&A expense. For example, if estimates of proved reserves decline, the DD&A rate will increase, resulting in a decrease in net income. A decline in estimates of proved reserves could also cause QEP to perform an impairment analysis to determine if the carrying amount of crude oil and natural gas properties exceeds fair value and could result in an impairment charge, which would reduce earnings. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited). Successful Efforts Accounting for Gas and Oil Operations The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for gas and oil property acquisitions, exploration, development and production activities. Under this method, the acquisition costs of proved and unproved properties, successful exploratory wells and development wells are capitalized. Other exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs, the delay rental and administrative costs associated with unproved property and unsuccessful exploratory well costs are expensed. Costs to operate and maintain wells and field equipment are expensed as incurred. 54 Table of Contents The capitalized costs of unproved properties are generally combined and amortized over the expected holding period for such properties. Individually significant unproved properties are periodically reviewed for impairment. Capitalized costs of unproved properties are reclassified as proved property when related proved reserves are determined or charged against the impairment allowance when abandoned. Capitalized proved property acquisition costs are amortized by field using the unit of production method based on proved reserves. Capitalized exploratory well and development costs are amortized similarly by field based on proved developed reserves. The calculation takes into consideration estimated future equipment dismantlement, surface restoration and property abandonment costs, net of estimated equipment salvage values. Other property and equipment are generally depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives or the unit of production method for certain processing plants. A gain or loss is generally recognized only when an entire field is sold or abandoned, or if the unit of production amortization rate would be significantly affected. QEP Energy engages an independent reservoir engineering consultant to prepare estimates of the proved gas and oil reserves. Reserve estimates are based on a complex and highly interpretive process that is subject to continuous revision as additional production and development drilling information becomes available. Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties Proved gas and oil properties are evaluated on a field by field basis for potential impairment. Other properties are evaluated on a specific asset basis or in groups of similar assets, as applicable. Impairment is indicated when a triggering event occurs and the sum of the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of an evaluated asset is less than the assets carrying value. Triggering events could include, but are not limited to, an impairment of gas and oil reserves caused by mechanical problems, faster than expected decline of reserves, lease ownership issues, other than temporary decline in gas and oil prices and changes in the utilization of midstream gathering and processing assets. If impairment is indicated, fair value is calculated using a discounted cash flow approach. Cash flow estimates require forecasts and assumptions for many years into the future for a variety of factors, including commodity prices and operating costs. During the fourth quarter of 2011, QEP recorded an impairment charge of $195.2 million on some of its mature, dry gas, and higher cost properties in both the Northern Region and Southern Region. The impairment charge related to the reduced value of these areas resulting from lower natural gas prices and the current forward curve for natural gas prices. Asset Retirement Obligations QEP is obligated to fund the costs of disposing of long lived assets upon their abandonment. The majority of QEPs asset retirement obligations (AROs) relate to the plugging of wells and the related abandonment of oil and gas properties. QEPs AROs are recorded at estimated fair value, measured by reference to the expected future cash outflows required to satisfy the retirement obligation discounted at QEPs credit adjusted risk free interest rate. Revisions to estimated AROs can result from changes in retirement cost estimates, revisions to estimated inflation rates and changes in the estimate timing of abandonment. Accounting for Derivative Contracts The Company uses derivative contracts, typically fixed price swaps and costless collars, to protect against a decline in the price it receives from its natural gas, oil and NGL production. Accounting rules for derivatives require marking these instruments to fair value at the balance sheet reporting date. The change in fair value is reported either in net income or AOCI depending on the structure of the derivative. The Company has historically structured the majority of its energy derivative instruments as cash flow hedges as defined in ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded on the balance sheet and in AOCI until the underlying gas or oil is produced. When a derivative is terminated before its contract expires, the associated gain or loss is recognized in income over the life of the previously hedged production. Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accountings are included as part of operating income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. As of December 31, 2011, QEP designated most of its natural gas, oil and NGL derivative contracts as cash flow hedges, whose unrealized fair value gains and losses were recorded to AOCI. Effective January 1, 2012, the Company has elected to de designate all of its natural gas, oil and NGL derivative contracts that had previously been designated as cash flow hedges at December 31, 2011 and have elected to discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of commodity derivative contracts will be reported each quarter in earnings as unrealized gains (losses). See Part II, Item 8, footnote 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of this Form 10 K for additional information. 55 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized in the period that services are provided or products are delivered. QEP Energy uses the sales method of accounting whereby revenue is recognized for all gas, oil and NGL sold to purchasers. Revenues include estimates for the two most recent months using published commodity price indexes and volumes supplied by field operators. A liability is recorded to the extent that QEP Energy has an imbalance in excess of its share of remaining reserves in an underlying property. QEP Marketing presents revenues on a gross revenue basis. QEP Marketing does not engage in speculative hedging transactions, nor does it buy and sell energy contracts with the objective of generating profits on short term differences in prices. Environmental Obligations and Other Contingencies Management makes judgments and estimates in accordance with applicable accounting rules when it establishes reserves for environmental remediation, litigation and other contingent matters. Provisions for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. Estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of matters, including, but not limited to, the stage of investigation, the stage of the remedial design, evaluation of existing remediation technologies, and presently enacted laws and regulations. In future periods, a number of factors could significantly change QEPs estimate of environmental remediation costs, such as changes in laws and regulations, changes in the interpretation or administration of laws and regulations, revisions to the remedial design, unanticipated construction problems, identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater, and changes in costs of labor, equipment and technology. Consequently, it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly. Benefit Plan Obligations QEP has non contributory defined benefit pension plans, including both qualified and supplemental plans. QEP also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees. Determination of the benefit obligations for QEPs defined benefit pension and postretirement plans impacts the recorded amounts for such obligations on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the amount of benefit expense recorded to the Consolidated Income Statement. Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves many assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate used to measure the present value of plan benefit obligations, the expected long term rates of return on plan assets, the rate of future increases in compensation levels of participating employees and the future level of health care costs. Share Based Compensation QEP uses the Black Scholes Merton mathematical model to estimate the fair value of stock options for accounting purposes. The use of this model requires significant judgment with respect to the risk free interest rate, expected price volatility, expected dividend yield, and expected life. Income Taxes The amount of income taxes recorded by QEP requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of various tax jurisdictions throughout the United States. QEP has recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences, operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. QEP routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and reduces such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. QEP routinely assesses potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, establishes accruals for such amounts. The accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities, including deferred state income tax assets and liabilities, are subject to significant judgment by management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances. Although management considers its tax accruals adequate, material changes in these accruals may occur in the future, based on the impact of tax audits, changes in legislation and resolution of pending or future tax matters. Recent Accounting Developments See Recent Accounting Developments in Note 1 of the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements, in Item 8, Part II of this annual report. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK QEPs primary market risk exposure arises from changes in the market price for natural gas, oil and NGL, and to a lesser extent, volatility in interest rates. These risks can affect revenues and cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. QEP Energy and QEP Marketing have long term contracts for pipeline capacity and are obligated to pay for transportation services with no guarantee that QEP will be able to fully utilize the contractual capacity of these transportation commitments. If energy prices decline or increase significantly, revenues and cash flow may significantly decline or increase. In addition, a non cash write down of the Companys oil and gas properties may be required if future oil and natural gas commodity prices experience a sustained, significant decline. A sensitivity analysis of the Companys commodity price related derivative instruments to changes in the price of the underlying commodities is presented below. 56 Table of Contents Commodity Price Risk Management QEPs subsidiaries use commodity price derivative instruments in the normal course of business to reduce the risk of adverse commodity price movements. However, these same arrangements typically limit future gains from favorable price movements. The Companys risk management policies provide for the use of derivative instruments to manage this risk. The types of commodity derivative instruments utilized by the Company include fixed price swaps, costless collars, and basis only swaps. The volume of commodity derivative instruments utilized by the Company may vary from year to year. Both exchange and over the counter traded commodity derivative instruments may be subject to margin deposit requirements, and the Company may be required from time to time to deposit cash or provide letters of credit with exchange brokers or its counterparties in order to satisfy these margin requirements. The derivative instruments currently utilized by the Company do not have margin requirements or collateral provisions that would require payments prior to the scheduled cash settlement dates. As of December 31, 2011, QEP held sale and purchase commodity price derivative contracts totaling 213.0 million MMBtu of natural gas, 2.0 million barrels of oil, and 53.9 million gallons of NGL. As of December 31, 2010, the QEP derivative contracts covered 247.5 million MMBtu of natural gas and 1.1 million barrels of oil. Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011, are presented below: Cash Flow Hedges Basis Only Swaps Total (in millions) Net fair value of gas and oil derivative contracts outstanding at Dec. 31, 2010 $ 356.2 $ (117.7 ) $ 238.5 Contracts settled (311.1 ) 117.7 (193.4 ) Change in gas and oil prices on futures markets 214.7 214.7 Contracts added 136.1 136.1 Net fair value of gas, oil and NGL derivative contracts outstanding at December 31, 2011 $ 395.9 $ $ 395.9 A table of the net fair value of gas, oil, and NGL derivative contracts that are scheduled to settle over the next five years as of December 31, 2011, is shown below. Derivatives representing approximately 69% of the net fair value will settle in the next twelve months and will be reclassified from AOCI to the Consolidated Statements of Income: Cash Flow Hedges Basis Only Swaps Total (in millions) Contracts maturing by December 31, 2012 $ 272.4 $ $ 272.4 Contracts maturing between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013 123.5 123.5 Contracts maturing between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2014 Contracts maturing between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2015 Net fair value of gas, oil and NGL derivative contracts outstanding at December 31, 2011 $ 395.9 $ $ 395.9 The following table shows the sensitivity of fair value of gas and oil derivative contracts and basis only swaps to changes in the market price of gas and oil and basis differentials: December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 (in millions) Net fair value asset (liability) $ 395.9 $ 238.5 Fair value if market prices of gas, oil and NGL and basis differentials decline by 10% 490.3 356.2 Fair value if market prices of gas, oil and NGL and basis differentials increase by 10% 301.4 132.1 Utilizing the actual derivative contractual volumes, a 10% increase in underlying commodity prices would reduce the fair value of these instruments by $94.5 million, while a 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices would increase the fair value of these instruments by $94.4 million. However, a gain or loss would eventually be substantially offset by the actual sales value of the physical production covered by the derivative instruments. For additional information regarding the Companys commodity derivative transactions, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Commodity Derivatives Impact under Part I, Item 2 and see Note 6 Derivative Contracts under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Credit Risk QEP requests credit support and, in some cases, financial guarantees, letters of credit or prepayment from companies that pose unfavorable credit risks. The Companys five largest customers accounted for 32%, and 27% in aggregate, of QEP revenues before elimination of intercompany transactions in 2011 and 2010, and their accounts were current at December 31, 2011. However, each of the five largest customers sales were below 10% of QEP revenues. 57 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Management The Companys ability to borrow and the rates quoted by lenders can be adversely affected by the illiquid credit markets as described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The Companys credit facility has floating interest rates and as such, exposes QEP to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase 10% over their average 2011, 2010 and 2009 levels and at QEPs average level of borrowing for those years, QEPs annualized interest expense would increase by $1.3 million, $0.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively, or less than 2% of the Companys total interest expense in each year. 58 Table of Contents
