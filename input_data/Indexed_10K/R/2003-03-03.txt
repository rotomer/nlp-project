ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Managements Discussion and Analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Ryder System, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The Companys operating segments are aggregated into reportable business segments based primarily upon similar economic characteristics, products, services and delivery methods. The Company operates in three reportable business segments: (1) Fleet Management Solutions (FMS), which provides full service leasing, commercial rental and programmed maintenance of trucks, tractors and trailers to customers, principally in the U.S., Canada and the U.K.; (2) Supply Chain Solutions (SCS), which provides comprehensive supply chain consulting and lead logistics management solutions that support customers entire supply chains, from inbound raw materials through distribution of finished goods throughout North America, in Latin America, Europe and Asia; and (3) Dedicated Contract Carriage (DCC), which provides vehicles and drivers as part of a dedicated transportation solution, principally in North America. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (In thousands) Earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (1)(2) $ 112,565 18,678 89,032 Per diluted common share 1.80 0.31 1.49 Net earnings (1)(2)(3) 93,666 18,678 89,032 Per diluted common share 1.50 0.31 1.49 Weighted average shares outstanding diluted 62,587 60,665 59,759 (1) Results include restructuring and other charges of $2 million after tax, or $0.04 per diluted common share in 2002, $81 million after tax, or $1.34 per diluted common share in 2001 and $26 million after tax, or $0.44 per diluted common share in 2000. See Restructuring and Other Charges, Net in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. (2) Results for 2001 include a one time reduction in deferred taxes of $7 million, or $0.11 per diluted common share, as a result of a change in Canadian tax law that affected the Companys Canadian operations. Results include goodwill and intangible amortization of $12 million after tax, or $0.19 per diluted common share in 2001 and $10 million after tax, or $0.17 per diluted common share in 2000. (3) Net earnings for 2002 include the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for goodwill resulting in an after tax charge of $19 million, or $0.30 per diluted common share. Earnings before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle increased 503 percent to $113 million in 2002 compared with 2001. The increase in earnings was due primarily to a significant reduction in restructuring and other charges from $81 million after tax in 2001 compared with $2 million after tax in 2002. The increase in earnings was also attributable to the Companys continued cost containment actions and operational process improvement efforts, improved rental utilization, increased volumes within the automotive sector of SCS, lower interest costs and the discontinuance of amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (See Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). These earnings increases were partially offset by a one time reduction in deferred taxes of $7 million in 2001 as a result of a change in Canadian tax law and higher pension costs of $19 million after tax in 2002, compared with the same period last year. The earnings growth rate in 2002 exceeded the earnings per share growth rate because the average number of shares outstanding increased reflecting the impact of stock option exercises during the year. 13 Earnings decreased 79 percent to $19 million in 2001 compared with 2000. The decrease in earnings in 2001 was due primarily to increased restructuring and other charges as part of the Companys implementation of strategic initiatives during 2001 to reduce Company expenses and improve profitability. See Restructuring and Other Charges, Net for a further discussion of such initiatives. The 2001 decrease also resulted from a 6 percent decrease in revenue as discussed below. See Operating Results by Business Segment for a further discussion of operating results in the past three years. Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (In thousands) Revenue: Fleet Management Solutions $ 3,183,022 3,352,540 3,555,990 Supply Chain Solutions 1,388,299 1,453,881 1,595,252 Dedicated Contract Carriage 517,961 534,962 551,706 Eliminations (313,017 ) (335,260 ) (366,156 ) Total $ 4,776,265 5,006,123 5,336,792 Revenue decreased 5 percent to $4.8 billion in 2002 compared with 2001. All business segments experienced a revenue decrease in 2002 over 2001 as a result of the continued slow economic conditions in the U.S. and in other countries where the Company operates. The FMS revenue decrease of 5 percent also reflects the effects of a smaller overall fleet (primarily rental) and lower fuel services revenue as a result of lower average fuel prices and volumes. For all years reported, the Company realized minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in fuel services revenue. SCS revenue decreased 5 percent as a result of volume reductions, especially in the electronics, high tech and telecommunications sector and the non renewal of certain customer contracts. Revenue in 2001 decreased 6 percent compared with 2000, led by SCS, which decreased 9 percent. The decrease was due to volume reductions in the U.S. and in Latin America and the sale of the contracts and related net assets associated with the disposal of the outbound auto carriage business of the Companys Brazilian SCS operation (see further details in Restructuring and Other Charges, Net). FMS revenue declined 6 percent due primarily to decreases in fuel services revenue resulting from lower average prices and volumes. Revenue during 2001 was also impacted by exchange rates on translation of foreign subsidiary revenues, particularly those in the U.K. and Brazil. The FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment, sells fuel and provides maintenance and other ancillary services to the SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at approximate fair value as if the sales were made to third parties. Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (In thousands) Operating expense $ 1,949,384 2,132,500 2,324,433 Percentage of revenue 41 % 43 % 44 % Operating expense decreased 9 percent to $1.9 billion in 2002 compared with 2001. The decrease was a result of a reduction in FMS fuel costs as a result of lower average prices and volumes in 2002, a reduction in overheads due to the Companys continuing cost containment actions, including the shut down of certain facilities in 2001, and the cancellation of an information technology outsourcing contract. Operating expense decreased 8 percent in 2001 compared with 2000. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower fuel costs due to lower average prices and volumes, reduced overhead and licensing costs. 14 Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (In thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $ 1,268,704 1,212,184 1,226,558 Percentage of revenue 27 % 24 % 23 % Salaries and employee related costs increased 5 percent to $1.3 billion in 2002 compared with 2001. The increase was due to growth in pension and medical benefit costs, higher salary expense from the in sourcing of certain information technology functions and greater incentive compensation, which was partially offset by decreased salaries and other employee related costs as a result of 2001 strategic initiatives that resulted in the termination of over 1,400 employees. See Restructuring and Other Charges, Net for further discussion. The number of employees at December 31, 2002 decreased 6 percent to approximately 27,800, compared with 29,500 at December 31, 2001. Pension costs for 2002 totaled $29 million compared with pension income of $1 million in 2001, and principally impacted FMS. The increase in pension costs is attributable primarily to the U.S. pension plan and reflects the adverse effect of negative pension asset returns in 2001 as well as a declining interest rate environment resulting in a lower discount rate used to measure benefit obligations. Based on actual returns experienced in 2002 and continued lower interest rate levels, the Company expects total pension expense for 2003 to increase by approximately $56 million on a pre tax basis. Such 2003 estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of actuarial analysis of all pension plans. See Accounting Matters for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. The anticipated pension expense in 2003 would primarily impact FMS, which employs the majority of the Companys employees that participate in the Companys primary U.S. pension plan. Salaries and employee related costs decreased 1 percent in 2001 as compared with 2000. The decrease was a result of reductions in headcount and was largely off set by a reduction in net pension income in 2001 compared with 2000. Net pension income was $1 million and $42 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (In thousands) Freight under management expense $ 414,369 436,413 506,709 Percentage of revenue 9 % 9 % 10 % Freight under management (FUM) expense represents subcontracted freight costs on logistics contracts for which the Company purchases transportation. FUM expense decreased 5 percent to $414 million in 2002 compared with 2001. The decrease was due to revenue reductions in related operating units of the SCS business segment as a result of reduced freight volumes in the U.S. and South America and the non renewal of unprofitable business. FUM expense decreased 14 percent to $436 million in 2001 compared with 2000. The decrease was due to reduced freight volumes and decreases in South America as a result of the sale of the outbound auto carriage business of Ryder Brazil. Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (In thousands) Depreciation expense $ 552,491 545,485 580,356 Gains on vehicle sales, net (14,223 ) (11,968 ) (19,307 ) Equipment rental 343,531 427,024 373,157 Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 1 percent to $552 million in 2002 compared with 2001. Depreciation expense increased due to a greater number of owned (compared with leased) revenue earning equipment units as well as reduced estimated residual values associated with certain owned tractors. Depreciation expense decreased 6 percent 15 to $545 million in 2001 compared with 2000. The decrease in depreciation expense during 2001 resulted principally from sale leaseback and other leasing transactions which increased the number of leased (compared with owned) vehicles in the Companys fleet. See discussion on Fleet Management Solutions in Operating Results by Business Segment for further detail on vehicle counts. Gains on vehicle sales increased 19 percent to $14 million in 2002 compared with 2001. Despite a reduction in the number of vehicles sold, the Company experienced an increase in gains on vehicle sales due to a decline in the average book value of units sold. The decline in the average book value of units sold reflects the aforementioned increase in depreciation expense and an increase in the age of vehicles sold. Average proceeds per unit decreased by approximately 9 percent in 2002 reflecting the extension of vehicle lives and the continued weak used truck market which began to impact the Company during the second quarter of 2000. Gains on vehicle sales decreased 38 percent to $12 million in 2001 compared with 2000. The decrease in gains on vehicle sales in 2001 was due to weak demand in the used truck market reflected in lower average sales proceeds per unit. The Company periodically reviews and adjusts residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See Accounting Matters for further discussion on depreciation and residual value guarantees. The Company believes that its carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate. However, a greater than anticipated decline in the market for used vehicles may require the Company to further adjust such values and estimates. Equipment rental primarily consists of rental costs on revenue earning equipment in FMS. Equipment rental costs decreased 20 percent to $344 million in 2002 compared with 2001. The decrease in 2002 equipment rental is due to a decrease in the number of leased vehicles and lower lease rates due to a changing mix of leased units. Current year results also include decreased lease termination charges as a result of improved market pricing. Equipment rental costs increased 14 percent to $427 million in 2001 compared with 2000. The increase was due to sale leaseback transactions, including securitization transactions, entered into during 2001 which increased the number of leased vehicles as well as increases in reserves for guaranteed lease termination values to reflect decreases in the estimated residual values of leased equipment. The total number of revenue earning equipment units (owned and leased) at December 31, 2002 decreased approximately 5 percent from December 31, 2001 levels reflecting the Companys continued focus on asset management and reducing capital expenditures while maximizing utilization of the FMS commercial rental fleet. Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (In thousands) Interest expense $ 91,718 118,549 154,009 Percentage of revenue 2 % 2 % 3 % Interest expense decreased 23 percent to $92 million in 2002 compared with 2001. The decrease in interest expense reflects lower debt levels due to reduced capital spending, generally lower market interest rates and reduced effective interest rates as a result of hedging transactions entered into during the first quarter of 2002. Interest expense decreased 23 percent to $119 million in 2001 compared with 2000. The decrease in interest expense during 2001 was primarily due to debt reductions associated with the use of proceeds from the aforementioned sale leaseback transactions and generally lower interest rates compared with 2000. The reductions in interest expense principally benefited FMS. Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (In thousands) Miscellaneous (income) expense, net $ (9,808 ) (1,334 ) 7,542 16 The Company had net miscellaneous income of $10 million in 2002 compared with net miscellaneous income of $1 million in 2001. Net miscellaneous income in 2002 is principally composed of servicing fee income for administrative services provided to vehicle lease trusts related to the Companys vehicle securitization transactions. The increase in net miscellaneous income during 2002 is primarily attributed to a reduction in losses on the sale of receivables related to the decreased use of the Companys revolving facility for the sale of receivables and 2001 losses on the sale of operating property and equipment. The Company had net miscellaneous income of $1 million in 2001 compared with net miscellaneous expense of $8 million in 2000. The change was primarily due to a reduction in losses on the sale of receivables related to the decreased use of the Companys revolving facility for the sale of trade receivables combined with increased servicing fee income related to the Companys vehicle securitization transactions. See Financial Resources and Liquidity Off balance Sheet Arrangements for further discussion on securitization transactions. Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 4,216 116,564 42,014 In 2002 restructuring and other charges, net decreased to $4 million from $117 million in 2001 and $42 million in 2000. See Restructuring and Other Charges, Net for further discussion. Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (In thousands) Provision for income taxes $ 63,318 12,028 52,289 The Companys effective tax rate was 36.0 percent in 2002 compared with 39.2 percent in 2001 and 37.0 percent in 2000. The higher 2001 effective tax rate resulted primarily from increased net non deductible items in 2001, principally the write down of goodwill, included in restructuring and other charges, partially offset by a permanent reduction in corporate tax rates in Canada. This resulted in a one time reduction in the Companys related deferred taxes of approximately $7 million. 17 RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES, NET The components of restructuring and other charges, net of (recoveries) in 2002, 2001 and 2000 were as follows: Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (In thousands) Restructuring charges (recoveries), net: Severance and employee related costs $ 5,198 30,438 (1,077 ) Facilities and related costs 106 6,261 (2,009 ) 5,304 36,699 (3,086 ) Other (recoveries) charges: Asset write downs (285 ) 40,046 44,487 Goodwill impairment 24,425 Strategic consulting fees (64 ) 8,586 958 Loss on sale of business 3,512 Contract termination costs (219 ) 8,345 Insurance reserves sold business (520 ) (2,920 ) 700 Gain on sale of corporate aircraft (2,129 ) Other (1,045 ) Total $ 4,216 116,564 42,014 Allocation of restructuring and other charges across business segments in 2002, 2001 and 2000 is as follows: Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (In thousands) Fleet Management Solutions $ (1,042 ) 38,268 38,992 Supply Chain Solutions 4,082 56,221 2,422 Dedicated Contract Carriage 14 964 Central Support Services 1,162 21,111 600 Total $ 4,216 116,564 42,014 2002 Charges During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company eliminated approximately 140 positions as a result of cost management actions principally in the Companys SCS business segment and Central Support Services, which were substantially finalized as of December 31, 2002. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $7 million. The Company estimates pre tax cost savings of approximately $14 million as a result of the 2002 cost management activities. These savings are expected to be realized in salaries and employee related costs. During 2002, severance and employee related costs totaling $2 million that had been recorded in prior restructuring charges were reversed due to refinements in the estimates. Other recoveries during 2002 include net gains (recoveries) on sale of owned facilities identified for closure in prior restructuring charges, and the reversal of contract termination costs recognized in 2001 resulting from refinements in estimates and the final settlement of insurance reserves attributed to a previously sold business. 18 2001 Charges In late 2000, the Company communicated to its employees its planned strategic initiatives to reduce Company expenses. As part of such initiatives, the Company reviewed employee functions and staffing levels to eliminate redundant work or otherwise restructure work in a manner that led to a workforce reduction. The process resulted in terminations of over 1,400 employees during 2001, which were substantially finalized as of December 31, 2002. Severance and employee related costs of $30 million (net of $2 million in recoveries of prior year charges) in 2001 included termination benefits to employees whose jobs were eliminated as part of this review. During the third quarter of 2001, the Company initiated the shutdown of Systemcare, Ryders shared user home delivery network in the U.K. The shutdown was initiated as a result of managements review of future prospects for the operation in light of historical and anticipated operating losses. The shutdown was completed after meeting contractual obligations to current customers, which extended to December 31, 2002. The severance and employee related charge included $3 million incurred as part of the Systemcare shutdown. During 2001, the Company identified more than 55 facilities in the U.S. and in other countries to be closed in order to improve profitability. Facilities and related costs of $6 million in 2001 represent contractual lease obligations for closed facilities. Additionally, during 2001 the Company recorded various other charges which are summarized as follows: Asset write downs: Asset write downs of $40 million were recorded during 2001 and are described below: In 2001, the Company cancelled an information technology project in its FMS business segment. In connection with the cancellation, the Company recorded a non cash charge of $22 million for the write down of software licenses acquired for the project that could not be resold or redeployed and software development costs and assets related to the project that had no future economic benefit. In 1997, the Company entered into an Information Technology Services Agreement (ITSA) with Accenture LLP (Accenture) under which the Company outsourced many of its information technology needs that were previously provided by Ryder employees. Under the terms of the ITSA, the Company prepaid for a number of services to be provided over the 10 year term of the agreement expiring in 2007. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company was also obligated to pay certain termination costs to Accenture in the event the ITSA was terminated by the Company prior to the expiration date. As part of its restructuring initiatives in 2001, management approved and committed the Company to in source services provided by Accenture under the ITSA. In December 2001, Ryder and Accenture entered into a written agreement to transition certain IT services previously delivered by Accenture under contract to Ryder. Under this agreement, Ryder agreed to waive any right to reimbursement of approximately $3 million in unamortized prepaid expenses related to the ITSA. The Companys strategic initiatives during 2001 resulted in asset write downs to fair value less cost to sell of approximately $4 million for facilities that were identified for closure and held for sale pursuant to the initiatives. At such time, the Company had the ability to remove the facilities from operations upon identification of a buyer or receipt of an acceptable bid. Fair value was determined based on appraisals of these properties. Also, as part of the strategic initiatives, the Company wrote down investments in e commerce assets of $3 million, including specialized property and equipment and software, that were terminated or abandoned during 2001 and for which the fair value of such investments was zero. Additionally, during 2001, an investment of $6 million in certain license agreements for supply chain management software was written down. The write down consisted of the unamortized cost of licenses and related software development costs previously capitalized for which development was abandoned as a result of the Companys restructuring initiatives. Since the software licenses would no 19 longer be used in the business nor could the licenses be resold by the Company, such licenses were valued at zero. Due to the decision to shut down the aforementioned Systemcare operations, the Company assessed the recoverability of Systemcares long lived assets held for use as described in Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Impairment of Long Lived Assets in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Assets of $2 million, consisting primarily of specialized vehicles to be disposed of after the shutdown of Systemcares operations, were considered impaired and written down because estimated fair values were less than the carrying values of the assets. Fair values were determined based on internal valuations of similar assets. Goodwill Impairment: The Company also identified certain operating units for which current circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of long lived assets, in particular, goodwill, may not be recoverable. The Company assessed the recoverability of these long lived assets and determined that the goodwill related to these operating units was not recoverable. See Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the Companys policy on impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. Impairment charges in 2001, all of which related to SCS operating units, are summarized as follows: (In thousands) Systemcare UK home delivery network $ 10,602 Ryder Argentina 9,130 Ryder Brazil 3,706 Other 987 Total $ 24,425 As part of the decision to shut down the aforementioned Systemcare operations, goodwill of $11 million was considered impaired and written down during 2001. Goodwill impairment in Ryder Argentina was triggered by the significant adverse change in the business climate in Argentina in the fourth quarter of 2001 that led to a devaluation of the Argentine Peso, breakdowns in the Argentine banking system and repeated turnover in the countrys leadership. These factors, combined with a history of operating losses and anticipated future operating losses, led to goodwill impairment. Goodwill of $9 million was considered impaired and was written down in December 2001. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company reviewed goodwill associated with its remaining investment in Ryder Brazil for impairment. Subsequent to the sale of the contracts and related net assets associated with the disposal of the Companys outbound auto carriage business (Vehiculos) in Ryder Brazil discussed below, the Company made a significant effort to restructure the operations of Ryder Brazil. However, such restructuring was not sufficient to offset the impact of lost business, the impact of the Argentine economic crisis and the marginal historical and anticipated cash flows related to the remaining business. As a result of the Companys analysis, goodwill of $4 million was considered impaired and was written down in December 2001. Strategic consulting fees: Strategic consulting fees of $9 million were incurred during 2001 in relation to the aforementioned strategic initiatives. Such consulting fees represented one time costs of engaging consultants to assist the Company in its restructuring initiatives in 2001. Loss on sale of business: During March 2001, the Company sold Vehiculos in Ryder Brazil for $14 million and incurred a loss of $4 million on the sale of the business. Contract termination costs: In connection with the agreement to in source information technology services provided by Accenture, the Company agreed to pay termination fees and certain demobilization costs of 20 approximately $8 million. Also during 2001, the Company made a decision to terminate a long term marketing arrangement to reduce marketing costs. Insurance reserves sold business: During 2001, the Company recognized $3 million in recoveries from an insurance settlement attributed to a business sold in 1989. The insurance recovery represents an adjustment to the Companys indemnification reserve for favorable actuarial developments since the time of the sale. Gain on sale of corporate aircraft: As a direct result of the Companys 2001 restructuring and cost reduction initiatives, the Company decided to sell its corporate aircraft. The Company sold the aircraft during the first quarter of 2001 and recorded a $2 million gain on the sale. 2000 Charges In 2000, severance and employee related costs of $1 million that had been recorded in the 1999 restructuring were reversed due to refinements in estimates. Facilities and related costs reflect $2 million of net gains (recoveries) on sale of owned facilities identified for closure in the 1999 and 1996 restructuring. In 2000, an asset write down of $41 million resulted from the rapid industry wide downturn in the market for new and used Class 8 vehicles (the largest heavy duty tractors) which led to a decrease in the market value of used tractors during the second half of 2000. The Companys unsold Class 8 inventory consists of units previously used by customers of the FMS segment. Approximately $15 million of the charge related to Class 8 tractors held for sale and identified in 2000 as increasingly undesirable and unmarketable due to lower powered engines or a potential lack of future support for parts and service. The remainder of the charge related to other owned and leased tractors held for sale for which estimated fair value less costs to sell declined below carrying value (or termination value, which represents the final payment due to lessors, in the case of leased units) in 2000. These charges were slightly offset with gains of $1 million on vehicles sold in the U.K. during 2000, for which an impairment charge had been recorded in the 1999 restructuring. During 2000, the Company settled long standing litigation with a former customer, OfficeMax, relating to a logistics services agreement that was terminated in 1997. In 2000, asset write downs include $4 million related to the write down, net of recoveries, of certain assets related to the OfficeMax contract. A charge of $1 million for consulting fees was incurred during 2000 related to the completion of the Companys 1999 profitability improvement study. Also during 2000, the Company recorded a $1 million charge for an adjustment to the Companys indemnification reserve associated with the aforementioned insurance settlement and a $1 million reversal of certain other charges recorded in the 1999 restructuring. 21 OPERATING RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (In thousands) Revenue: Fleet Management Solutions: Full service lease and program maintenance $ 1,795,254 1,855,865 1,865,345 Commercial rental 458,355 468,438 523,776 Fuel 582,643 658,325 773,320 Other 346,770 369,912 393,549 3,183,022 3,352,540 3,555,990 Supply Chain Solutions 1,388,299 1,453,881 1,595,252 Dedicated Contract Carriage 517,961 534,962 551,706 Eliminations (313,017 ) (335,260 ) (366,156 ) Total $ 4,776,265 5,006,123 5,336,792 NBT: Fleet Management Solutions $ 214,384 194,398 225,088 Supply Chain Solutions (6,221 ) (6,760 ) 10,035 Dedicated Contract Carriage 31,157 34,755 37,282 Eliminations (34,636 ) (36,989 ) (41,888 ) 204,684 185,404 230,517 Unallocated Central Support Services (24,585 ) (25,396 ) (35,522 ) Goodwill Amortization (12,738 ) (11,660 ) Earnings before restructuring and other charges, taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 180,099 147,270 183,335 Restructuring and other charges, net (4,216 ) (116,564 ) (42,014 ) Earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle $ 175,883 30,706 141,321 Beginning in the first quarter of 2002, the primary measurement of segment financial performance, defined as Net Before Tax (NBT), includes an allocation of Central Support Services (CSS) and excludes goodwill impairment, goodwill amortization and restructuring and other charges, net. Prior year segment results have been restated to conform to the new measurement standard. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including sales and marketing, human resources, finance, corporate services shared management information systems, customer solutions, health and safety, legal and communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. To facilitate the comparison of 2002 business segment NBT to prior periods, prior year goodwill amortization is now treated as a corporate, rather than segment, cost and is segregated as such. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, corporate communications, public affairs and certain executive compensation. 22 The FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to the SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenues and NBT are accounted for at approximate fair value as if the transactions were made with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) is included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for the Companys SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (In millions) Supply Chain Solutions $ 16 17 20 Dedicated Contract Carriage 19 20 22 Total $ 35 37 42 Interest expense is primarily allocated to the FMS business segment since such borrowings are used principally to fund the purchase of revenue earning equipment used in FMS; however, with the availability of segment balance sheet information in 2002 (including targeted segment leverage ratios), interest expense (income) is also reflected in SCS and DCC. These segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Fleet Management Solutions FMS revenue decreased 5 percent to $3.2 billion in 2002 compared with 2001. Results in 2002 were impacted by decreases in fuel services revenue. Dry revenue (revenue excluding fuel) decreased 3 percent in 2002 compared with 2001 reflecting revenue declines in leasing and commercial rental revenue. Full service lease and program maintenance revenue decreased 3 percent to $1.8 billion in 2002 compared with 2001. The decrease was primarily due to the weak U.S. economy as well as decreases in variable billings, which are generally a function of total miles run by leased vehicles. The Company anticipates unfavorable full service lease and program maintenance revenue comparisons to continue over the near term. Full service lease and program maintenance revenue may improve in the latter half of 2003 due to an increased emphasis on new sales and business retention and the expected improvement of the U.S. economy. All elements of commercial rental revenue (consisting of pure rental, lease extra and await new lease revenue) decreased in 2002 compared with 2001 reflecting slow economic conditions and a planned rental fleet reduction, which offset improved rental utilization and pricing. However, commercial rental revenue comparisons have steadily improved in 2002 and, in the fourth quarter of 2002, revenue grew 6 percent compared with the year earlier period, marking the first rental revenue improvement in 10 quarters. U.S. rental fleet utilization improved to 76 percent in 2002 compared with 66 percent in 2001. In the U.S., pure rental revenue (total rental revenue less rental revenue related to units provided to full service lease customers) decreased 4 percent to $177 million in 2002 compared with 2001 due to the continued softness in the U.S. economy. Lease extra revenue represents revenue on rental vehicles provided to existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. In the U.S., lease extra revenue decreased 8 percent to $107 million in 2002 compared with the prior year. Await new lease revenue represents revenue on rental vehicles provided to new full service lease customers who have not taken delivery of full service lease units. In 2002, await new lease revenue of $18 million marginally declined in the U.S. in comparison to prior year. The U.S. commercial rental fleet size declined 8 percent in 2002 as compared with 2001. Rental statistics are monitored for the U.S. only; however, management believes such metrics to be indicative of rental product performance for the Company as a whole. The Company expects commercial rental revenue to improve in 2003 based on positive revenue trends experienced in the second half of 2002 and the expected improvement of the U.S. economy in 2003. 23 FMS revenue decreased 6 percent to $3.4 billion in 2001 compared with 2000. Dry revenue decreased 3 percent in 2001 compared with 2000 reflecting revenue declines in commercial rental revenue. Full service lease and program maintenance remained relatively flat in 2001 compared with 2000. All elements of commercial rental revenue decreased in 2001 compared with 2000 as a result of lower utilization, a decrease in the number of units in the rental fleet and shorter lead times to place full service lease vehicles into service compared with 2000. U.S. rental fleet utilization was 66 percent in 2001 compared with 71 percent in 2000. The U.S. commercial rental fleet size declined 8 percent in 2001 as compared with 2000. Fuel services revenue declined 11 percent to $583 million in 2002 compared with 2001, as a result of lower volume and pricing, particularly during the first half of 2002. Fuel services revenue decreased 15 percent in 2001 compared with 2000 due to lower volume and pricing. Other transportation services revenue, consisting of non contractual third party maintenance, trailer rentals and other ancillary revenue to support product lines decreased 6 percent in 2002 and 2001, compared with prior years. FMS NBT increased 10 percent to $214 million in 2002 compared with 2001. The increase was due primarily to improved rental utilization, lower interest expense and operating expense reductions due to cost management and process improvement initiatives since last year. NBT for 2002 also benefited from lower carrying costs on used vehicles held for sale (owned and leased) because of reduced vehicle counts and, to a lesser extent, improved pricing on tractor sales. Such improvements were partially offset by increased pension expense of $23 million in 2002 over 2001. FMS NBT as a percentage of dry revenue was 8 percent in 2002 compared with 7 percent in 2001. FMS NBT decreased 14 percent to $194 million in 2001 compared with 2000. FMS NBT as a percentage of dry revenue was 7 percent in 2001 compared with 8 percent in 2000. The decrease in 2001 was attributable to the decrease in gains from the sale of equipment due to weakened used truck market demand, lower net pension income in 2001 compared with 2000 and decreased rental profitability resulting from the decline in rental revenue. Pension income attributable to FMS decreased by more than $33 million in 2001 compared with 2000. The Companys fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): December 31 Number of Units 2002 2001 By type: Trucks 62,200 66,000 Tractors 48,800 52,400 Trailers 44,800 46,700 Other 5,600 5,000 Total 161,400 170,100 By business: Full service lease 120,900 126,900 Commercial rental 37,600 40,200 Service and other vehicles 2,900 3,000 Total 161,400 170,100 Owned 124,800 117,700 Leased 36,600 52,400 Total 161,400 170,100 24 The totals in each of the tables above include the following non revenue earning equipment (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): December 31 Number of Units 2002 2001 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 1,100 1,200 No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale 3,500 5,200 Other NLE units 3,500 4,700 Total 8,100 11,100 NYE units represent new units on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration units. NLE units represent units held for sale, as well as other units for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. These vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or not rented due to lack of demand. The total number of units not earning revenue of 8,100 units is at a 48 month low due to the Companys efforts to redeploy surplus units and the continued downsizing of the commercial rental fleet. Supply Chain Solutions SCS revenue in 2002 decreased 5 percent to $1.4 billion compared with 2001. Operating revenue (which excludes FUM) decreased 4 percent in 2002 compared with 2001. The declines in revenue for 2002 reflect volume reductions in the electronics, high tech and telecommunications and consumer products operating units as a result of the slowdown in the U.S. economy in general and those sectors specifically. The revenue decline was also impacted by the non renewal of certain customer contracts and the currency devaluation and economic downturn in Argentina. Such revenue decreases were partially offset by new and expanded business in the automotive sector in the Companys U.S. and European operations. Overall, in light of these factors, the Company expects unfavorable revenue comparisons to continue over the near term. SCS revenue decreased 9 percent to $1.5 billion in 2001 compared with 2000 mostly due to volume reductions in North America and Latin America as a result of the continued worldwide economic slowdown. In North America, volume reductions were experienced in the Companys automotive and electronics, high tech and telecommunications operating units due to slowed consumer demand in those sectors combined with the non renewal of certain customer contracts 2001. Volume decreases in Latin America were due to the slowing economies in Brazil and Argentina and to the sale of Brazils outbound auto carriage business in 2001. Additionally, revenue reductions occurred in 2001 due to the impact of exchange rates on translation of foreign subsidiaries. SCS NBT improved 8 percent to a deficit of $6 million in 2002 from a deficit of $7 million in 2001. SCS NBT as a percentage of operating revenue was negative 0.6 percent in 2002 compared with negative 0.7 percent in 2001. SCS NBT was negatively impacted by facility lease termination charges of $3 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2002, reduced revenue and higher overhead spending. The increased overhead spending was due to increased costs associated with profit improvement initiatives and higher employee benefit costs. These decreases were partially offset by new and expanded profitable business in the automotive and electronics, high tech and telecommunications operating units, improvement in SCS European operations and continued benefits from margin improvement initiatives, including the elimination of certain unprofitable business and the implementation of cost containment controls. SCS NBT decreased to a deficit of $7 million in 2001 compared with earnings of $10 million in 2000. The decrease in NBT was due primarily to the previously mentioned volume reductions as a result of the economic downturn, the non renewal of customer contracts and increased operating costs, particularly related to the Companys transportation management operations. NBT as a percentage of operating revenue was negative 0.7 percent in 2001 compared with 0.9 percent in 2000. 25 Dedicated Contract Carriage DCC revenue in 2002 decreased 3 percent to $518 million compared with the same period in 2001. NBT decreased 10 percent to $31 million in 2002 compared with 2001. The decrease in revenue was due primarily to the non renewal of unprofitable business partially offset by new business in 2002. The decrease in NBT for 2002 reflects increased overhead spending partially offset by the non renewal of unprofitable business and margin improvements in other operational areas. Higher sales and marketing costs, salaries and employee related costs and insurance costs contributed to the higher overhead spending. NBT as a percentage of operating revenue was 6 percent in 2002 compared with 7 percent in 2001. DCC revenue decreased 3 percent in 2001 compared with 2000. NBT decreased 7 percent to $35 million in 2001 compared with 2000. The decreases were due primarily to volume reductions as a result of the current economic downturn and lost business. NBT as a percentage of operating revenue (which excludes FUM) was 7 percent in 2001 and 2000. Central Support Services CSS expenses were as follows: Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (In thousands) Sales and marketing $ 12,636 15,045 20,292 Human resources 21,151 21,911 21,001 Finance 55,516 53,464 57,097 Corporate services/public affairs 7,672 8,023 10,099 Information technology 81,631 98,373 99,471 Customer solutions 7,845 13,280 19,297 Health and safety 9,192 9,046 9,840 Other 37,789 26,082 27,933 Total CSS 233,432 245,224 265,030 Allocation of CSS to business segments 208,847 219,828 229,508 Unallocated CSS $ 24,585 25,396 35,522 CSS decreased 5 percent to $233 million in 2002 compared with 2001. The decrease in total CSS expense was due primarily to reductions in several elements of CSS expense as a result of the Companys continued cost containment actions, most notably in information technology (IT). Technology costs were lower in 2002 due primarily to lower costs resulting from in sourcing of certain IT services combined with decreased development and support costs as a result of the cancellation of an FMS IT project in the third quarter of 2001. Such decreases were partially offset by higher incentive compensation due to the improved overall Company performance. CSS decreased 7 percent to $245 million in 2001 compared with 2000. The decrease in total CSS expense were due primarily to spending reductions in sales and marketing, corporate services and customer solutions as a result of the expense reduction initiatives. These initiatives included terminating the Companys sponsorship of the Doral Ryder Open, the sale of the Companys corporate aircraft and reducing the spending rate for new technology projects. CSS costs attributable to the business segments are generally allocated to FMS, SCS and DCC as follows: Sales and marketing, finance, corporate services and health and safety allocated based upon estimated and planned resource utilization. Human resources individual costs within this category are allocated in several ways, including allocation based on estimated utilization and number of personnel supported. Information Technology allocated principally based upon utilization related metrics such as number of users or minutes of CPU time. 26 Customer Solutions represents project costs and expenses incurred in excess of amounts billable to customers during the period. Expenses are allocated to the business segment responsible for the project. Other represents purchasing, legal, and other centralized costs and expenses including certain incentive compensation costs. Expenses, where allocated, are based primarily on the number of personnel supported. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of the Companys cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 632,787 308,702 1,015,533 Financing activities (269,508 ) (319,699 ) (363,599 ) Investing activities (376,908 ) 6,893 (642,957 ) Net cash flows from operations $ (13,629 ) (4,104 ) 8,977 A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2002 compared with 2001 was attributable to a reduction in overall working capital needs, changes in the aggregate balance of trade receivables sold and improved operating performance. The lower working capital needs in 2002 related primarily to lower levels of business activity as reflected in decreased revenue compared with the prior year. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2002 compared with the prior year reflects increased proceeds from stock option exercises, principally during the first half of 2002, and lower debt repayments. The increase in cash used in investing activities reflects proceeds of $411 million from a vehicle securitization in 2001 partially offset with a reduction in capital expenditures in 2002. The decrease in cash flow from operating activities in 2001 compared with 2000 was primarily attributable to changes in the aggregate balance of trade receivables sold. Cash used in financing activities slightly decreased in 2001 compared with 2000. In 2001, lower net commercial paper borrowings were virtually offset by higher utilization of other more cost effective funding facilities as compared with the commercial paper program. The increase in cash provided by investing activities in 2001 compared with 2000 was attributable to lower capital expenditures in 2001. Higher proceeds provided from the sale leaseback of revenue earning equipment in 2001 (see Off balance Sheet Arrangements) were offset by decreased proceeds from the sales of property and revenue earning equipment primarily due to lower volumes and the continued weak demand in the used truck market. The Company refers to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities, excluding changes in the aggregate balance of trade receivables sold, and including collections on direct finance leases, proceeds from sale of assets and capital expenditures as free cash flow. The following table shows the sources of the Companys free cash flow: 27 Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (In thousands) Cash provided by operating activities $ 632,787 308,702 1,015,533 Changes in the aggregate balance of trade receivables sold 110,000 235,000 (270,000 ) Collections on direct finance leases 66,489 66,204 67,462 Sales of property and revenue earning equipment 152,685 175,134 229,908 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (600,301 ) (656,597 ) (1,288,784 ) Net free cash flows $ 361,660 128,443 (245,881 ) The increase in free cash flow in 2002 compared with 2001 was primarily attributable to a reduction in overall working capital needs and improved operating performance. The decrease in working capital is attributable in part to lower levels of business activity in 2002 as reflected in decreased revenue compared with the prior year. The Company expects free cash flow to decline in 2003 as a result of the increased capital spending requirements discussed below. The increase in free cash flow in 2001 compared with 2000 was primarily attributable to a reduction in net capital spending levels offset by lower operating performance and increased overall working capital needs. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment* $ 556,328 579,320 1,186,787 Operating property and equipment 43,973 77,277 101,997 Total $ 600,301 656,597 1,288,784 * 2002 excludes non cash additions of $67 million in assets held under capital lease resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. The decreases in capital expenditures in 2002 and 2001 were due primarily to reduced market demand, improved controls over capital expenditures and a reduction in the volume of early replacements of full service leases compared with 2000. The Company has worked to improve controls over capital expenditures and reduce the volume of early terminations of full service leases over the past two years. As part of its initiatives, the Company successfully implemented a strategy of extending certain full service leases rather than leasing new units, which has allowed the Company to further control capital expenditures while frequently providing customers with vehicles at favorable pre owned rates compared with rates on new units. Capital expenditures are anticipated to increase to approximately $890 million in 2003 as a result of higher levels of vehicle replacements. The Company expects to fund 2003 capital expenditures with internally generated funds and borrowings. No acquisitions were completed in 2002 or 2001. During 2000, the Company completed a few immaterial acquisitions, each of which was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Total consideration for these acquisitions was $28 million. The Company will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2003. Financing and Other Funding Transactions The Company utilizes external capital to support growth in its asset based product lines. The Company has a variety of financing alternatives available to fund its capital needs. These alternatives include long term and 28 medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities, commercial paper and sale of receivable program. Total debt was $1.6 billion at December 31, 2002, a decrease of 9 percent from December 31, 2001. The Company issued $150 million of medium term notes and retired $166 million of medium term notes in 2002. U.S. commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2002 decreased to $118 million, compared with $210 million at December 31, 2001. During 2002, the Company added capital lease obligations of $67 million primarily in connection with the extension of existing operating leases of revenue earning equipment. The Companys foreign debt was $238 million at December 31, 2002, a decrease of approximately $104 million from December 31, 2001. The Companys percentage of variable rate financing obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 37 percent at December 31, 2002, compared with 27 percent at December 31, 2001. Generally, the Company targets a variable rate exposure of 25 to 45 percent of total obligations. Debt totaled $1.7 billion at the end of 2001 compared with $2.0 billion at the end of 2000. The decrease in debt in 2001 was principally due to repayment of $100 million in debentures and a decrease of $231 million in commercial paper borrowings, which were repaid with proceeds of sale leaseback transactions described below. In addition to the Companys reduced debt in 2001, receivables sold decreased $235 million in 2001 compared with 2000. Decreased debt levels and reduced overall funding needs were generally the result of reduced levels of capital expenditures on revenue earning equipment. The Companys debt to equity and related ratios were as follows: December 31 2002 2001 (In thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 1,551,468 1,708,684 Debt to equity 140 % 139 % Total obligations excluding securitizations 1,921,905 2,443,104 Total obligations to equity excluding securitizations 173 % 199 % Total obligations including securitizations 2,232,860 2,884,483 Total obligations to equity including securitizations 201 % 234 % Debt to equity consists of the Companys on balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents debt plus the following off balance sheet funding, all divided by total equity: (1) receivables sold, and (2) the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for equipment, discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease. Total obligations to equity, including securitizations, consists of total obligations, described above, plus the present value of contingent rentals under the Companys securitizations (assuming customers make all lease payments on securitized vehicles when contractually due), discounted at the average interest rate paid to investors in the trust, all divided by total equity. Off balance sheet obligations with special purpose entities, primarily securitizations, were approximately $381 million and $536 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. All leverage ratios in 2002 were impacted by a non cash equity charge of $228 million (after tax) recorded as of December 31, 2002 in connection with additional minimum pension liability adjustments see Pension Information below for additional discussion. Excluding the pension equity charge, all ratios declined in 2002 as a result of the Companys reduced funding needs attributable to decreases in purchases of revenue earning equipment. For 2003, the Company anticipates these ratios to increase as a result of higher anticipated capital spending. The Company participates in an agreement, as amended from time to time, to sell with limited recourse, trade receivables on a revolving and uncommitted basis. This agreement expires in July 2004. In June 2002, the Company reduced the amount available for sale under its trade receivable facility from $375 million to $275 million as a result of a reduction in overall capital needs. The Company sells receivables in order to fund operations, 29 particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other means of funding, notably, commercial paper. Receivables are sold first to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, Ryder Receivables Funding LLC (RRF LLC), that is included in the Companys consolidated financial statements. RRF LLC then sells certain receivables to unrelated commercial entities at a loss, which approximates the purchasers financing cost of issuing its own commercial paper backed by the trade receivables over the period of anticipated collection. The Company is responsible for servicing receivables sold, but has no retained interests. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the outstanding balance of receivables sold pursuant to this agreement was $0 and $110 million, respectively. Losses on receivable sales associated with this program were $2 million in 2002, $9 million in 2001 and $17 million in 2000 and are included in miscellaneous (income) expense, net. RRF LLC records estimates of losses under the recourse provision which are included in accrued liabilities. Since no receivables were sold at the end of 2002, no amount of available recourse or recognized recourse obligation existed as of December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2001, the amount of available recourse was $14 million and the estimated losses under the recourse obligation attributed to receivables sold were $1 million. The decrease in trade receivables sold since December 31, 2001 is due to a reduced need for cash as a result of lower working capital needs. See Receivables in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion on the Companys sale of receivables. The Companys ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both its short and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Company securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from the Company or other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. The Companys debt ratings as of December 31, 2002 were as follows: Short Long Term Term Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Standard Poors Ratings Group A2 BBB Fitch Ratings F2 BBB On December 19, 2001, Moodys Investor Service confirmed the Companys long term debt rating and changed its long term debt rating outlook to negative. The Companys debt ratings have remained unchanged since the first quarter of 2001. A downgrade of the Companys debt below investment grade level would limit the Companys ability to issue commercial paper and would result in the Company no longer having the ability to sell trade receivables under the agreement described above or participate in existing derivative transactions. As a result, the Company would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. The Company has established an $860 million global revolving credit facility. The facility is composed of $300 million which matures in May 2003 and is renewable annually (and is in the process of being renewed), and $560 million which matures in May 2006. The primary purposes of the credit facility are to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. At the Companys option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys annual facility fee ranges from 12.5 to 15.0 basis points applied to the total facility of $860 million based on the Companys current credit ratings. At December 31, 2002, $674 million was available under this global credit facility. Of this amount, $300 million was available at a maturity of less than one year. Foreign borrowings of $68 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2002. In order to maintain availability of funding, the global revolving credit facility requires the Company to maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined, of less than or equal to 300 percent. The ratio at December 31, 2002 was 119 percent. In September 1998, the Company filed an $800 million shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Proceeds from debt issues under the shelf registration have been and are expected to 30 be used for capital expenditures, debt refinancing and general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2002, the Company had $187 million of debt securities available for issuance under this shelf registration statement. As of December 31, 2002 the Company had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility ($300 limited to less than one year) $ 674 Shelf registration statement 187 Trade receivables facility uncommitted 275 The Company believes such facilities, along with other funding sources, will be sufficient to fund operations in 2003. Off balance Sheet Arrangements In addition to the financing activities described above, the Company executes sale leaseback transactions with third party financial institutions as well as with substantive special purpose entities (SPEs) which facilitate sale leaseback transactions with multiple third party investors (vehicle securitizations). In general, sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Sale leaseback transactions (including vehicle securitizations) are generally executed from time to time in order to lower the total cost of funding the Companys operations, to diversify the Companys funding among different classes of investors (e.g. regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.), and to diversify the Companys funding among different types of funding instruments. The Company did not enter into any sale leaseback or securitization transactions during the year ended December 31, 2002. Proceeds from sale leaseback transactions were $411 million and $373 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Under the transactions, the vehicles were sold for approximately their carrying value. The sale leaseback transaction in 2001 was a vehicle securitization in which the Company sold a beneficial interest in certain vehicles subject to leases to a separately rated and unconsolidated vehicle lease trust and subsequently entered into an operating lease (program operating lease) with the trust. A prospectus for the transaction is on file with the SEC. The Company has executed other similar vehicle securitization transactions in previous years. The Company retained an interest in the vehicle lease trust in the form of subordinated notes issued at the date of the sale. The Company has provided credit enhancement for the sale in the form of a one time up front cash reserve deposit and a pledge of the subordinated notes, including interest thereon, as additional security for the vehicle securitization trusts to the extent that payments under the program operating lease are not made due to delinquencies and incurred losses under the program operating lease and related vehicle sales. The trust relies on collections from the program operating lease, sales proceeds from the disposition of such vehicles and credit enhancements to make payments to investors. The trust is solely liable for such payments to investors, who are all independent of the Company. Other than the credit enhancement noted above, the Company does not guarantee investors interests in the securitization trust. See Leases in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion on the Companys securitization transactions. 31 The following table summarizes the Companys undiscounted on and off balance sheet contractual cash obligations and contingent rentals at December 31, 2002: 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Long term debt $ 139,769 165,490 208,438 383,458 235,761 347,787 1,480,703 Capital leases 22,600 37,960 9,912 293 70,765 Total debt 162,369 203,450 218,350 383,751 235,761 347,787 1,551,468 Operating leases (a) 297,964 128,679 75,079 53,914 41,650 56,393 653,679 Total contractual cash obligations 460,333 332,129 293,429 437,665 277,411 404,180 2,205,147 Contingent rentals (b) 101,898 89,371 65,805 29,077 6,608 690 293,449 Total $ 562,231 421,500 359,234 466,742 284,019 404,870 2,498,596 (a) The amounts in the previous table are based upon the assumption that revenue earning equipment will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes, except as described below for vehicle securitization transactions. (b) Contingent rentals relate to the Companys vehicle securitization transactions. The timing and amount of payment of rent by the Company for securitized vehicles is dependent on the timing and amount of payments received from the Companys customers for use of such vehicles, as stipulated by the program operating lease. For purposes of this presentation, the Company has assumed that the full monthly payment for each vehicle is received from the customer exactly when such payment is due, and that there are no defaults, prepayments or early termination of leases between the Company and its customers. Contingent rentals in the table above are estimated based upon this assumption. The actual amount and timing of contingent rentals due by the Company may vary from that assumed above. Guarantees In the ordinary course of business, the Company provides certain guarantees or indemnifications to third parties as part of certain lease, financing and sales agreements. Certain guarantees and indemnifications, whereby the Company may be contingently required to make a payment to a third party, are required to be disclosed even if the likelihood of payment is considered remote. The Companys financial guarantees as of December 31, 2002 consisted of the following: Maximum exposure Carrying amount Guarantee of guarantee of liability (In millions) Vehicle residual value guarantees: Sale and leaseback arrangements end of term guarantees (a) $ 203 19 Finance lease program 4 1 Used vehicle financing 7 4 Standby letters of credit 15 Total $ 229 24 (a) Amounts exclude contingent rentals associated with residual value guarantees on certain vehicles held under operating leases for which the guarantees are conditional upon early termination of the lease agreement as a result of a vehicle disposal. The Companys maximum exposure for early lease termination guarantees was approximately $184 million, with $9 million recorded as a liability at December 31, 2002. 32 As more fully described in the Leases Note to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has entered into transactions for the sale and operating leaseback of revenue earning equipment. The transactions resulted in the Company providing the lessors with residual value guarantees at the end of the lease term. Therefore, to the extent that the sales proceeds from the final disposition of the assets are lower than the residual value guarantee, the Company is required to make payment for the remaining amount. The Companys maximum exposure for such guarantees, including credit enhancements on vehicle securitizations, was approximately $203 million, with $19 million recorded as a liability at December 31, 2002. Under a separate arrangement, the Company also provides vehicle residual value guarantees to an independent third party relating to a customer finance lease program. To the extent that the sales proceeds from the final disposition of the assets are lower than the residual value guarantee, the Company is required to make payment for the remaining amount. At December 31, 2002, the Companys maximum exposure under this program was approximately $4 million, of which $1 million was recorded. The Company maintains an agreement with an independent third party for the financing of used vehicle purchases by its customers. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company finances the customers purchase and immediately sells its rights under the finance contract to the financial institution. The Company provides a guarantee on defaulted contracts up to a maximum of 11 percent of the outstanding principal balances. At the end of 2002, the Companys maximum exposure under the guarantee was approximately $7 million. The recorded liability under this guarantee at December 31, 2002 was $4 million. At December 31, 2002, the Company had outstanding letters of credit that primarily guarantee various insurance activities. Certain of these letters of credit guarantee insurance activities associated with insurance claim liabilities transferred in conjunction with the sale of certain businesses reported as discontinued operations in previous years. To date, such insurance claims, representing per claim deductibles payable under third party insurance policies, have been paid by the companies that assumed such liabilities. However, if all or a portion of such assumed claims are unable to be paid, the third party insurers may have recourse against certain of the outstanding letters of credit provided by the Company in order to satisfy the unpaid claims deductible. No liability has been recorded by the Company for its guarantee of such claims, however, the total assumed liabilities in which the Company guarantees payment was estimated to be approximately $15 million at December 31, 2002. Pension Information As of December 31, 2002, the Company recorded a non cash equity charge of $228 million (after tax) in connection with the accrual of an additional minimum pension liability. The equity charge reflects the under funded status of the Companys qualified pension plans (primarily U.S. qualified plan) resulting from declines in the market value of equity securities and declines in long term interest rates. Although this non cash charge impacts reported leverage ratios, it does not affect the Companys compliance with existing financial debt covenants. The funded status of the Companys pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of market interest rates. While the Company is not legally required to make a contribution to fund its U.S. pension plan until September 2004, it reviews pension assumptions regularly and may from time to time make contributions to its pension plans. The Company made pension contributions of $26 million to global pension plans in 2002. The Company estimates the present value of its required pension plan contributions over the next 5 years to be approximately $140 million for the U.S. pension plan, its primary plan. Market Risk In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and fuel prices. The Company manages such exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. The Company does not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. The Companys interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. The Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, the Company also uses 33 interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage its fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of its debt instruments to that of its portfolio of assets. See Financial Instruments and Risk Management Note to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2002, the Company had $878 million of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7 percent and a fair value of $964 million, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10 percent decrease or increase in the December 31, 2002 market interest rates would impact the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt by approximately $18 million. At December 31, 2001, the Company had $1.2 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.4 percent and a fair value of $1.2 billion. A hypothetical 10 percent decrease or increase in the December 31, 2001 market interest rates would impact the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt by approximately $17 million. The Company estimates the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2002, the Company had $603 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $322 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7 percent to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 3.0 percent. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2002 totaled $24 million. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had $459 million of variable rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 3.3 percent. Interest expense under the majority of these arrangements are based on LIBOR. The Company currently estimates that a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would impact pre tax income by $2 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The Company manages its exposure to foreign exchange rate risk related to foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. The Company also uses foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. The Company does not generally hedge the translation exposure related to its net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since the Company generally has no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Based on the overall level of transactions denominated in other than local currencies, the lack of transactions between the Company and its foreign subsidiaries and the level of net investment in foreign subsidiaries, the exposure to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates is not considered material. At December 31, 2002, the Company had a $78 million cross currency swap outstanding used to hedge its investment in a foreign subsidiary. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a portion of the Companys service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. None of the Companys current fuel purchase arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased and as such the Company is exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to customers and have only a minor effect on profitability. The Company believes the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of the Company involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require the Company to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, the Company has upgraded operating facilities and implemented various programs to detect and minimize contamination. 34 Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million, $2 million and $2 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company incurred environmental expenses of $10 million, $7 million and $5 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses, such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. The increase in environmental expense in 2002 and 2001 reflected the impact of lower claim recoveries compared with the prior year. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses should not increase materially from 2002 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of the Companys environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, management believes that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or liquidity. See Environmental Matters in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. ACCOUNTING MATTERS Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. The Companys significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely, can result in a material impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. Management periodically reviews the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the Companys Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that management considers to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees: The Company periodically reviews and adjusts the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of its FMS business segment as described in Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values the price at which the Company ultimately expects to dispose of revenue earning equipment or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. The Company reviews residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. The Company considers such factors as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g. rental fleet, SCS and DCC applications). In its estimates, the Company also makes certain assumptions in establishing residual values with respect to future market price trends and the expected recovery of the existing weak used truck market. As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2002, a 10 percent decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2003 by approximately $52 million. The Company also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees 35 expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2002, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $28 million were included in accrued expenses (for those payable in less than one year) and in other non current liabilities. While management believes that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2002, a 10 percent decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2003 by approximately $6 million. Pension Plans: The Company applies actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, the Company reviews actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and makes adjustments to the assumptions, if warranted. In determining its annual estimate of net periodic pension cost, the Company is required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return and expected increase in compensation levels. Discount rates are based upon an expected benefit payments duration analysis and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of the Companys asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon salary experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between actual and assumed experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized gain or loss in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company currently has an unrecognized loss of $404 million, of which a portion will be amortized into earnings in 2003. The effect on years beyond 2003 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of the plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2002 net pension expense is presented in the Employee Benefit Plans Note to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2003 net periodic pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for the Companys primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Impact on 2003 Net Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Discount rate 6.50 % / 0.25 % / $5 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.75 % / 0.25 % / $2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 5.00 % / 0.50 % / $1 million Self Insurance Reserves: Management uses a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, management considers such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of the Companys business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of the Companys business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of the Companys self insurance reserves for reasonableness. The Companys estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While management believes that self insurance reserves are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to managements estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance reserves at December 31, 2002, a 5 percent adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2003 by approximately $10 million. 36 Goodwill Impairment: The Company assesses goodwill for impairment, as described in Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Note to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, the Company is required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. The Companys valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on managements knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions it expects to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions management expects to take. While management believes its estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. At December 31, 2002, the total amount of goodwill was $151 million. Income Taxes: The Company records a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. In determining the required level of the valuation allowance, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Should the Company change its estimate of the amount of its deferred tax assets that it would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. At December 31, 2002, the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $14 million. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and or normal use of the assets. When the liability is initially recorded, the Company is required to capitalize a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. SFAS No. 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002 and will be adopted by the Company effective January 1, 2003. The Company believes the adoption of SFAS No. 143 will not have a significant impact on its results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. The standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit (including restructuring) or disposal activities at fair value when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan under current practice. Costs covered by the standard include certain contract termination costs, certain employee termination benefits and other costs to consolidate or close facilities and relocate employees that are associated with an exit activity or disposal of long lived assets. The new requirements are effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002 and will be adopted by the Company effective January 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 146 is expected to impact the timing of recognition of costs associated with future exit and disposal activities. In November 2002, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation (FIN) No. 45, Guarantors Accounting Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN No. 45 clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN No. 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements of FIN No. 45 are applicable for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002, which is included in the Guarantees Note to Consolidated Financial Statements. 37 In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This Statement amends methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements. Certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002 and are included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities that establishes accounting guidance for identifying variable interest entities (VIEs), including special purpose entities, and when to include the assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests and results of activities of VIEs in an enterprises consolidated financial statements. FIN No. 46 requires consolidation of VIEs if the primary beneficiary has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests) that will absorb a majority of the entitys expected losses if the they occur, receive a majority of the entitys expected residual returns if they occur, or both. The enterprise consolidating the VIE is the primary beneficiary of that entity. FIN No. 46 will be effective immediately for variable interests in VIEs created after January 31, 2003. For a variable interest in a VIE created before February 1, 2003, the recognition provisions of FIN No. 46 shall apply (other than the required disclosures prior to the effective date) to that entity as of the interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company expects, as a result of the initial recognition provisions of FIN No. 46, to consolidate three VIEs effective July 1, 2003. These VIEs resulted from sale leaseback transactions entered into in previous years see Off balance Sheet Arrangements for further discussion on these transactions. The carrying value of the assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2002, attributed to these unconsolidated VIEs was approximately $519 million and $461 million, respectively. The Companys maximum exposure to loss, at December 31, 2002, as a result of its involvement in these VIEs is approximately $112 million. For further details regarding the above recent accounting pronouncements, see Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Accounting Matters In January 2001, the Company revised its vacation policy in the U.S. Starting January 1, 2001, employees earn vacation based on the calendar year rather than their anniversary date. Additionally, unused earned vacation may not be carried forward into the next calendar year. At December 31, 2000, the Companys vacation accrual for U.S. employees was approximately $22 million. As a result of the policy change, the balance was approximately $3 million at December 31, 2001 and represents vacation accrual for California and union employees where local law or contractual terms did not permit the adoption of the revised policy. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on the Companys current plans and expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements. Generally, the words believe, expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, will, may and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. Important factors that could cause such differences include, among others: general economic conditions in the U.S. and worldwide; the market for the Companys used equipment; the highly competitive environment applicable to the Companys operations (including competition in supply chain solutions from other logistics companies as well as from air cargo, shippers, railroads and motor carriers and competition in full service leasing and commercial rental from companies providing similar services as well as truck and trailer manufacturers that provide leasing, extended warranty maintenance, rental and other transportation services); greater than expected expenses associated with the Companys activities (including increased cost of fuel, freight and transportation) or personnel needs; availability of equipment; adverse changes in debt ratings; changes in accounting assumptions; changes in customers business environments (or the loss of a significant customer) or changes in government regulations. 38 The risks included here are not exhaustive. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors or to assess the impact of such risk factors on the Companys business. Accordingly, the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 39 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required by ITEM 7A is included in ITEM 7 (pages 33 through 34) of PART II of this report.
