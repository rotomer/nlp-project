ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8 of this report on Form 10 K. OVERVIEW Our business is divided into three business segments: our Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment provides leasing, commercial rental and programmed maintenance of commercial trucks, tractors and trailers to customers, principally in the U.S., Canada and the U.K.; our Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) business segment provides comprehensive supply chain consulting and lead logistics management solutions throughout North America and in Latin America, Europe and Asia; and our Dedicated Contract Carriage (DCC) business segment provides vehicles and drivers as part of a dedicated transportation solution, principally in North America. We operate in extremely competitive markets. Our customers select us based on numerous factors including service quality, price, technology and service offerings. As an alternative to using our services, customers may also choose to provide these services for themselves, or may choose to obtain similar or alternative services from other third party vendors. Over the past three years we have transformed our business, addressing many fundamental business processes throughout the organization. We have focused intently on addressing our cost structure and balance sheet in order to deliver improved results to our shareholders and also to make Ryder more competitive in the marketplace. In 2003, we continued to realize significant savings from our cost management initiatives and process improvement actions, allowing us to deliver strong results despite higher pension costs and reduced volumes in our U.S. contractual business. In the future, we will continue identifying cost saving opportunities to enhance our competitive position in a very competitive environment. During 2003, we targeted several strategic opportunities in our FMS business. In December, we completed the acquisition of a fleet of approximately 4,200 vehicles serving over 700 customers in the U.S. In December, we also announced that we had signed a non binding letter of intent to purchase another fleet of nearly 6,800 vehicles serving over 550 customers, which we expect to complete by the end of the first quarter of 2004. These acquisitions do not require us to build new capabilities and enable us to leverage our existing infrastructure to create operating synergies for our FMS business segment. In 2004, we will continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions in FMS and other segments of our business. In addition to our strategic initiatives, a primary issue that affects our business growth is economic conditions in the U.S. and in other regions of the world where we do business. Because of the soft U.S. economy over the past several years, our U.S. contractual business base was down in 2003. We are focused on increasing new sales while maintaining the appropriate pricing discipline that provides an attractive return for the service we provide to our customers. We are encouraged by recent increased levels of activity and interest on the part of our customers to sign new business. However, because of the time required to have lease equipment manufactured and delivered and to design and implement a new supply chain activity, there is a time lag in our businesses between the date when a contract is signed and when revenue is generated. Therefore, we do not expect to see an impact on revenue from new sales contracts until the middle of 2004. ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY BETWEEN PERIODS Effective July 1, 2003, Ryder consolidated three variable interest entities (VIEs) in connection with the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Interpretation No. (FIN) 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. The consolidated VIEs were established as part of previous sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment in which Ryder sold revenue earning equipment to special purpose entities (SPEs) and then leased the revenue earning equipment back as lessee under operating lease arrangements. Ryder enters into sale leaseback transactions in the ordinary course of business in order to lower the total cost of funding operations, to diversify funding among different classes of investors and to diversify funding among different types of funding instruments. Sale leaseback transactions have 17 Table of Contents been executed with third party financial institutions, as well as with SPEs. In connection with the sale leaseback transactions executed with SPEs, in the form of vehicle securitizations and a synthetic leasing arrangement, we provided credit enhancements and residual value guarantees that obligate Ryder to absorb the majority of the expected losses from such entities, if any are realized. Therefore, FIN 46 required that these entities be consolidated. As a result of the consolidation of these VIEs, Ryder recorded a non cash cumulative effect charge of $3 million on an after tax basis, or $0.05 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2003. The cumulative effect charge represented depreciation and interest expense of the VIEs that would have been recorded had FIN 46 been in effect since lease inception, in excess of rent expense recorded under operating leases. The charge is expected to reverse in operating earnings over the next three years. The consolidation of the VIEs did not have a significant impact on our consolidated net earnings; however, reported depreciation expense, equipment rental and interest expense were impacted by the consolidation of the VIEs. In addition, both net cash provided by operating activities and our free cash flow measure increased due to the add back of depreciation expense on the VIEs revenue earning equipment and net cash used in financing activities also increased due to principal payments on VIEs debt. Net earnings for 2002 and 2001 would not have been materially different if this standard had been adopted effective January 1, 2001. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made and that the associated asset retirement costs be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset. The cumulative effect adjustment recognized upon adoption of this standard was $1 million on an after tax basis, or $0.02 per diluted share, consisting primarily of costs associated with the retirement of certain components of revenue earning equipment. Net earnings for 2002 and 2001 would not have been materially different if this standard had been adopted effective January 1, 2001. Effective January 1, 2002, we also adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and discontinued the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Had we applied the non amortization provisions of SFAS No. 142 as of January 1, 2001, net earnings for 2001 would have totaled $30 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, as compared to the reported net earnings for 2001 of $19 million, or $0.31 per diluted share. SFAS No. 142 also required us to perform an assessment of whether there was an indication that the remaining recorded goodwill was impaired as of the date of adoption. The impairment test required us to compare the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill to our carrying amount, both of which were measured as of January 1, 2002. The residual fair value after this allocation was the implicit fair value of the reporting units goodwill. As a result of this assessment, we recorded a non cash cumulative effect charge of $19 million on a before and after tax basis, or $0.30 per diluted share, associated with the Asian operations of our SCS business segment. Under previous requirements, no goodwill impairment would have been recorded on January 1, 2002. 18 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Earnings before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles(1),(2) $ 135,559 112,565 18,678 Per diluted common share 2.12 1.80 0.31 Net earnings(1),(2),(3) 131,436 93,666 18,678 Per diluted common share 2.06 1.50 0.31 Weighted average shares outstanding diluted 63,871 62,587 60,665 (1) Results include restructuring and other charges of $2 million after tax, or $0.04 per diluted common share in 2002 and $81 million after tax, or $1.34 per diluted common share in 2001. See Note 4 Restructuring and Other (Recoveries) Charges, Net in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. (2) Results for 2001 include a one time reduction in deferred taxes of $7 million, or $0.11 per diluted common share, as a result of a change in Canadian tax law that affected our Canadian operations. Results for 2001 also include goodwill and intangible amortization of $12 million after tax, or $0.19 per diluted common share. (3) Net earnings for 2003 include the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for variable interest entities resulting in an after tax charge of $3 million, or $0.05 per diluted common share. Net earnings for 2003 also include the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for costs associated with eventual retirement of long lived assets primarily relating to components of revenue earning equipment resulting in an after tax charge of $1 million, or $0.02 per diluted common share. Net earnings for 2002 include the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for goodwill resulting in an after tax charge of $19 million, or $0.30 per diluted common share. Earnings before the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles increased 20% to $136 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase in earnings was due to savings realized from continuing cost management and process improving actions, improved SCS operating performance, better FMS rental pricing, and the impact of favorable exchange rate fluctuations. These earnings increases were partially offset by an increase in after tax annual pension expense of nearly $34 million which principally impacted our FMS business segment, which employs the majority of the employees that participate in our primary U.S. pension plan. The earnings growth rate in 2003 exceeded the related earnings per share growth rate because the average number of shares outstanding during 2003 increased reflecting the impact of stock issuances under employee stock option and stock purchase plans during the year. Earnings before the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles increased 503% to $113 million in 2002 compared with 2001. The increase in earnings was due primarily to a significant reduction in restructuring and other charges from $81 million after tax in 2001 compared with $2 million after tax in 2002. The increase in earnings was also attributable to cost management actions and operational process improvement efforts, improved rental utilization, increased volumes within the automotive sector of SCS, lower interest costs and the discontinuance of amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). These earnings increases were partially offset by a one time reduction in deferred taxes of $7 million in 2001 as a result of a change in Canadian tax law and higher pension costs of $19 million after tax in 2002, compared with 2001. See Operating Results by Business Segment for further discussion of the operating results for the past three years. Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Revenue: Fleet Management Solutions $ 3,231,675 3,183,022 3,352,540 Supply Chain Solutions 1,362,428 1,388,299 1,453,881 Dedicated Contract Carriage 514,731 517,961 534,962 Eliminations (306,540 ) (313,017 ) (335,260 ) Total $ 4,802,294 4,776,265 5,006,123 Revenue for 2003 increased 1% to $4.8 billion compared with 2002. Comparisons were impacted by increased FMS fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. For all years reported, Ryder realized minimal changes in profitability as a result of higher fuel prices as these generally reflect costs that are passed through to our customers. During 2003, FMS was negatively impacted by continued softness in the U.S. economy resulting in reduced full service lease and programmed maintenance demand, as well as the impact of some ancillary business not renewed. These decreases were partially offset by improved commercial rental revenue due to higher pricing. SCS revenue decreased in 2003 compared with 2002 as a result of volume reductions combined with the non renewal of certain customer contracts. Revenue comparisons for FMS and SCS were favorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and expanded business in Canada, Latin America and Asia. 19 Table of Contents Revenue decreased 5% to $4.8 billion in 2002 compared with 2001. All business segments experienced a revenue decrease in 2002 over 2001 as a result of the slow economic conditions in the U.S. and in other countries where we operate. The FMS revenue decrease of 5% also reflects the effects of a smaller overall fleet (primarily in commercial rental) and lower fuel services revenue as a result of lower average fuel prices and volumes. SCS revenue decreased in 2002 as a result of volume reductions, especially in the electronics, high tech and telecommunications sector and the non renewal of certain customer contracts. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at approximate fair value as if the sales were made to third parties. Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Operating expense $ 2,039,156 1,949,384 2,132,500 Percentage of revenue 42 % 41 % 43 % Operating expense increased 5% to $2.0 billion in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase was principally a result of increases in fuel costs due to higher average fuel prices in 2003. Operating expense was also impacted by higher maintenance costs as a result of an older fleet, offset by a reduction in overhead spending from ongoing cost management actions. Operating expense decreased 9% to $1.9 billion in 2002 compared with 2001. The decrease was a result of a reduction in FMS fuel costs as a result of lower average prices and volumes in 2002, a reduction in overheads due to cost containment actions, including the shut down of certain facilities in 2001, and the cancellation of an information technology outsourcing contract. Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $ 1,242,930 1,268,704 1,212,184 Percentage of revenue 26 % 27 % 24 % Salaries and employee related costs decreased 2% to $1.2 billion in 2003 compared with 2002. The decrease was a result of headcount reductions, which offset higher pension expense. Average headcount decreased 6% in 2003 compared with 2002 reflecting the non renewal of certain customer contracts, the impact of cost management actions and reduced volumes across all business segments. The number of employees at December 31, 2003 decreased 4% to approximately 26,700, compared with 27,800 at December 31, 2002. Pension expense increased nearly $54 million in 2003 to $82 million compared with 2002, and principally impacted FMS. The increase in pension expense is primarily attributable to the U.S. pension plan and reflects the adverse effect of negative pension asset returns in 2002, as well as the impact of lower interest rates resulting in a lower discount rate for calculating the present value of pension obligations. Based on actual pension asset returns experienced in 2003 and interest rate levels at December 31, 2003, we expect pension expense on a pre tax basis to decrease to approximately $66 million in 2004. Our 2004 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of actuarial analysis of all pension plans. See Critical Accounting Estimates for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. The anticipated pension expense decrease in 2004 would primarily impact FMS, which employs the majority of employees that participate in Ryders primary U.S. pension plan. Salaries and employee related costs increased 5% to $1.3 billion in 2002 compared with 2001. The increase was due to growth in pension and medical benefit costs, higher salary expense from the in sourcing of certain information technology functions and greater incentive compensation, which was partially offset by decreased salaries and other employee related costs as a result of 2001 strategic initiatives that resulted in the termination of over 1,400 employees. See Restructuring and Other (Recoveries) Charges, Net for further discussion. 20 Table of Contents Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Freight under management expense $ 414,284 414,369 436,413 Percentage of revenue 9 % 9 % 9 % Freight under management (FUM) expense represents subcontracted freight costs on logistics contracts for which Ryder purchases transportation. FUM expense of $414 million in 2003 was unchanged compared with 2002. The volume decline experienced in our SCS business during 2003 was principally attributed to non transportation based activities. FUM expense decreased 5% in 2002 compared with 2001 due to revenue reductions in our SCS business segment as a result of reduced freight volumes in the U.S. and South America and the non renewal of customer contracts. Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Depreciation expense $ 624,580 552,491 545,485 Gains on vehicle sales, net (15,780 ) (14,223 ) (11,968 ) Equipment rental 200,868 343,531 427,024 Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense in 2003 increased 13% to $625 million compared with 2002. While the overall average fleet size (owned and leased) declined 3% during 2003, depreciation expense grew because of an increase in the average number of owned (compared with leased) revenue earning equipment units. The number of owned units increased because of the consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003, the conversion of leased units to owned status as a result of lease extensions and the replacement of expiring lease units with owned. See discussion on Fleet Management Solutions in Operating Results by Business Segment for further detail on vehicle counts. For the six months ended December 31, 2003, depreciation expense attributable to the revenue earning equipment of consolidated VIEs approximated $40 million. Depreciation expense increased 1% to $552 million in 2002 compared with 2001. Depreciation expense increased due to a greater number of owned (compared with leased) revenue earning equipment units as well as reduced estimated residual values associated with certain owned tractors. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased 11% to $16 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase in gains on vehicle sales, net was due to a higher number of FMS unit sales of owned equipment and improved average pricing on vehicles sold in the tractor class compared with 2002. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased 19% to $14 million in 2002 compared with 2001. Despite a reduction in the number of vehicles sold, Ryder experienced an increase in gains on vehicle sales, net due to a decline in the average book value of units sold. The decline in the average book value of units sold in 2002 reflected an increase in depreciation expense and an increase in the age of vehicles sold. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See Critical Accounting Estimates for further discussion on depreciation and residual value guarantees. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in higher depreciation or losses on disposal. Equipment rental primarily consists of rental costs on revenue earning equipment in FMS. Equipment rental costs decreased 42% to $201 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The decrease was due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles (compared with owned) resulting from the consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003, term extensions and an overall decline in fleet size, which principally impacted equipment under lease. 21 Table of Contents For the six months ended December 31, 2003, equipment rental was reduced by approximately $50 million for revenue earning equipment of VIEs consolidated effective July 1, 2003. Equipment rental costs decreased 20% to $344 million in 2002 compared with 2001. The decrease in 2002 equipment rental is due to a decrease in the number of leased vehicles and lower lease rates due to a changing mix of leased units. Equipment rental costs in 2002 also reflect decreased lease termination charges as a result of improved market pricing. Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Interest expense $ 96,169 91,718 118,549 Percentage of revenue 2 % 2 % 2 % Interest expense increased 5% to $96 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase in interest expense reflects the impact of interest expense of approximately $10 million on debt of VIEs, consolidated effective July 1, 2003. Excluding interest expense from consolidated VIEs, comparisons for 2003 were favorably impacted by overall lower market interest rates and reduced effective interest rates as a result of hedging transactions which principally benefited FMS. Interest expense decreased 23% to $92 million in 2002 compared with 2001. The decrease in interest expense reflects lower debt levels due to reduced capital spending, generally lower market interest rates and reduced effective interest rates as a result of hedging transactions entered into during the first quarter of 2002. Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Miscellaneous income, net $ (12,158 ) (9,808 ) (1,334 ) Miscellaneous income, net increased to $12 million in 2003 from $10 million in 2002. During 2003, miscellaneous income, net was favorably impacted from a $2 million gain on sale of a facility in our European FMS operations. Additionally, 2003 miscellaneous income, net improved as a result of better market performance of investments classified as trading securities used to fund certain benefit plans and lower losses on the sale of trade receivables related to the decreased use of our revolving receivables financing program. These positive factors were partially offset by the elimination of servicing fee income related to certain VIEs. Prior to the consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003, miscellaneous income, net included fee income related to administrative services provided to vehicle lease trusts in connection with the vehicle securitization transactions. As a result of consolidating the vehicle securitization trusts, we no longer recognize a benefit from service fee income. Ryder had miscellaneous income, net of $10 million in 2002 compared with miscellaneous income, net of $1 million in 2001. The increase in miscellaneous income, net during 2002 is primarily attributed to a reduction in losses on the sale of receivables related to the decreased use of Ryders revolving facility for the sale of receivables and 2001 losses on the sale of operating property and equipment. Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Restructuring and other (recoveries) charges, net $ (230 ) 4,216 116,564 Restructuring and other (recoveries) charges, net were $(0.2) million in 2003, $4 million in 2002 and $117 million in 2001. See Restructuring and Other (Recoveries) Charges, Net for further discussion. Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Provision for income taxes $ 76,916 63,318 12,028 Ryders effective tax rate was 36.2% in 2003 compared with 36.0% in 2002 and 39.2% in 2001. The higher 2001 effective tax rate resulted primarily from increased net non deductible items in 2001, principally the write down of goodwill, included in restructuring and other (recoveries) charges, partially offset by a permanent reduction in corporate tax rates in Canada. This resulted in a one time reduction in Ryders related deferred taxes of approximately $7 million. 22 Table of Contents RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER (RECOVERIES) CHARGES, NET The components of restructuring and other (recoveries) charges, net in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were as follows: Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Restructuring charges (recoveries), net: Severance and employee related costs $ 4,902 5,198 30,438 Facilities and related costs (8 ) 106 6,261 4,894 5,304 36,699 Other (recoveries) charges: Asset write downs (1,182 ) (285 ) 40,046 Goodwill impairment 24,425 Strategic consulting fees (64 ) 8,586 Loss on sale of business 3,512 Contract termination costs (219 ) 8,345 Insurance reserves sold business (42 ) (520 ) (2,920 ) Gain on sale of corporate aircraft (2,129 ) Settlement of commercial dispute (3,900 ) Total $ (230 ) 4,216 116,564 Allocation of restructuring and other (recoveries) charges, net across business segments in 2003, 2002 and 2001 is as follows: Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Fleet Management Solutions $ (961 ) (177 ) 48,930 Supply Chain Solutions 536 5,137 61,246 Dedicated Contract Carriage (311 ) 243 1,370 Central Support Services 506 (987 ) 5,018 Total $ (230 ) 4,216 116,564 2003 Activity During 2003, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 140 positions as a result of on going cost management and process improvement actions in Ryders FMS and SCS business segments and Central Support Services. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $6 million. While many of these employees had not been terminated as of December 31, 2003, such actions will be finalized by March 31, 2004. We expect pre tax cost savings of approximately $11 million annually in salaries and employee related costs as a result of these cost management activities. Also during 2003, we reversed severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million that had been recorded in prior restructurings due to refinements in estimates. 23 Table of Contents Other recoveries during 2003 principally include a settlement of a commercial dispute pertaining to prior billings with an information technology vendor and gains on sales of owned facilities identified for closure in prior restructuring charges. 2002 Activity During the fourth quarter of 2002, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 140 positions as a result of cost management actions principally in our SCS business segment and Central Support Services, which were substantially finalized as of December 31, 2002. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $7 million. Our estimate of pre tax cost savings in salaries and employee related costs as a result of these cost management activities totaled approximately $14 million. During 2002, we reversed severance and employee related costs totaling $2 million that had been recorded in prior restructuring charges due to refinements in the estimates. Other recoveries during 2002 include net gains (recoveries) on sale of owned facilities identified for closure in prior restructuring charges, the reversal of contract termination costs recognized in 2001 resulting from refinements in estimates and the final settlement of insurance reserves attributed to a previously sold business. 2001 Activity In late 2000, we communicated to our employees planned strategic initiatives designed to reduce costs, improve the earnings power of our business and streamline our structure. As part of these initiatives, we reviewed employee functions and staffing levels to eliminate redundant work or otherwise restructure work in a manner that led to a workforce reduction. The process resulted in terminations of over 1,400 employees during 2001, which were substantially finalized as of December 31, 2002. Severance and employee related costs of $30 million, net of $2 million in recoveries of prior year charges, in 2001 included termination benefits to employees whose jobs were eliminated as part of this review. During the third quarter of 2001, we initiated the shutdown of Systemcare, Ryders shared user home delivery network in the U.K. The shutdown was initiated as a result of our review of future prospects for the operation in light of historical and anticipated operating losses. The shutdown was completed after meeting contractual obligations to current customers, which extended to December 31, 2002. The severance and employee related charge included $3 million incurred as part of the Systemcare shutdown. During 2001, we identified 55 facilities in the U.S. and in other countries to be closed in order to improve profitability. Facilities and related costs of $6 million in 2001 represent contractual lease obligations for closed facilities. Additionally, during 2001 we recorded various other charges which are summarized as follows: Asset write downs: Asset write downs of $40 million were recorded during 2001 and are described below: In 2001, Ryder cancelled an information technology project in the FMS business segment. In connection with the cancellation, we recorded a non cash charge of $22 million for the write down of software licenses acquired for the project that could not be resold or redeployed and software development costs and assets related to the project that had no future economic benefit. In 1997, Ryder entered into an Information Technology Services Agreement (ITSA) with Accenture LLP (Accenture) under which we outsourced many of our information technology needs that were previously provided by Ryder employees. Under the terms of the ITSA, Ryder prepaid for a number of services to be provided over the 10 year term of the agreement expiring in 2007. Under the terms of the agreement, Ryder was also obligated to pay certain termination costs to Accenture in the event the ITSA was terminated by Ryder prior to the expiration date. As part of restructuring initiatives in 2001, we approved and committed Ryder to in source services provided by Accenture under the ITSA. In December 2001, Ryder and Accenture entered into a written agreement to transition certain IT services previously delivered by Accenture under contract to Ryder. Under this agreement, Ryder agreed to waive any right to reimbursement of approximately $3 million in unamortized prepaid expenses related to the ITSA. 24 Table of Contents Strategic initiatives during 2001 also resulted in asset write downs to fair value less cost to sell of approximately $4 million for facilities that were identified for closure and held for sale pursuant to the initiatives. At such time, Ryder had the ability to remove the facilities from operations upon identification of a buyer or receipt of an acceptable bid. Fair value was determined based on appraisals of these properties. Also, as part of the strategic initiatives, we wrote down investments in e commerce assets of $3 million, including specialized property and equipment and software, that were terminated or abandoned during 2001 and for which the fair value of such investments was zero. Additionally, during 2001, an investment of $6 million in certain license agreements for supply chain management software was written down. The write down consisted of the unamortized cost of licenses and related software development costs previously capitalized for which development was abandoned as a result of restructuring initiatives. Since the software licenses would no longer be used in the business nor could the licenses be resold, such licenses were valued at zero. Due to the decision to shut down the aforementioned Systemcare operations, we assessed the recoverability of Systemcares long lived assets held for use as described in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Impairment of Long Lived Assets in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Assets of $2 million, consisting primarily of specialized vehicles to be disposed of after the shutdown of Systemcares operations, were considered impaired and written down because estimated fair values were less than the carrying values of the assets. Fair values were determined based on internal valuations of similar assets. Goodwill Impairment: We also identified certain operating units for which circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of long lived assets, in particular, goodwill, may not be recoverable. We assessed the recoverability of these long lived assets and determined that the goodwill related to these operating units was not recoverable. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for Ryders policy on impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. Impairment charges in 2001, all of which related to SCS operating units, are summarized as follows: (In thousands) Systemcare U.K. home delivery network $ 10,602 Ryder Argentina 9,130 Ryder Brazil 3,706 Other 987 Total $ 24,425 As part of the decision to shut down the aforementioned Systemcare operations, goodwill of $11 million was considered impaired and written down during 2001. Goodwill impairment in Ryder Argentina was triggered by the significant adverse change in the business climate in Argentina in the fourth quarter of 2001 that led to a devaluation of the Argentine Peso, breakdowns in the Argentine banking system and repeated turnover in the countrys leadership. These factors, combined with a history of operating losses and anticipated future operating losses, led to goodwill impairment. Goodwill of $9 million was considered impaired and was written down in December 2001. During the fourth quarter of 2001, we reviewed goodwill associated with our remaining investment in Ryder Brazil for impairment. Subsequent to the sale of the contracts and related net assets associated with the disposal of our outbound auto carriage business (Vehiculos) in Ryder Brazil discussed below, we made a significant effort to restructure the operations of Ryder Brazil. However, such restructuring was not sufficient to offset the impact of lost business, the impact of the Argentine economic crisis and the marginal historical and anticipated cash flows related to the remaining business. As a result of this analysis, goodwill of $4 million was considered impaired and was written down in December 2001. 25 Table of Contents Strategic consulting fees: Strategic consulting fees of $9 million were incurred during 2001 in relation to the aforementioned strategic initiatives. These consulting fees represented one time costs of engaging consultants to assist with restructuring initiatives in 2001. Loss on sale of business: During March 2001, Ryder sold Vehiculos in Ryder Brazil for $14 million and incurred a loss of $4 million on the sale of the business. Contract termination costs: In connection with the agreement to in source information technology services provided by Accenture, Ryder agreed to pay termination fees and certain demobilization costs of approximately $8 million. Also during 2001, we made a decision to terminate a long term marketing arrangement to reduce marketing costs. Insurance reserves sold business: During 2001, we recognized $3 million in recoveries from an insurance settlement attributed to a business sold in 1989. The insurance recovery represents an adjustment to our indemnification reserve for favorable actuarial developments since the time of the sale. Gain on sale of corporate aircraft: As a direct result of the 2001 restructuring and cost reduction initiatives, we decided to sell our corporate aircraft. Ryder sold the aircraft during the first quarter of 2001 and recorded a $2 million gain on the sale. OPERATING RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Revenue: Fleet Management Solutions $ 3,231,675 3,183,022 3,352,540 Supply Chain Solutions 1,362,428 1,388,299 1,453,881 Dedicated Contract Carriage 514,731 517,961 534,962 Eliminations (306,540 ) (313,017 ) (335,260 ) Total $ 4,802,294 4,776,265 5,006,123 NBT: Fleet Management Solutions $ 195,493 214,384 194,398 Supply Chain Solutions 41,254 (6,221 ) (6,760 ) Dedicated Contract Carriage 33,516 31,157 34,755 Eliminations (33,586 ) (34,636 ) (36,989 ) 236,677 204,684 185,404 Unallocated Central Support Services (24,432 ) (24,585 ) (25,396 ) Goodwill Amortization (12,738 ) Restructuring and other recoveries (charges), net 230 (4,216 ) (116,564 ) Earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles $ 212,475 175,883 30,706 We define the primary measurement of our segment financial performance as Net Before Tax (NBT) which includes an allocation of Central Support Services (CSS) and excludes goodwill impairment, goodwill amortization and restructuring and other recoveries (charges), net. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all of our business segments, including sales and marketing, human resources, finance, corporate services, information technology, health and safety, legal and communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each of our business segments and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. 26 Table of Contents Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, corporate communications, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 22 Segment Reporting in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenues and NBT are accounted for at approximate fair value as if the transactions were made with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) is included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 15,319 15,454 16,619 Dedicated Contract Carriage 18,267 19,182 20,370 Total $ 33,586 34,636 36,989 These segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Fleet Management Solutions Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Full service lease and programmed maintenance $ 1,791,478 1,795,254 1,855,865 Commercial rental 490,864 458,355 468,438 Other 308,606 346,770 369,912 Dry revenue(1) 2,590,948 2,600,379 2,694,215 Fuel services revenue 640,727 582,643 658,325 Total revenue $ 3,231,675 3,183,022 3,352,540 Segment NBT $ 195,493 214,384 194,398 Segment NBT as a % of total revenue 6.0 % 6.7 % 5.8 % Segment NBT as a % of dry revenue(1) 7.5 % 8.2 % 7.2 % (1) We use dry revenue, a non GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of our FMS business segment and as a measure of sales activity. Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our dry revenue computation, as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in fuel services revenue. 27 Table of Contents 2003 versus 2002 FMS total revenue increased 2% to $3.2 billion in 2003 compared with 2002. Revenue in 2003 was impacted by increases in fuel services revenue as a result of increased average fuel prices, particularly during the first half of 2003. Dry revenue (revenue excluding fuel) totaling $2.6 billion remained unchanged in 2003 compared with 2002. In 2003, FMS total revenue and dry revenue benefited from favorable exchange rates in Canada and the U.K. Full service lease and programmed maintenance revenue remained unchanged in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to the effects of weak leasing demand in the U.S., a reduction in fleet size and fewer total miles run by leased vehicles, which resulted in decreased variable billings. The impact of these negative factors was partially offset by higher revenue in Canada and the U.K. as a result of favorable exchange rates and higher volumes. We expect full service lease and programmed maintenance revenue to improve in 2004 due to new initiatives aimed at generating new sales and improving business retention, expected continued improvement of the U.S. economy and the impact from an acquisition completed at the end of 2003. As previously announced, we are also in the process of negotiating the acquisition of a fleet of approximately 6,800 vehicles (lease and commercial rental) which is expected to be closed by the end of the first quarter of 2004. Commercial rental revenue (consisting of pure rental and lease customer revenue) increased 7% to $491 million in 2003 compared with 2002. Commercial rental revenue comparisons have steadily improved since the end of 2002 and, in fourth quarter of 2003, revenue grew 9% compared with the year earlier period. Commercial rental revenue increased primarily as a result of stronger pricing throughout 2003. U.S. rental fleet utilization was 72% and remained unchanged in 2003 as compared with 2002. In the U.S., pure rental revenue (total rental revenue less rental revenue related to units provided to full service lease customers), which accounts for over half of the U.S. commercial rental business, increased 8% to $235 million as compared with $219 million in 2002 due to stronger pricing. Lease customer revenue primarily represents rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. In the U.S., lease customer revenue increased 2% to $175 million in 2003 compared with the prior year reflecting the impact of increased rental activity from full service lease customers. Rental statistics presented are for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue. We expect commercial rental revenue to continue to improve in 2004 based on the modest increases in rental transactions experienced during the second half of 2003, improved pricing discipline and the impact of acquisitions. Other FMS revenue, which consists of trailer rentals, other maintenance and repairs services and ancillary revenue to support product lines, decreased 11% to $309 million in 2003 compared with 2002. Other revenue decreased due primarily to the non renewal of a customer contract to provide ancillary fleet services which expired at the end of the first quarter of 2003. We expect unfavorable comparisons in other revenue to continue through the end of the first quarter of 2004 with prospects of modest improvement for the balance of the year. FMS NBT decreased 9% to $195 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The decrease was due primarily to higher pension expense of $48 million in 2003 as compared with 2002. NBT comparisons were also adversely impacted by lower lease revenue and the non renewal of a contract to provide ancillary fleet services. The impact of these items was partially offset by higher commercial rental pricing, improved asset management performance resulting from lower vehicle counts and carrying costs, reduced operating expenses as a result of our cost management and process improvement actions and the impact of favorable exchange rate fluctuations. 2002 versus 2001 FMS total revenue decreased 5% to $3.2 billion in 2002 compared with 2001. Revenue comparisons in 2002 were impacted by decreases in fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue declined 11% to $583 million in 2002 compared with 2001, as a result of lower volume and pricing, particularly during the first half of 2002. Dry revenue (revenue excluding fuel) decreased 3% to $2.6 billion in 2002 compared with 2001 reflecting revenue declines in leasing and commercial rental revenue. 28 Table of Contents Full service lease and programmed maintenance revenue decreased 3% to $1.8 billion in 2002 compared with 2001. The decrease was primarily due to the weak U.S. economy as well as decreases in variable billings, which are generally a function of total miles run by leased vehicles. All elements of our commercial rental revenue decreased in 2002 compared with 2001 reflecting slow economic conditions and a planned rental fleet reduction, which offset improved rental utilization and pricing. U.S. rental fleet utilization improved to 72% in 2002 compared with 69% in 2001. Our U.S. commercial rental fleet size declined 8% in 2002 as compared with 2001. In the U.S., pure rental revenue decreased 2% to $219 million in 2002 compared with 2001 due to the continued softness in the U.S. economy. In the U.S., lease customer revenue decreased 5% to $172 million in 2002 compared with the prior year. Other transportation services revenue decreased 6% in 2002 compared with 2001 as a result of the weak U.S. economy. FMS NBT increased 10% to $214 million in 2002 compared with 2001. The increase was due primarily to improved rental utilization, lower interest expense and operating expense reductions due to cost management and process improvement initiatives. NBT for 2002 also benefited from lower carrying costs on used vehicles held for sale (owned and leased) because of reduced vehicle counts and, to a lesser extent, improved pricing on tractor sales. Such improvements were partially offset by increased pension expense of $23 million in 2002 over 2001. Our fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): December 31 Number of Units 2003 2002 By type: Trucks 62,400 62,200 Tractors 48,900 48,800 Trailers 43,200 44,800 Other 5,700 5,600 Total 160,200 161,400 By business: Full service lease 118,900 120,900 Commercial rental 38,500 37,600 Service and other vehicles 2,800 2,900 Total 160,200 161,400 Owned(1),(2) 150,200 125,500 Leased(1) 10,000 35,900 Total 160,200 161,400 Full year average(1),(2) 160,000 165,200 (1) Effective July 1, 2003, 15,800 units converted from leased to owned status in connection with the consolidation of VIEs. (2) Effective December 31, 2003, 4,200 units were added to the fleet as part of an acquisition. 29 Table of Contents The totals in each of the tables above include the following non revenue earning equipment (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): December 31 Number of Units 2003 2002 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 1,000 1,100 No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale 4,300 3,500 Other NLE units 2,800 3,500 Total(1) 8,100 8,100 (1) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,000 vehicles for all periods presented, which are not included above. NYE units represent new units on hand that are being prepared for deployment to lease customers or into our rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration units. NLE units represent units held for sale, as well as other units for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. These vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or not rented due to lack of demand. Supply Chain Solutions Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) U.S. operating revenue: Automotive, aerospace and industrial $ 420,066 439,788 422,380 High tech and consumer industries 247,475 295,428 335,749 Other 14,665 14,350 15,459 U.S. operating revenue 682,206 749,566 773,588 International operating revenue 270,316 228,206 248,762 Total operating revenue(1) 952,522 977,772 1,022,350 Freight under management (FUM) expense 409,906 410,527 431,531 Total revenue $ 1,362,428 1,388,299 1,453,881 Segment NBT $ 41,254 (6,221 ) (6,760 ) Segment NBT as a % of total revenue 3.0 % (0.4% ) (0.5% ) Segment NBT as a % of operating revenue(1) 4.3 % (0.6% ) (0.7% ) (1) We use operating revenue, a non GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of our SCS business segment and as a measure of sales activity. FUM expense is deducted from total revenue to arrive at our operating revenue computation as FUM expense is largely a pass through to customers. Ryder realizes minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in FUM expense. 2003 versus 2002 SCS total revenue in 2003 of $1.4 billion decreased 2% as compared with 2002. Operating revenue (which excludes FUM) decreased 3% in 2003 compared with 2002. U.S. operating revenue declined 9% in 2003 compared to 2002 as a result of reduced volume levels in some of our customer segments and the non renewal of certain contracts. The revenue reductions in the U.S. were partially offset by increased volumes 30 Table of Contents and expanded business in Canada, Latin America and Asia, as well as the favorable impact of exchange rates. International revenue comparisons were also favorably impacted by revenue from an inventory procurement contract which generated $21 million in revenue in 2003. In the first quarter of 2004, the terms of this contract were favorably renegotiated to eliminate inventory risk and will require net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. We expect unfavorable revenue comparisons to continue in light of the non renewal of certain customer contracts, competitive market conditions and volume reductions in some industry sectors. The SCS business segment NBT improved to $41 million in 2003 compared with a deficit of $6 million in 2002. Despite lower operating revenue in 2003, SCS improved results were driven by numerous profit improvement actions taken in this business over the past eighteen months, which have reduced overhead costs and improved global operating performance. SCS NBT in 2002 was negatively impacted by facility lease termination charges of $3 million and also costs associated with profit margin improvement initiatives. 2002 versus 2001 SCS total revenue in 2002 decreased 5% to $1.4 billion compared with 2001. Operating revenue decreased 4% in 2002 compared with 2001. The declines in revenue for 2002 reflect volume reductions in the electronics, high tech and telecommunications and consumer products operating units as a result of the slowdown in the U.S. economy in general and those sectors specifically. The revenue decline was also impacted by the non renewal of certain customer contracts and the currency devaluation and economic downturn in Argentina. These revenue decreases were partially offset by new and expanded business in the automotive sector in our U.S. and European operations. SCS NBT improved 8% to a deficit of $6 million in 2002 from a deficit of $7 million in 2001. SCS NBT was negatively impacted by facility lease termination charges of $3 million recorded in 2002, reduced revenue and higher overhead spending. The increased overhead spending was due to increased costs associated with profit improvement initiatives and higher employee benefit costs. These decreases were partially offset by new and expanded profitable business in the automotive and electronics, high tech and telecommunications operating units, improvement in SCS European operations and continued benefits from margin improvement initiatives, including the elimination of certain unprofitable business and the implementation of cost containment controls. Dedicated Contract Carriage Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Operating revenue(1) $ 510,353 514,119 530,080 Freight under management (FUM) expense 4,378 3,842 4,882 Total revenue $ 514,731 517,961 534,962 Segment NBT $ 33,516 31,157 34,755 Segment NBT as a % of total revenue 6.5 % 6.0 % 6.5 % Segment NBT as a % of operating revenue(1) 6.6 % 6.1 % 6.6 % (1) We use operating revenue, a non GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of our DCC business segment and as a measure of sales activity. FUM expense is deducted from total revenue to arrive at our operating revenue computation as FUM expense is largely a pass through to customers. Ryder realizes minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in FUM expense. 31 Table of Contents 2003 versus 2002 DCC total revenue in 2003 decreased 1% to $515 million compared with 2002. DCC operating revenue in 2003 decreased 1% to $510 million compared with 2002. Reduced volumes associated with customer contracts not renewed were partially offset by higher average fuel prices in 2003. NBT increased 8% to $34 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase in NBT for 2003 reflects decreased overhead spending and improved operating performance. These improvements were partially offset by the impact of customer contracts not renewed. Lower salaries and employee related costs, sales and marketing costs and insurance costs contributed to the lower overhead spending. 2002 versus 2001 DCC total revenue in 2002 decreased 3% to $518 million compared with 2001. DCC operating revenue in 2002 decreased 3% to $514 million compared with 2001. The decrease in revenue was due primarily to the non renewal of unprofitable business partially offset by new business in 2002. NBT decreased 10% to $31 million in 2002 compared with 2001. The decrease in NBT for 2002 reflects increased overhead spending partially offset by the non renewal of unprofitable business and margin improvements in other operational areas. Central Support Services CSS expenses were as follows: Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Sales and marketing $ 8,964 12,636 15,045 Human resources 18,000 21,151 21,911 Finance 55,180 58,498 55,411 Corporate services/public affairs 7,314 7,672 8,023 Information technology 78,084 89,092 111,240 Health and safety 8,199 9,192 9,046 Other 37,275 35,191 24,548 Total CSS 213,016 233,432 245,224 Allocation of CSS to business segments (188,584 ) (208,847 ) (219,828 ) Unallocated CSS $ 24,432 24,585 25,396 2003 versus 2002 CSS decreased 9% to $213 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The decrease in total CSS expense was due to cost reductions across substantially all functional areas as a result of our continued cost management and process improvement actions, most notably in information technology (IT). Technology costs were lower in 2003 as a result of reduced pricing on purchased IT services and the impact of in sourcing certain IT services during the first quarter of 2002. We have achieved reductions in CSS costs year over year for twelve consecutive quarters as a result of our continued focus on cost management controls. This focus not only improves Ryders profitability but also helps improve our competitiveness in the market place. We expect continued reductions in CSS spending levels to continue over the near term. 2002 versus 2001 CSS decreased 5% to $233 million in 2002 compared with 2001. The decrease in total CSS expense was due primarily to reductions in several elements of CSS expense as a result of our continued cost management actions. Most notably, technology costs were reduced in 2002 resulting from the in sourcing of certain IT services combined with decreased development and support costs as a result of the cancellation of an FMS IT project in 2001. These cost reductions were partially offset by higher incentive compensation due to improved overall performance. 32 Table of Contents FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 802,855 632,787 308,702 Financing activities (232,796 ) (269,508 ) (319,699 ) Investing activities (533,669 ) (376,908 ) 6,893 Net cash flows from operations $ 36,390 (13,629 ) (4,104 ) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $803 million in 2003 compared with 2002 due to changes in the aggregate balance of trade receivables sold, improved operating performance and reduced working capital needs. This increase was partially offset by cash contributions totaling $68 million to our defined benefit pension plans. The reduced working capital needs related primarily to an increase in accounts payable and lower cash payments for accrued expenses (equipment rental obligations). As a result of adopting FIN 46 effective July 1, 2003, 15,800 vehicles were converted from leased to owned status and produced approximately $40 million of depreciation expense add backs to cash provided by operating activities. The increase in cash from operating activities to $633 million in 2002 compared with 2001 was attributable to a reduction in overall working capital needs, changes in the aggregate balance of trade receivables sold and improved operating performance. The lower working capital needs in 2002 related primarily to lower levels of business activity as reflected in decreased revenue compared with 2001. During 2003, cash of $233 million was used in financing activities, primarily to reduce debt. Cash used in financing activities decreased in 2003 compared to 2002 due to lower debt payments and increased proceeds from stock option exercises. Debt levels in 2003 compared with 2002 were also impacted by the conversion of off balance sheet obligations to debt attributed to VIEs consolidated effective July 1, 2003. Principal payments on consolidated VIE debt totaled $119 million in 2003. The decrease in cash used in financing activities to $270 million in 2002 compared with the prior year reflects increased proceeds from stock option exercises and lower debt repayments. Cash used in investing activities grew to $534 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase in cash used in investing activities was due to higher capital spending, primarily to refresh our commercial rental fleet. Additionally, 2003 investing activities reflect payments of $97 million associated with two FMS acquisitions closed during the year. The increase in cash used in investing activities to $377 million in 2002 as compared with 2001 reflects proceeds of $411 million from a vehicle securitization in 2001 partially offset with a reduction of capital expenditures in 2002. We manage our business to maximize operating cash flows and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities (excluding changes in the aggregate balance of trade receivables sold), collections on direct finance leases, proceeds from sale of assets, capital expenditures and acquisitions as free cash flow. Although free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure, we consider it to be an important measure of comparative operating performance. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. 33 Table of Contents The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 802,855 632,787 308,702 Changes in the aggregate balance of trade receivables sold 110,000 235,000 Collections on direct finance leases 61,368 66,489 66,204 Sales of property and revenue earning equipment 222,888 152,685 175,134 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (725,130 ) (600,301 ) (656,597 ) Acquisitions (96,518 ) Other, net 3,723 4,219 (2,700 ) Free cash flow $ 269,186 365,879 125,743 The decrease in free cash flow to $269 million in 2003 compared with 2002 was due to higher capital spending levels which was partially offset by higher sales proceeds. The increase in capital spending levels and sales proceeds reflects the impact of higher vehicle replacements to refresh an aging FMS commercial rental fleet and payments associated with two FMS acquisitions completed during the year. The increase in free cash flow to $366 million in 2002 compared with 2001 was primarily attributable to a reduction in overall working capital needs and improved operating performance. The decrease in working capital was attributable in part to lower levels of business activity in 2002 as compared with 2001. We expect free cash flow levels to decline in 2004 as a result of the increased capital spending requirements discussed below. Our FMS operations are capital intensive, characterized by significant investments primarily in vehicles (revenue earning equipment). Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 459,239 536,151 448,760 Commercial rental 219,880 20,177 130,560 679,119 556,328 579,320 Operating property and equipment 46,011 43,973 77,277 Total $ 725,130 600,301 656,597 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of $67 million for both 2003 and 2002 in assets held under capital leases, resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. The increase in capital expenditures to $725 million in 2003 compared with 2002 was due to planned higher levels of vehicle replacements, primarily for the commercial rental fleet. The decrease in capital expenditures to $600 million in 2002 compared with 2001 was due primarily to reduced U.S. leasing demand, improved controls over capital expenditures and a reduction in the volume of early replacements of full service leases. Capital expenditure levels have been relatively low each of the last three years as we have focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. As a result of our fleet age and anticipated higher levels of new sales activity, total capital expenditures are anticipated to increase to approximately $1.2 billion in 2004, including vehicle replacements of approximately $900 million and vehicle spending for anticipated incremental growth of approximately $155 million. We expect to fund 2004 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. 34 Table of Contents During 2003, Ryder completed two acquisitions related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $97 million in 2003. Approximately $11 million is due to the sellers at December 31, 2003 and will be paid, subject to holdback provisions, in 2004 and 2005. No acquisitions were completed in 2002 or 2001. Currently, we are in the process of negotiating the acquisition of a fleet of approximately 6,800 vehicles which is expected to be closed by the end of the first quarter of 2004. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisition opportunities in our FMS, SCS and DCC business segments in 2004. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities, commercial paper and a sale of receivables program. Debt totaled $1.8 billion at the end of 2003 compared with $1.6 billion at the end of 2002. The increase in debt in 2003 reflects the impact of consolidating debt attributed to VIEs, which was previously reflected as off balance sheet obligations and funding requirements to finance the acquisitions completed during the fourth quarter. VIE related debt at December 31, 2003 totaled $295 million. In 2003, we issued $80 million of medium term notes and retired $76 million of medium term notes. Our outstanding U.S. commercial paper borrowings used to manage our daily cash position decreased to $115 million at December 31, 2003 compared with $118 million at December 31, 2002. During 2003, we added capital lease obligations of $67 million primarily in connection with the extension of existing operating leases of revenue earning equipment. Ryders foreign debt was $205 million at December 31, 2003, a decrease of approximately $33 million from December 31, 2002. The percentage of variable rate financing obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 32% at December 31, 2003, compared with 37% at December 31, 2002. We generally target a variable rate exposure of 25% to 45% of total obligations. Total debt was $1.6 billion at December 31, 2002, a decrease of 9% from December 31, 2001. In 2002, we issued $150 million of medium term notes and retired $166 million of medium term notes. U.S. commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2002 decreased to $118 million, compared with $210 million at December 31, 2001. During 2002, we added capital lease obligations of $67 million primarily in connection with the extension of existing operating leases of revenue earning equipment. Ryders foreign debt was $238 million at December 31, 2002, a decrease of approximately $104 million from December 31, 2001. Our debt to equity and related ratios were as follows: December 31, December 31, 2003 % to Equity 2002 % to Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 1,815,900 135 % $ 1,551,468 140 % PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1),(2) 153,222 370,437 PV of contingent rentals under securitizations(2),(3) 310,955 Total obligations $ 1,969,122 146 % $ 2,232,860 201 % (1) Discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease. (2) Present value does not reflect early termination penalties, which Ryder would be subject to if it terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. (3) Discounted at the average interest rate paid to investors in the securitization trusts. Assumes customers make all lease payments on securitized vehicles when contractually due. 35 Table of Contents Effective July 1, 2003, Ryder consolidated three VIEs in connection with the adoption of FIN 46. As a result, Ryders leverage ratios as of December 31, 2003 have changed to reflect the impact of debt attributed to the VIEs totaling $295 million that would have previously been disclosed as off balance sheet debt (See Off Balance Sheet Arrangements discussion for additional information on these transactions). Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess Ryders overall leverage position. Debt to equity consists of on balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents debt plus the following off balance sheet funding, all divided by total equity: (1) receivables sold, and (2) the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease. Prior to July 1, 2003, total obligations to equity consisted of total obligations, described above, plus the present value of contingent rentals under securitizations (assuming customers make all lease payments on securitized vehicles when contractually due), discounted at the average interest rate paid to investors in the trust, all divided by total equity. The decrease in total obligations to equity ratio in 2003 was driven by reduced funding needs as a result of strong free cash flow levels. Leverage ratios in 2003 were also impacted by the reduction of accumulated other comprehensive loss as well as common stock issuances. These items increased net shareholders equity by approximately $140 million in 2003. Despite the expected increase in capital expenditures in 2004, we anticipate these ratios to remain flat as a result of planned operating performance improvements. Ryder participates in an agreement, as amended from time to time, to sell with limited recourse, trade receivables on a revolving and uncommitted basis. This agreement expires in July 2004. In June 2002, we reduced the amount available for sale under our trade receivable facility from $375 million to $275 million as a result of a reduction in overall working capital needs. Ryder sells receivables in order to fund operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other means of funding, notably, commercial paper. Ryder is responsible for servicing receivables sold, but has no retained interests. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, there were no receivables outstanding under the program. Losses on receivable sales and related costs associated with this program were $0.5 million in 2003, $2 million in 2002 and $9 million in 2001 and are included in miscellaneous income, net. Estimates of losses under the recourse provision are included in accrued liabilities. Since no receivables were sold at the end of 2003 or 2002, no amount of available recourse or recognized recourse obligation existed as of December 31, 2003 and 2002. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A downgrade of Ryders debt rating below investment grade level would limit our ability to issue commercial paper and would result in no longer having the ability to sell trade receivables under the agreement described above. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings as of December 31, 2003 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Negative (December 2001) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB Positive (July 2003) Fitch Ratings F2 BBB+ Stable On January 21, 2004, Fitch Ratings affirmed Ryders ratings and revised our rating outlook to Positive from Stable. 36 Table of Contents We have established an $860 million global revolving credit facility. The facility is composed of a $300 million tranche, which matures in May 2004 and is renewable annually, and a $560 million tranche, which matures in May 2006. The primary purposes of the credit facility are to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys annual facility fee ranges from 12.5 to 15.0 basis points applied to the total facility of $860 million based on Ryders current credit ratings. At December 31, 2003, $701 million was available under this global credit facility. Of this amount, $300 million was available at a maturity of less than one year. Foreign borrowings of $44 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2003. In order to maintain availability of funding, the global revolving credit facility requires Ryder to maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2003 was 120%. During 2003, Ryder filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $107 million of available securities that were carried forward from an existing shelf registration statement. In October 2003, the universal shelf registration statement became effective and Ryder established an $800 million program for the issuance of debt securities. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are expected to be used for capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt refinancings and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2003 Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 701 ($300 limited to less than one year) Shelf registration statement 800 Trade receivables facility 275 (uncommitted basis) We believe such facilities, along with other funding sources, will be sufficient to fund operations in 2004. Off balance Sheet Arrangements We periodically enter into sale and leaseback agreements in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g. regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be VIEs. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. We did not enter into any sale leaseback or securitization transactions during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. Proceeds from a sale leaseback transaction were $411 million in 2001. The sale leaseback transaction in 2001 was a vehicle securitization transaction in which Ryder sold a beneficial interest in certain vehicles subject to leases to a separately rated vehicle lease trust and subsequently entered into a lease with the trust. The activities of the trust and related debt were originally afforded off balance sheet treatment under existing accounting rules. This trust was consolidated effective July 1, 2003 with the adoption of FIN 46. 37 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our undiscounted on and off balance sheet contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2003: 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 323,456 700,325 374,598 338,384 1,736,763 Capital leases 42,955 36,182 79,137 Total debt 366,411 736,507 374,598 338,384 1,815,900 Operating leases(1) 137,698 149,602 63,118 43,069 393,487 Purchase obligations(2) 209,597 71,528 58,420 40,014 379,559 Total contractual cash obligations 347,295 221,130 121,538 83,083 773,046 Other long term liabilities (3),(4) 90,671 41,037 48,373 180,081 Total $ 713,706 1,048,308 537,173 469,840 2,769,027 (1) Represent future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (2) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Significant items included in the above table reflect purchase obligations related to information technology services and vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities. (3) Represent other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams. Significant items included in the above table reflect workers compensation obligations, bodily injury and physical damage obligations, derivative contracts, deferred compensation obligations and legal contractual obligations. (4) The amounts exclude our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, which are $20 million in 2004. Our minimum funding requirements after 2004 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years total $85 million for the U.S. plan and $150 million globally (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other post retirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 19 Employee Benefit Plans in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Guarantees In the ordinary course of business, Ryder provides certain guarantees or indemnifications to third parties as part of certain lease, financing and sales agreements. Certain guarantees and indemnifications, whereby Ryder may be contingently required to make a payment to a third party, are required to be disclosed even if the likelihood of payment is considered remote. As of December 31, 2003, our maximum exposure under these guarantees was $48 million of which $7 million was recognized as a liability. See Note 15 Guarantees in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension Information As of December 31, 2003, we have an accumulated net pension equity charge of $187 million (after tax) in connection with the accrual of an additional minimum pension liability. This equity charge was reduced $41 million from the $229 million (after tax) charge at December 31, 2002, reflecting the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 24% in 2003. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. While we are not legally required to make a contribution to fund our U.S. pension plan until September 2005, we review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans. 38 Table of Contents During 2003, we elected to make a $50 million voluntary contribution to fund our U.S. qualified plan. For 2003, including our international plans, pension contributions totaled $68 million. After considering the 2003 contributions, the projected present value of estimated contributions for all of our plans that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $150 million. Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2004 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2005 and beyond. Share Repurchases In September 2003, Ryders Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate, in part, the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the program, shares of common stock will be purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. As of December 31, 2003, the proceeds generated were $47 million. The program, which extends through September 30, 2005, limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than $90 million. Share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions using working capital, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. In 2003, we purchased 117,500 shares under the program totaling $3.5 million. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 14 Financial Instruments and Risk Management in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2003, we had $1.1 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% and a fair value of $1.2 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2003 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $48 million. At December 31, 2002, we had $878 million of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% and a fair value of $964 million, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2002 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $18 million. We estimate the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2003, we had $588 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $322 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 3.0%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2003 totaled $14 million. As of December 31, 2002, we had $603 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $322 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 3.0%. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2002 totaled $24 million. We estimate a hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted pre tax income by approximately $2 million in both 2003 and 2002. 39 Table of Contents Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. We manage our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We do not generally hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Based on the overall level of transactions denominated in other than local currencies, the lack of transactions between Ryder and foreign subsidiaries and the level of net investment in foreign subsidiaries, the exposure to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates is not considered material. At December 31, 2003, we had a $78 million cross currency swap outstanding used to hedge our investment in a foreign subsidiary. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. As of December 31, 2003, we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of our current fuel purchase arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers and have only a minor effect on profitability. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to prevent, detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million, $1 million and $2 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. We incurred environmental expenses of $12 million, $10 million and $7 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses, such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses should not increase materially from 2003 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 20 Environmental Matters in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. 40 Table of Contents These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely, can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees: We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, SCS and DCC applications). In our estimates, we also make certain assumptions in establishing residual values with respect to future market price trends and the expected recovery of the existing weak used truck market. As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2003, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2004 by approximately $77 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the vehicles. Results of the reviews described above for owned vehicles are also applied to vehicles under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2003, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $11 million were included in accrued expenses (for those payable in less than one year) and in other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2003, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2004 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans: We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return and expected increase in compensation levels. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between actual and assumed experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an 41 Table of Contents unrecognized gain or loss in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We currently have an unrecognized loss of $369 million, of which a portion will be amortized into earnings in 2004. The effect on years beyond 2004 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2003 pension expense is presented in Note 19 Employee Benefit Plans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2004 pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Impact on 2004 Assumed Pension Rate Change Expense Discount rate 6.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $ 4 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $ 2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 5.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $ 1 million Self Insurance Reserves: We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance reserves for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance reserves are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance reserves at December 31, 2003, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2004 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment: We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, at the beginning of the second fiscal quarter or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at a reporting unit level. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of a reporting unit compared to its carrying value. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. In late 2003, a key customer contract of our SCS U.K. reporting unit was not renewed which caused us to assess whether this event resulted in an impairment indicator. Goodwill associated with the SCS U.K. reporting unit totaled $13 million. In light of the profitability of the customer account relative to the entire reporting unit, we did not consider it more likely than not that this event would result in a reduction of our SCS U.K. reporting unit fair value below its carrying amount. There can be no assurance that a further deterioration in the economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance of our SCS U.K. reporting unit or any other of our reporting units will not result in a goodwill impairment loss. At December 31, 2003, goodwill totaled $156 million and represented 3% of our total assets. Income Taxes: Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. We record a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2003, the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $10 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. 42 Table of Contents Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to audit in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report includes non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on our current plans and expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements. Generally, the words believe, expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, will, may and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. Important factors that could cause such differences include, among others: general economic conditions in the U.S. and worldwide; the market for used equipment; the highly competitive environment applicable to our operations (including competition in supply chain solutions from other logistics companies as well as from air cargo, shippers, railroads and motor carriers and competition in full service leasing and commercial rental from companies providing similar services as well as truck and trailer manufacturers that provide leasing, extended warranty maintenance, rental and other transportation services); greater than expected expenses associated with Ryders activities (including increased cost of fuel, freight and transportation) or personnel needs; availability of equipment; adverse changes in debt ratings; changes in accounting assumptions; Ryders ability to create operating synergies in connection with its recent FMS acquisitions; changes in customers business environments (or the loss of a significant customer) or changes in government regulations. The risks included here are not exhaustive. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors or to assess the impact of such risk factors on our business. Accordingly, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required by ITEM 7A is included in ITEM 7 (pages 39 through 40) of PART II of this report.
