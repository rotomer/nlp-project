ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8 of this report on Form 10 K. OVERVIEW Our business is divided into three business segments: our Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment provides leasing, commercial rental and programmed maintenance of commercial trucks, tractors and trailers to customers, principally in the U.S., Canada and the U.K.; our Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) business segment provides comprehensive supply chain consulting and lead logistics management solutions throughout North America and in Latin America, Europe and Asia; and our Dedicated Contract Carriage (DCC) business segment provides vehicles and drivers as part of a dedicated transportation solution in North America. We operate in extremely competitive markets. Our customers select us based on numerous factors including service quality, price, technology and service offerings. As an alternative to using our services, customers may also choose to provide these services for themselves, or may choose to obtain similar or alternative services from other third party vendors. Our customer base includes governments and enterprises operating in a variety of industries including automotive, electronics, high tech, telecommunications, manufacturing, aerospace, consumer goods, paper and paper products, office equipment, food and beverage, and general retail industries. Over the past several years we have made significant transformations in our business, addressing many of the fundamental business processes throughout the organization. From 2000 to 2003, we reduced our cost structure and strengthened our balance sheet in order to deliver long term results to our shareholders and also to make Ryder more competitive in the marketplace. In 2004, we continued this transformation by demonstrating earnings leverage through profitable growth. During 2004, we were successful in growing revenue in our transaction businesses and through strategic acquisitions in our FMS business. As discussed in more detail throughout our MD&A, during 2004: Net earnings increased 64% to $216 million compared with $131 million in 2003. After tax earnings in 2004 benefited from gains on the sale of our headquarters complex of $15 million and net income tax benefits of $9 million associated with developments in various tax matters. Excluding these items, the earnings improvement was driven by the positive impact of FMS acquisitions, improved FMS commercial rental performance, higher gains on FMS used vehicle sales, lower pension costs, and reductions in operating expenses stemming from cost management and process improvement actions. Total revenue increased 7% to $5.2 billion compared with 2003 due to the growth in FMS. During 2004, FMS revenue was positively impacted by acquisitions and higher rental revenue resulting from better pricing and increased activity. Revenue comparisons for 2004 were also favorably impacted by increased FMS fuel services revenue primarily as a result of higher average fuel prices, and foreign currency exchange rate changes related to our international operations. We continued to target strategic opportunities in FMS. In March, Ryder completed the acquisition of Ruan Leasing Company for $148 million. This acquisition enabled us to leverage our existing infrastructure within FMS and drive profitable growth. We also completed two acquisitions related to FMS at the end of 2003. Capital expenditures increased to $1.1 billion compared with $734 million in 2003. The increase in capital expenditures was due primarily to increased activity in our full service lease business for both new and replacement vehicles. Our debt to equity ratio declined to 118% from 135% in 2003. Total obligations to equity ratio declined to 129% from 146% in 2003. The decline in our leverage ratios was driven by our reduced 15 Table of Contents funding needs as a result of improved operating performance and higher proceeds from sales of property and revenue earning equipment. The IRS proposed adjustments related to our 1998 to 2000 tax period which were resolved in February 2005. See Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY BETWEEN PERIODS FMS Acquisitions On March 1, 2004, we completed an asset purchase agreement with Ruan Leasing Company (Ruan) under which we acquired Ruans fleet of approximately 6,400 vehicles, 37 of its 111 service locations and more than 500 customers. Ryder also acquired full service contract maintenance agreements covering approximately 1,700 vehicles. Effective December 31, 2003, we also acquired substantially all the assets of General Car and Truck Leasing System (General), a major privately held commercial truck leasing, maintenance and rental company, including Generals fleet of approximately 4,200 vehicles, 15 of its 34 service locations and more than 700 customers. The combined networks operate under Ryders name and allow us to leverage our existing U.S. infrastructure in key markets while adding new infrastructure to strengthen our presence in targeted areas of the Midwest, Southeast, Mid Atlantic and Southwest. The results of these acquisitions have been included in the consolidated results of Ryder since the dates of acquisitions. Accounting Changes As discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, effective July 1, 2003, Ryder consolidated three variable interest entities (VIEs) in connection with the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Interpretation No. (FIN) 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (as revised by FIN 46 R issued December 2003). The consolidated VIEs were established as part of previous sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment in which Ryder sold revenue earning equipment to special purpose entities and then leased the revenue earning equipment back as lessee under operating lease arrangements. In connection with the sale leaseback transactions executed in the form of vehicle securitizations and a synthetic leasing arrangement, we provided credit enhancements and residual value guarantees that obligated Ryder to absorb the majority of the expected losses from such entities, if any are realized. Therefore, FIN 46 required that these entities be consolidated. The consolidation of the VIEs did not have a significant impact on our consolidated net earnings; however, reported depreciation expense, equipment rental and interest expense were impacted by the consolidation of the VIEs. In addition, both net cash provided by operating activities and our free cash flow measure increased in 2004 and 2003 due to the add back of depreciation expense on the VIEs revenue earning equipment and net cash used in financing activities also increased due to principal payments on VIEs debt. 16 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Years ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands, except per share amounts) Earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles(1) $ 331,122 212,475 175,883 Provision for income taxes(2) 115,513 76,916 63,318 Earnings before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles(1),(2) $ 215,609 135,559 112,565 Per diluted common share $ 3.28 2.12 1.80 Net earnings(1),(2),(3) $ 215,609 131,436 93,666 Per diluted common share $ 3.28 2.06 1.50 Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 65,671 63,871 62,587 (1) Results include restructuring and other (recoveries) charges, net of $(11) million after tax, or $(0.17) per diluted common share, in 2004 and $2 million after tax, or $0.04 per diluted common share, in 2002. See Note 4, Restructuring and Other (Recoveries) Charges, Net, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. (2) 2004 includes a net income tax benefit of $9 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share, associated with developments in various tax matters. See Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. (3) Net earnings for 2003 include the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for (i) variable interest entities resulting in an after tax charge of $3 million, or $0.05 per diluted common share, and (ii) costs associated with eventual retirement of long lived assets primarily relating to components of revenue earning equipment resulting in an after tax charge of $1 million, or $0.02 per diluted common share. Net earnings for 2002 include the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for goodwill resulting in an after tax charge of $19 million, or $0.30 per diluted common share. Earnings before income taxes and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles increased 56% to $331 million in 2004 compared with 2003. Earnings before income taxes in 2004 benefited from gains on the sale of our headquarters complex of $24 million. Net earnings in 2004 benefited from after tax gains on the sale of our headquarters complex of $15 million, or $0.23 per diluted common share, and a net income tax benefit of $9 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share, associated with developments in various tax matters. Excluding these items, the earnings improvement in 2004 was driven by the positive impact of FMS acquisitions, increased FMS rental pricing and utilization, higher gains on FMS used vehicle sales, lower pension costs, and reductions in operating expenses stemming from cost management and process improvement actions. The earnings growth rate in 2004 exceeded the related earnings per share growth rate because the average number of shares outstanding increased 3% over prior year reflecting the impact of stock issuances under employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Earnings before income taxes and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles increased 21% to $212 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase in earnings was due to reductions in operating expenses stemming from cost management and process improving actions, improved SCS operating performance, better FMS rental pricing, and the impact of favorable exchange rate fluctuations. These earnings increases were partially offset by an increase in annual pension expense that principally impacted our FMS business segment, which employs the majority of the employees that participate in our 17 Table of Contents primary U.S. pension plan. See Operating Results by Business Segment for further discussion of operating results for the past three years. Years ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) Revenue: Fleet Management Solutions $ 3,602,839 3,231,675 3,183,022 Supply Chain Solutions 1,354,003 1,362,428 1,388,299 Dedicated Contract Carriage 506,100 514,731 517,961 Eliminations (312,664 ) (306,540 ) (313,017 ) Total $ 5,150,278 4,802,294 4,776,265 Total revenue increased 7% to $5.2 billion in 2004 compared with 2003. During 2004, FMS revenue was positively impacted by acquisitions and higher rental revenue resulting from a larger fleet, better pricing and increased activity. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Revenue comparisons were also impacted by increased FMS fuel services revenue primarily as a result of higher average fuel prices, and favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations. Our businesses realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of higher fuel services revenue as these generally reflect costs that are passed through to our customers. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6% due to the strengthening of the British pound and the Canadian dollar. These increases were partially offset by reduced FMS full service lease revenue on our U.S. base business (excluding acquisitions) and the non renewal of certain customer contracts in our SCS and DCC business segments. Total revenue increased 1% to $4.8 billion in 2003 compared with 2002. Comparisons were impacted by increased FMS fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. During 2003, FMS was negatively impacted by continued softness in the U.S. economy resulting in reduced full service lease and programmed maintenance demand, as well as the impact of some ancillary business not renewed. These decreases were partially offset by improved commercial rental revenue due to higher pricing. SCS revenue decreased in 2003 compared with 2002 as a result of volume reductions combined with the non renewal of certain customer contracts. Revenue comparisons were favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and expanded business in Canada, Latin America and Asia. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.1% due to the strengthening of the British pound and the Canadian dollar offset partially by the weakness of certain Latin American currencies. Years ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) Operating expense $ 2,305,703 2,039,156 1,949,384 Percentage of revenue 45% 42% 41% Operating expense increased 13% to $2.3 billion in 2004 compared with 2003. The increase was principally a result of increases in fuel costs due to higher average fuel prices in 2004. Operating expense was also impacted by higher maintenance costs resulting from a larger and older vehicle fleet and added operating costs attributed to the FMS acquisitions. Operating expense increased 5% to $2.0 billion in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase was principally a result of increases in fuel costs due to higher average fuel prices in 2003. Operating expense was also impacted by higher maintenance costs as a result of an older fleet, offset by a reduction in overhead spending from ongoing cost management actions. 18 Table of Contents Years ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $ 1,233,038 1,242,930 1,268,704 Percentage of revenue 24% 26% 27% Salaries and employee related costs decreased 1% to $1.2 billion in 2004 compared with 2003. The decrease was primarily a result of lower pension expense and lower headcount in our SCS and DCC business segments caused by the non renewal of certain contracts, offset in part by higher performance based incentive compensation. Average headcount decreased 3% in 2004 compared with 2003. The number of employees at December 31, 2004 decreased 1% to approximately 26,300, compared with 26,700 at December 31, 2003. Pension expense decreased $19 million in 2004 to $63 million compared with 2003 and principally impacted FMS. The decrease in pension expense is primarily attributable to the U.S. pension plan and reflects the positive impact of higher actual pension asset returns in 2003. We expect pension expense on a pre tax basis to decrease to approximately $58 million in 2005. Our 2005 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See Critical Accounting Estimates for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. The anticipated decrease in pension expense would primarily impact our FMS business segment. Salaries and employee related costs decreased 2% to $1.2 billion in 2003 compared with 2002. The decrease was a result of headcount reductions, which offset higher pension expense. Average headcount decreased 6% in 2003 compared with 2002 reflecting the non renewal of certain customer contracts, the impact of cost management actions and reduced volumes across all business segments. Years ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) Freight under management expense $ 426,739 414,284 414,369 Percentage of revenue 8% 9% 9% Freight under management (FUM) expense represents subcontracted freight costs on logistics contracts for which Ryder purchases transportation. FUM expense increased 3% to $427 million in 2004 compared with 2003. During 2004, FUM expense in our SCS business segment increased due to the impact of added transportation management based business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs resulting from increased fuel costs. The volume declines experienced in our SCS business during 2004 were principally attributed to non transportation based activities. FUM expense was flat in 2003 compared with 2002 as the net volume declines experienced in our SCS business during 2003 was principally attributed to non transportation management activity. Years ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) Depreciation expense $ 706,028 624,580 552,491 Gains on vehicle sales, net (34,504 ) (15,780 ) (14,223 ) Equipment rental 108,468 200,868 343,531 Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 13% to $706 million in 2004 compared with 2003. The growth in depreciation expense during 2004 reflected the consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003 (approximately $40 million), the impact of vehicles added as part of the recent FMS acquisitions, the conversion of leased units to owned status as a result of lease extensions and the replacement of expiring leased units with owned units. See discussion on FMS in Operating Results by Business Segment for further detail on vehicle counts. Depreciation expense increased 13% to $625 million in 2003 compared with 2002. Although the overall fleet size (owned and leased) declined 3% during 2003, depreciation expense grew because of an increase in the average number of owned (compared with leased) revenue earning equipment units as a result of the 19 Table of Contents consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003 (approximately $40 million), the conversion of leased units to owned status on lease extensions and the replacement of expiring leased units with owned units. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased 119% to $35 million in 2004 compared with 2003 and 11% to $16 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The increases in gains on vehicle sales were due to increases in the number of FMS unit sales of owned vehicles and improvements in the average pricing on vehicles sold over the preceding periods. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See Critical Accounting Estimates for further discussion on depreciation and residual value guarantees. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in losses on disposal. Equipment rental primarily consists of rental costs on revenue earning equipment in FMS. Equipment rental costs decreased 46% to $108 million in 2004 compared with 2003. The significant decrease in 2004 was due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles (compared with owned) resulting from the consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003 (approximately $50 million), the conversion of leased units to owned status as a result of lease extensions and the replacement of expiring lease units with owned units. Equipment rental costs decreased 42% to $201 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The decrease was due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles (compared with owned) resulting from the consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003 (approximately $50 million), term extensions and an overall decline in fleet size, which principally impacted equipment under lease. Years ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) Interest expense $ 100,114 96,169 91,718 Percentage of revenue 2% 2% 2% Interest expense increased 4% to $100 million in 2004 compared with 2003. The increase in interest expense reflects higher average debt levels, including debt of consolidated VIEs. Excluding interest expense from consolidated VIEs, comparisons for 2004 were favorably impacted by overall lower market interest rates and reduced effective interest rates as a result of hedging transactions, which principally benefited FMS. Interest expense increased 5% to $96 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase in interest expense reflects the impact of interest expense of approximately $10 million on debt of VIEs consolidated effective July 1, 2003, partially offset by overall lower market interest rates and reduced effective interest rates as a result of hedging transactions, which principally benefited FMS. Years ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) Miscellaneous income, net $ (8,754 ) (12,158 ) (9,808 ) Miscellaneous income, net decreased to $9 million in 2004 compared with 2003. Miscellaneous income, net decreased because of the elimination of servicing fee income related to certain VIEs. Prior to the consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003, miscellaneous income, net included fee income related to administrative services provided to vehicle lease trusts in connection with vehicle securitization transactions. As a result of consolidating the vehicle securitization trusts, we no longer recognize service fee income. Miscellaneous income, net increased to $12 million in 2003 compared with 2002. During 2003, miscellaneous income, net was favorably impacted from a $2 million gain on sale of a facility in our European FMS operations, better market performance of investments classified as trading securities used to fund certain benefit plans and lower losses on the sale of trade receivables related to the decreased use 20 Table of Contents of our revolving receivables financing program. These positive factors were partially offset by the elimination of servicing fee income related to the vehicle lease trusts. Years ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) Restructuring and other (recoveries) charges, net $ (17,676 ) (230 ) 4,216 Restructuring and other (recoveries) charges, net in 2004 relate primarily to $24 million in gains from properties sold in connection with the relocation of our headquarters complex. During 2004 we also recorded other charges related to the termination of certain services covered by an information technology contract. In accordance with the terms of the services agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate certain services and recorded charges totaling $8 million for contract termination ($6 million) and transition costs incurred since termination ($2 million). By December 31, 2004, all transition activities were completed and we expect future cost reductions associated with the termination of these services to benefit our results starting in 2005. Restructuring and other (recoveries) charges, net were $(0.2) million in 2003. During 2003, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 140 positions as a result of on going cost management and process improvement actions in Ryders FMS and SCS business segments and Central Support Services (CSS). The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $6 million. These charges were offset by the settlement of a commercial dispute pertaining to prior billings with an information technology vendor, gains on sales of owned facilities identified for closure in prior restructuring charges, and reversals of severance and employee related costs associated with prior restructuring charges. Restructuring and other (recoveries) charges, net were $4 million in 2002. During the fourth quarter of 2002, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 140 positions as a result of cost management actions principally in our SCS business segment and CSS, which were substantially finalized at December 31, 2002. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $7 million. These charges were offset by net gains on sales of owned facilities identified for closure in prior restructuring charges, reversals of severance and employee related costs associated with prior restructuring charges and the final settlement of insurance reserves attributed to a previously sold business. See Note 4, Restructuring and Other (Recoveries) Charges, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Years ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) Provision for income taxes $ 115,513 76,916 63,318 Effective tax rate 34.9% 36.2% 36.0% The 2004 effective tax rate reflects the completion of the audit of our federal income tax returns for the 1995 to 1997 period, partially offset by provisions made for loss contingencies related to recent developments in the audit of our federal income tax returns for the 1998 through 2000 period. The net effect of these items was an increase in net earnings of $9 million. 21 Table of Contents OPERATING RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT Years ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) Revenue: Fleet Management Solutions $ 3,602,839 3,231,675 3,183,022 Supply Chain Solutions 1,354,003 1,362,428 1,388,299 Dedicated Contract Carriage 506,100 514,731 517,961 Eliminations (312,664 ) (306,540 ) (313,017 ) Total $ 5,150,278 4,802,294 4,776,265 NBT: Fleet Management Solutions $ 312,706 194,940 214,692 Supply Chain Solutions 37,079 40,064 (7,485 ) Dedicated Contract Carriage 29,450 35,259 32,113 Eliminations (32,728 ) (33,586 ) (34,636 ) 346,507 236,677 204,684 Unallocated Central Support Services (33,061 ) (24,432 ) (24,585 ) Restructuring and other recoveries (charges), net 17,676 230 (4,216 ) Earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles $ 331,122 212,475 175,883 We define the primary measurement of our segment financial performance as Net Before Tax (NBT) which includes an allocation of CSS and excludes restructuring and other recoveries (charges), net. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all of our business segments, including sales and marketing, human resources, finance, corporate services, shared management information systems, customer solutions, health and safety, legal and communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each of our business segments and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. In 2004, we changed our methodology of allocating sales support costs between FMS and DCC segments and allocating insurance related costs between FMS, SCS and DCC segments. Accordingly, 2003 and 2002 segment NBT measures have been adjusted to provide the retroactive effect of these changes. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, corporate communications, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 22, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at approximate fair value as if the transactions were made with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) is included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 22 Table of Contents The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 14,971 15,319 15,454 Dedicated Contract Carriage 17,757 18,267 19,182 Total $ 32,728 33,586 34,636 Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Fleet Management Solutions Years ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) Full service lease and programmed maintenance $ 1,896,041 1,791,478 1,795,254 Commercial rental 590,984 490,864 458,355 Other 313,616 308,606 346,770 Dry revenue(1) 2,800,641 2,590,948 2,600,379 Fuel services revenue 802,198 640,727 582,643 Total revenue $ 3,602,839 3,231,675 3,183,022 Segment NBT $ 312,706 194,940 214,692 Segment NBT as a % of total revenue 8.7% 6.0% 6.7% Segment NBT as a % of dry revenue(1) 11.2% 7.5% 8.3% (1) We use dry revenue, a non GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of our FMS business segment and as a measure of sales activity. Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our dry revenue computation, as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in fuel services revenue. 2004 versus 2003 FMS total revenue increased 11% to $3.6 billion in 2004 compared with 2003. Fuel services revenue increased 25% to $802 million primarily as a result of higher average fuel prices and higher volumes attributed to recent acquisitions. Dry revenue (revenue excluding fuel) increased 8% to $2.8 billion in 2004 compared with 2003. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $177 million of revenue in 2004. FMS total revenue and dry revenue comparisons for 2004 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. Full service lease and programmed maintenance revenue increased 6% to $1.9 billion in 2004 compared with 2003 primarily from acquisitions that added approximately 7,000 vehicles to our lease fleet. Comparisons were also favorably impacted by higher revenue in Canada and the U.K. as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue on our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) as a result of weak leasing demand in 2003 and flat net sales in 2004. In 2005, we expect growth in full service lease and programmed maintenance revenue due to recent sales activity and continued emphasis on initiatives aimed at generating new sales. Commercial rental revenue increased 20% to $591 million in 2004 compared with 2003. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of higher rental pricing and utilization in each of our markets and a 23 Table of Contents larger fleet size. Commercial rental revenue in 2004 also benefited from revenue contributions attributed to the recent acquisitions. U.S. rental fleet utilization increased to 77% in 2004 compared with 72% in 2003. In the U.S., pure rental revenue (total revenue less rental revenue related to units provided to full service lease customers), which accounts for over half of the U.S. commercial rental business, increased 14% to $269 million in 2004 compared with $235 million in 2003 due to stronger pricing and increased rental activity. Lease customer revenue primarily represents rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. In the U.S., lease customer revenue increased 29% to $224 million in 2004 compared with the prior year. Rental statistics presented are for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue to improve in 2005 based on the increases in rental transactions, improved pricing discipline and an overall larger commercial rental fleet. Other FMS revenue, which consists of trailer rentals, other maintenance and repairs services and ancillary revenue to support product lines, increased 2% to $314 million in 2004 compared with 2003. Other revenue increased due primarily to higher trailer utilization and higher overall volumes. We expect modest improvements in 2005 due to recent increases in U.S. activity. FMS NBT increased 60% to $313 million in 2004 compared with 2003. The increase was driven by the acquisitions that allowed us to leverage our existing infrastructure, improved commercial rental results from higher rental pricing and utilization, higher gains on disposal of used revenue earning equipment from stronger pricing and volume, and lower pension costs. The impact of these items was partially offset by lower full service lease and programmed maintenance revenue on our base business (excluding acquired contracts). 2003 versus 2002 FMS total revenue increased 2% to $3.2 billion in 2003 compared with 2002. Revenue in 2003 was impacted by increases in fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices, particularly during the first half of 2003. Dry revenue totaling $2.6 billion remained unchanged in 2003 compared with 2002. In 2003, FMS total revenue and dry revenue also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.4%. Full service lease and programmed maintenance revenue remained unchanged in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to the effects of weak leasing demand in the U.S., a reduction in fleet size and fewer total miles run by leased vehicles, which resulted in decreased variable billings. The impact of these negative factors was partially offset by higher revenue in Canada and the U.K. as a result of favorable exchange rates and higher volumes. Commercial rental revenue increased 7% to $491 million in 2003 compared with 2002 primarily as a result of stronger pricing throughout 2003. U.S. rental fleet utilization for 2003 of 72% was unchanged from 2002. Other FMS revenue decreased 11% to $309 million in 2003 compared with 2002 due primarily to the non renewal of a customer contract to provide ancillary fleet services that expired at the end of the first quarter of 2003. FMS NBT decreased 9% to $195 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The decrease was due primarily to higher pension expense of $48 million in 2003 as compared with 2002. NBT comparisons were also adversely impacted by lower lease revenue and the non renewal of a contract to provide ancillary fleet services. The impact of these items was partially offset by higher commercial rental pricing, improved asset management performance resulting from lower vehicle counts and carrying costs, reduced operating expenses as a result of our cost management and process improvement actions and the impact of favorable exchange rate fluctuations. 24 Table of Contents Our fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): December 31 Number of Units 2004 2003 By type: Trucks 63,700 62,400 Tractors 51,700 48,900 Trailers 43,100 43,200 Other 5,900 5,700 Total 164,400 160,200 By product line: Full service lease 119,700 118,900 Commercial rental 41,700 38,500 Service and other vehicles 3,000 2,800 Total 164,400 160,200 Owned(1) 157,000 150,200 Leased 7,400 10,000 Total 164,400 160,200 Full year average 164,300 160,000 (1) Effective March 1, 2004, approximately 6,400 units were added to the fleet as part of the Ruan acquisition. The totals in the table above include the following non revenue earning equipment (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): December 31 Number of Units 2004 2003 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 1,900 1,100 No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale 4,800 5,000 Other NLE units 1,600 2,000 Total(1) 8,300 8,100 (1) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,500 vehicles in 2004 and 1,000 vehicles in 2003, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. NLE units represent vehicles held for sale, as well as vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. These vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. The number of NYE units increased during the year consistent with the anticipated higher level of new vehicles coming into the fleet for replacement lease equipment and new lease sales. We would expect this number to grow in 2005 as the volume of lease activity increases. In 2004, the number of other NLE units declined as a result of improved rental utilization. 25 Table of Contents Supply Chain Solutions Years ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) U.S. operating revenue: Automotive, aerospace and industrial $ 425,103 419,655 439,489 High tech and consumer industries 230,030 247,475 295,428 Transportation management 20,331 15,076 14,649 U.S. operating revenue 675,464 682,206 749,566 International operating revenue 261,479 270,316 228,206 Total operating revenue(1) 936,943 952,522 977,772 Freight under management (FUM) expense 417,060 409,906 410,527 Total revenue $ 1,354,003 1,362,428 1,388,299 Segment NBT $ 37,079 40,064 (7,485 ) Segment NBT as a % of total revenue 2.7% 2.9% (0.5% ) Segment NBT as a % of operating revenue(1) 4.0% 4.2% (0.8% ) (1) We use operating revenue, a non GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of our SCS business segment and as a measure of sales activity. FUM expense is deducted from total revenue to arrive at our operating revenue computation as FUM expense is largely a pass through to customers. Ryder realizes minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in FUM expense. 2004 versus 2003 SCS total revenue remained flat at $1.4 billion in 2004 compared with 2003. SCS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2%. Operating revenue (which excludes FUM) decreased 2% to $937 million in 2004 compared with 2003. U.S. and international operating revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by the non renewal of certain customer contracts. Additionally, international operating revenue in 2003 included $21 million associated with an inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk and required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. The unfavorable operating revenue comparisons were partially offset by new contract start ups and expansions in the U.S., Canada and Latin America and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. SCS operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. We are encouraged by recent sales activity and expect to convert more sales proposals into new contracts in 2005 by expanding sales efforts. As we enter 2005, we are watchful of economic indicators in the U.S. automotive sector, which currently suggest weaker volumes in the first half of 2005. SCS NBT decreased 7% to $37 million in 2004 compared with 2003. The decrease in SCS NBT for 2004 was due primarily to lower operating revenue. The impact of revenue declines during 2004 was partially offset by reduced overhead spending through continued profit improvement actions. 2003 versus 2002 SCS total revenue decreased 2% to $1.4 billion in 2003 compared with 2002. Operating revenue decreased 3% to $953 million in 2003 compared with 2002. U.S. operating revenue decreased 9% in 2003 compared with 2002 as a result of reduced volume levels in some of our customer segments and the non renewal of certain contracts. The revenue reductions in the U.S. were partially offset by increased volumes and expanded business in Canada, Latin America and Asia, as well as the favorable impact of exchange rates. SCS total and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.6% due 26 Table of Contents to the strengthening of the British pound and the Canadian dollar offset partially by the weakness of certain Latin American currencies. International revenue comparisons were also favorably impacted by revenue from an inventory procurement contract that generated $21 million in revenue in 2003. In the first quarter of 2004, the terms of this contract were favorably renegotiated to eliminate inventory risk and required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS NBT improved to $40 million in 2003 compared with a deficit of $7 million in 2002. Despite lower operating revenue in 2003, SCS improved results were driven by numerous profit improvement actions implemented by management, which reduced overhead costs and improved global operating performance. Dedicated Contract Carriage Years ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) Operating revenue(1) $ 496,421 510,353 514,119 Freight under management (FUM) expense 9,679 4,378 3,842 Total revenue $ 506,100 514,731 517,961 Segment NBT $ 29,450 35,259 32,113 Segment NBT as a % of total revenue 5.8% 6.8% 6.2% Segment NBT as a % of operating revenue(1) 5.9% 6.9% 6.2% (1) We use operating revenue, a non GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of our DCC business segment and as a measure of sales activity. FUM expense is deducted from total revenue to arrive at our operating revenue computation as FUM expense is largely a pass through to customers. Ryder realizes minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in FUM expense. 2004 versus 2003 DCC revenue decreased 2% to $506 million in 2004 compared with 2003. DCC operating revenue decreased 3% to $496 million in 2004 compared with 2003. The revenue decrease was due to the non renewal of certain customer contracts, partially offset by the pass through of higher average fuel prices. NBT decreased 16% to $29 million in 2004 compared with 2003. The decrease in NBT for 2004 reflects the impact of lower revenue, increased driver costs and higher safety and insurance expenses partially offset by lower overhead spending. In 2005, we expect to complete the operational integration of our DCC business with our SCS organization. We expect this action along with the projected expansion of our SCS/ DCC sales organizations to accelerate revenue growth in 2005. 2003 versus 2002 DCC total revenue decreased 1% to $515 million in 2003 compared with 2002. DCC operating revenue decreased 1% to $510 million in 2003 compared with 2002. Reduced volumes associated with customer contracts not renewed were partially offset by the pass through of higher average fuel prices in 2003. NBT increased 10% to $35 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase in NBT for 2003 reflects decreased overhead spending and improved operating performance. These improvements were partially offset by the impact of customer contracts not renewed. Lower salaries and employee related costs, sales and marketing costs, and insurance costs contributed to the lower overhead spending. 27 Table of Contents Central Support Services CSS expenses were as follows: Years ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) Sales and marketing $ 7,057 8,964 12,636 Human resources 13,982 18,000 21,151 Finance 56,136 55,180 58,498 Corporate services/public affairs 9,196 7,314 7,672 Information technology 69,457 78,084 89,092 Health and safety 8,303 8,199 9,192 Other 50,480 37,275 35,191 Total CSS 214,611 213,016 233,432 Allocation of CSS to business segments (181,550 ) (188,584 ) (208,847 ) Unallocated CSS $ 33,061 24,432 24,585 2004 versus 2003 Total CSS increased 1% to $215 million in 2004 compared with 2003. The increase in total CSS expenses during 2004 compared with 2003 was due to higher performance based incentive compensation costs attributed to the improved overall performance. This increase was partially offset by on going cost containment and process improvement actions, most notably in information technology (IT). Technology costs were lower in 2004 due primarily to reduced pricing on purchased IT services. Unallocated CSS expenses for 2004 were up largely due to Sarbanes Oxley compliance costs that were not allocated to the business segments and higher performance based incentive compensation. We expect reductions in CSS spending levels over the near term based on continuing cost containment and process improvement actions. 2003 versus 2002 Total CSS decreased 9% to $213 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The decrease in total CSS expense was due to cost reductions across substantially all functional areas as a result of our continued cost management and process improvement actions, most notably in IT. Technology costs were lower in 2003 as a result of reduced pricing on purchased IT services and the impact of insourcing certain IT services during the first quarter of 2002. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 883,034 811,302 614,703 Financing activities (195,760 ) (232,796 ) (269,508 ) Investing activities (726,930 ) (542,116 ) (358,824 ) Net cash flows from operations $ (39,656 ) 36,390 (13,629 ) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to improved operating performance and the add back of depreciation expense attributed to VIEs that were 28 Table of Contents consolidated effective July 1, 2003. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2003 compared with 2002 was primarily attributable to changes in the aggregate balance of trade receivables sold, improved operating performance and reduced working capital needs. This increase was partially offset by higher discretionary cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans. Cash used in financing activities decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher debt borrowings and proceeds from stock option exercises were partially offset by increased stock repurchases. Cash used in financing activities decreased in 2003 compared to 2002 due to lower debt payments and increased proceeds from stock option exercises. Debt levels in 2003 compared with 2002 were also impacted by the conversion of off balance sheet obligations to debt attributed to VIEs consolidated effective July 1, 2003. Principal payments on consolidated VIE debt totaled $119 million in 2003. Cash used in investing activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due to higher capital expenditures and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions. Capital expenditures increased in 2004 due to planned higher levels of vehicle replacements for equipment under lease to our customers and new lease sales. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions completed during the third quarter of 2004. Cash used in investing activities increased in 2003 compared with 2002 due to higher capital expenditures, primarily to refresh our commercial rental fleet. Additionally, 2003 investing activities reflect payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions. We manage our business to maximize operating cash flows and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities (excluding changes in the aggregate balance of trade receivables sold) and investing activities as free cash flow. Although free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure, we consider it to be an important measure of comparative operating performance. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 883,034 811,302 614,703 Changes in the aggregate balance of trade receivables sold 110,000 Collections on direct finance leases 63,795 61,368 66,489 Sales of property and revenue earning equipment 352,335 222,888 152,685 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 96,801 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,091,582 ) (733,577 ) (582,217 ) Acquisitions (148,791 ) (96,518 ) Other, net 512 3,723 4,219 Free cash flow $ 156,104 269,186 365,879 Free cash flow decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher capital spending and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions offset better operating performance, higher proceeds from sales of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions. Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow comparisons in the first half of 2004 were also positively impacted by the add back of depreciation expense of approximately $40 million attributed to VIEs that were consolidated as a result of the adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. Free cash flow decreased in 2003 compared with 2002 as higher capital spending, including acquisitions, offset better operating performance and higher proceeds from sale of used vehicles. We expect free cash flow levels to decline in 2005 as a result of the increased capital spending requirements and increased income tax payments, including the 29 Table of Contents payment made in connection with the audit of our federal income tax returns for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Our FMS operations are capital intensive, characterized by significant investments primarily in vehicles (revenue earning equipment). Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 862,994 459,239 536,151 Commercial rental 241,858 219,880 20,177 1,104,852 679,119 556,328 Operating property and equipment 59,767 46,011 43,973 Total capital expenditures 1,164,619 725,130 600,301 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (73,037 ) 8,447 (18,084 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,091,582 733,577 582,217 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $54 million, $67 million and $67 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to increased activity in our full service lease business for both new and replacement vehicles. Capital expenditures increased in 2003 compared with 2002 due to higher levels of vehicle replacements, primarily for the commercial rental fleet. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low in 2003 and 2002 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. As a result of our fleet age and anticipated higher levels of new sales activity, total capital expenditures are anticipated to increase to approximately $1.4 billion in 2005, including vehicle replacements of approximately $1.0 billion and spending for anticipated incremental growth of approximately $300 million. We expect to fund 2005 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In March 2004, Ryder completed one acquisition related to the FMS segment. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Ryder completed two acquisitions related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $149 million in 2004 and $97 million in 2003. Approximately $13 million is due to the sellers at December 31, 2004 and will be paid, subject to holdback provisions set forth in the purchase agreements. No acquisitions were completed in 2002. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2005. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. 30 Table of Contents The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2004 2003 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 1,815,900 1,551,468 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 79,033 (2,500 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 135,000 80,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 147,153 25,115 Retirement of medium term notes (72,000 ) (75,500 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (384,932 ) (264,933 ) (95,746 ) (237,818 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (9,380 ) (9,997 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 54,094 66,861 Addition of variable interest entity debt 413,983 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 18,348 31,403 Total changes in debt (32,684 ) 264,432 Debt balance at December 31 $ 1,783,216 1,815,900 Our funding philosophy generally attempts to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25 45% variable rate debt. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 37% at December 31, 2004, compared with 32% at December 31, 2003. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2004 Equity 2003 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 1,783,216 118% $ 1,815,900 135% PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for equipment(1) 161,138 153,222 Total obligations $ 1,944,354 129% $ 1,969,122 146% (1) Present value does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess Ryders overall leverage position. The decrease in total obligations to equity ratio in 2004 was driven by our reduced funding needs as a result of improved operating performance and higher proceeds from sales of property and revenue earning equipment. Leverage ratios in 2004 were also impacted by the net increase in shareholders equity of $166 million resulting primarily from earnings net of common stock repurchases. We anticipate these ratios will increase in 2005 as a result of the expected increase in capital expenditures and higher income tax payments. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk 31 Table of Contents associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A downgrade of Ryders debt rating below investment grade level would limit our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2004 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB Positive (July 2003) Fitch Ratings F2 BBB+ Positive (January 2004) During May 2004, Ryder refinanced its $860 million credit facility with a new five year $870 million global revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility is used to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. The credit facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2004). Foreign borrowings of $24 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2004. At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 15.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2004 was 99%. During 2003, Ryder filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to $800 million of available securities. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are expected to be used for capital expenditures, debt refinancing and general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2004 Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 646 Shelf registration statement 665 As of February 22, 2005, the amount available under the global revolving credit facility decreased to $408 million, primarily as a result of the payment made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 period. See Note 11, Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. We believe such facilities, along with other funding sources, will be sufficient to fund operations in 2005. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans and insurance companies) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be VIEs. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. These leases contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles 32 Table of Contents (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. We did not enter into any sale leaseback or vehicle securitization transactions during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. See Note 12, Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Ryder participated in an agreement to sell with limited recourse trade receivables on a revolving and uncommitted basis. This agreement expired in December 2004. Under the program, Ryder sold receivables from time to time in order to fund operations, particularly when the cost of such sales was cost effective compared with other means of funding, notably, commercial paper. Losses on receivable sales and related costs associated with this program were $0.5 million, $0.5 million and $2 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and were included in Miscellaneous income, net. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2004: 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 354,482 571,778 542,108 261,451 1,729,819 Capital lease obligations 35,068 18,181 148 53,397 Total debt 389,550 589,959 542,256 261,451 1,783,216 Interest on debt(1) 93,062 125,201 67,991 197,890 484,144 Operating leases(2) 106,326 145,434 63,246 77,494 392,500 Purchase obligations(3) 81,685 48,494 43,014 6,960 180,153 Total contractual cash obligations 281,073 319,129 174,251 282,344 1,056,797 Self insurance obligations 97,822 90,777 33,664 43,443 265,706 Other long term liabilities(4),(5) 18,855 1,454 16,859 37,168 Total $ 768,445 1,018,720 751,625 604,097 3,142,887 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2004. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant items included in the above table are purchase obligations related to information technology services and vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses. (4) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were derivative contracts, deferred compensation obligations and legal contractual obligations. (5) The amounts exclude our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, which are $4 million in 2006. Our minimum funding requirements after 2006 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $80 million for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 19, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 33 Table of Contents Guarantees In the ordinary course of business, Ryder provides certain guarantees or indemnifications to third parties as part of certain lease, financing and sales agreements. Certain guarantees and indemnifications, whereby Ryder may be contingently required to make a payment to a third party, are required to be disclosed even if the likelihood of payment is considered remote. At December 31, 2004, our maximum exposure under these guarantees was $26 million of which $3 million was recognized as a liability. See Note 15, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension Information At December 31, 2004, we have an accumulated net pension equity charge of $189 million (after tax) in connection with the accrual of an additional minimum pension liability, up slightly as compared with $187 million (after tax) at December 31, 2003 as discount rates and updates to our mortality estimates offset the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 11% in 2004. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. While we are not legally required to make a contribution to fund our U.S. pension plan until September 2006, we review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans. During 2004, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were approximately $70 million. After considering the 2004 contributions, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $80 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2005 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2006 and beyond. Share Repurchases and Cash Dividends In 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate, in part, the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003, up to $90 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the share repurchase program. In 2004, we purchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of $87 million. In 2003, we purchased and retired 117,500 shares at an aggregate cost of $3 million. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a new two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under this program, shares of common stock are purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees since May 1, 2004, which totaled approximately 1.6 million shares at December 31, 2004. The program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. At December 31, 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of $62 million. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the repurchase program. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $39 million in 2004, $38 million in 2003 and $37 million in 2002. In February 2005, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.01 increase from the $0.15 quarterly cash dividend Ryder has paid since 1989. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not 34 Table of Contents enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 14, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% and a fair value of $1.2 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2004 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2003, we had $1.1 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% and a fair value of $1.2 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2003 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $48 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2004, we had $607 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $285 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2004, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements totaled $5 million. At December 31, 2003, we had $588 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $322 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 3.0%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2003 totaled $14 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2005 pre tax earnings by approximately $2 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $16 million and $9 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.1 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $9 million and $7 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2004, we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers 35 Table of Contents and have only a minor effect on profitability. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2004, $1 million in 2003 and $1 million in 2002. We incurred environmental expenses of $10 million, $12 million and $10 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses, such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2004 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 20, Environmental Matters in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely, can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees: We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. Based 36 Table of Contents on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2004, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2005 by approximately $85 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2004, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $6 million were included in Accrued expenses (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2004, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2005 by approximately $3 million. Pension Plans: We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. For 2004, in order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we used models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. This method resulted in a discount rate about 0.15% higher than our prior year method. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid out of plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in Note 19, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an unrecognized loss of $371 million at the end of 2004 compared with a loss of $369 million at the end of 2003. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2004 results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and updates to our mortality estimates, offset in part by assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates and the amortization of the opening balance. A portion of the unrecognized actuarial loss will be amortized into earnings in 2005. The effect on years beyond 2005 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2004 net pension expense is presented in Note 19, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2005 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Impact on 2005 Net Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Discount rate 5.90% +/ 0.25% /+ $ 4 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $ 2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $ 1 million 37 Table of Contents Self Insurance Accruals: We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2004, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2005 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment: We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. In late 2003, a key customer contract of our SCS U.K. reporting unit was not renewed which caused us to assess whether this event resulted in an impairment indicator. In light of the profitability of the customer account relative to the entire reporting unit, we did not consider it more likely than not that this event would result in a reduction of our SCS U.K. reporting unit fair value below its carrying amount. Since that time, we have performed our annual impairment test for the SCS U.K. reporting unit resulting in no goodwill impairment. There can be no assurance that a deterioration in the economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance of our SCS U.K. reporting unit or any other reporting unit will not result in a goodwill impairment loss. At December 31, 2004, goodwill totaled $158 million, of which $14 million related to our SCS U.K. reporting unit. Income Taxes: Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million and $10 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and 38 Table of Contents unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. In 2003, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Since November 2004, the IRS proposed adjustments that challenged certain of our tax positions taken in the years under audit and proposed penalties for the underpayment of tax. In February 2005, we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and proposed penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005, we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carry forwards), including interest through the date of payment. The payment was funded through the issuance of commercial paper. The amount we paid is consistent with our accrual as of December 31, 2004, and is included in Accrued expenses. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 and 2002. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to FMS dry revenue, FMS NBT as a % of dry revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total obligations and total obligations to equity. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 39 Table of Contents FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AND FACTORS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS Forward looking statements (within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) are statements that relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends concerning matters that are not historical facts.

These statements, as well as other forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report, are based on our current plans and expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We caution readers that certain important factors could cause actual results and events to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward looking statements. These risk factors include, but are not limited to, the following: Market Conditions: o Changes in general economic conditions in the U.S. and worldwide leading to decreased demand for our services, lower profit margins and increased levels of bad debt o Changes in our customers operations, financial condition or business environment that may limit their need for, or ability to purchase, our services o Changes in market conditions affecting the commercial rental market or the sale of used vehicles 40 Table of Contents o Less than anticipated growth rates in the markets in which we operate Competition: o Competition from other service providers, some of which have greater capital resources or lower capital costs o Continued consolidation in the markets in which we operate which may create large competitors with greater financial resources o Competition from vehicle manufacturers in our foreign FMS business operations o Our inability to maintain current pricing levels due to customer acceptance or competition Profitability: o Our inability to obtain adequate profit margins for our services o Lower than expected customer retention levels o Loss of a large customer or customer base o Our inability to adapt our product offerings to meet changing consumer preferences on a cost effective basis o The inability of our business segments to create operating efficiencies o Availability of heavy and medium duty vehicles o Increases in fuel prices o Our inability to successfully implement our asset management initiatives o An increase in the cost of, or shortages in the availability of, qualified drivers o Labor strikes and work stoppages o Our ability to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits of recent and future acquisitions o Our inability to manage our cost structure o Our inability to limit our exposure for customer claims Government Regulation: o Cost of compliance with new or changing government regulations, including regulations regarding vehicle emissions, drivers, hours of service and anti terrorism and security regulations issued by the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Customs Service Financing Concerns: o Higher borrowing costs and possible decreases in available funding sources caused by an adverse change in our debt ratings o Unanticipated interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations o Negative funding status of our pension plans caused by lower than expected returns on invested assets and unanticipated changes in interest rates Accounting Matters: o Impact of unusual items resulting from on going evaluations of business strategies, asset valuations, acquisitions, divestitures and organizational structure o Reductions in residual values or useful lives of revenue earning equipment 41 Table of Contents o Increases in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality resulting in higher pension expense o Increases in healthcare costs resulting in higher insurance reserves o Changes in accounting rules, assumptions and accruals Other risks detailed from time to time in our SEC filings The risks included here are not exhaustive. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors or to assess the impact of such risk factors on our business. As a result, no assurance can be given as to our future results or achievements. You should not place undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report. We do not intend, or assume any obligation, to update or revise any forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
