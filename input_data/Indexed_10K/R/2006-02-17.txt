ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8 of this report on Form 10 K. OVERVIEW Ryder System, Inc. (Ryder), is a global leader in transportation and supply chain management solutions. Our business is divided into three business segments, which operate in extremely competitive markets. Our customers select us based on numerous factors including service quality, price, technology and service offerings. As an alternative to using our services, customers may also choose to provide these services for themselves, or may choose to obtain similar or alternative services from other third party vendors. Our customer base includes enterprises operating in a variety of industries including automotive, electronics, high tech, telecommunications, industrial, consumer goods, paper and paper products, office equipment, food and beverage, general retail industries, and governments. The Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment is our largest segment providing full service leasing, contract maintenance, contract related maintenance, and commercial rental of trucks, tractors and trailers to customers in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. FMS revenue and assets in 2005 were $3.56 billion and $5.45 billion, respectively, representing 62% of our consolidated revenue and 90% of consolidated assets. The Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) business segment provides comprehensive supply chain consulting and lead logistics management solutions throughout North America and in Latin America, Europe and Asia. SCS revenue in 2005 was $1.64 billion, representing 29% of our consolidated revenue. The Dedicated Contract Carriage (DCC) business segment provides vehicles and drivers as part of a dedicated transportation solution in North America. DCC revenue in 2005 was $543 million, representing 9% of our consolidated revenue. As discussed in more detail throughout our MD&A, during 2005: Our total revenue was $5.74 billion, up 11% from $5.15 billion in 2004. All business segments contributed to the total revenue growth. The growth in FMS revenue was driven by increased fuel services revenue primarily as a result of higher average fuel prices and better rental revenue due to stronger pricing. The growth in SCS revenue was driven primarily by increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation as well as new and expanded business in all industry groups. The growth in DCC revenue was driven by new and expanded business, and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. Comparisons for 2005 were also impacted by favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations. Earnings from continuing operations were $228 million compared with $216 million in 2004 while earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations increased to $3.53 from $3.28 in 2004. o Earnings for 2005 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share, related to a change in Ohio income tax law. o Earnings for 2004 included a net income tax benefit of $9 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share, associated with the resolution of various federal tax matters related to audits from 1995 to 2000, and after tax gains on the sale of our headquarters complex of $15 million, or $0.23 per diluted common share. Excluding the non operating items listed above, comparable earnings from continuing operations were $220 million, up 15% from $191 million in 2004. Comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations were $3.41, up 17% from $2.91 in 2004. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Net earnings were $227 million, up 5% from $216 million in 2004. o Net earnings for 2005 included (i) income from discontinued operations associated with the reduction of insurance reserves related to discontinued operations resulting in an after tax benefit of $2 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, and (ii) the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for costs associated with the future removal of underground storage tanks resulting in an after tax charge of $2 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share. All business segments contributed to the strong results. The earnings growth was driven primarily by improved FMS commercial rental performance, higher gains on FMS used vehicle sales and reductions in operating expenses resulting from ongoing cost reduction activities and process improvement actions across all business segments. Capital expenditures increased to $1.41 billion compared with $1.16 billion in 2004. The increase in capital spending reflects higher vehicle replacements primarily related to the FMS lease product line. Our debt to equity ratio increased to 143% from 118% in 2004. Total obligations (including off balance sheet debt) to equity ratio increased to 151% from 129% in 2004. The increases in leverage ratios were driven by our increased funding requirements as a result of higher vehicle capital spending, higher income tax payments and stock repurchases. We repurchased a total of 3.7 million shares of common stock in 2005 for $152 million. We also increased our annual dividend by 7% to $0.64 per share. Over the past several years we have made significant transformations in our business, addressing many of the fundamental business processes throughout the organization. From 2000 to 2003, we reduced our cost structure and strengthened our balance sheet in order to deliver long term results to our shareholders and also to make Ryder more competitive in the marketplace. During 2004, we were successful in growing revenue in our transactional businesses and through strategic acquisitions in our FMS business. During 2005, we continued this transformation by demonstrating profitable growth in each of our three business segments and realizing record earnings for the second consecutive year. In 2006, targeted plans for driving growth across all product lines while continuing to demonstrate earnings leverage include: focus on strong customer retention and new business development; accelerate growth in FMS full service lease and contract maintenance product lines; continue growth in SCS, DCC and FMS commercial rental product lines; continue emphasis on prudent capital allocation manage capital over replacement cycle; utilize balance sheet capacity to replenish fleet and support growth objectives; and sustain focus on cost management and process improvements, while investing in sales and operational capabilities. ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY BETWEEN PERIODS Accounting Changes As discussed in Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, effective December 31, 2005, Ryder adopted Financial Accounting Standards Boards Interpretation No. (FIN) 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. The adoption of FIN 47 required us to record an asset retirement obligation related to the future removal of underground storage tanks located at our maintenance facilities. We recognized a cumulative effect charge upon adoption of 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) $2 million on an after tax basis, or $0.04 per diluted common share. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to significantly impact future results. As discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, effective July 1, 2003, Ryder consolidated three variable interest entities (VIEs) in connection with the adoption of FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, (as revised by FIN 46 R issued December 2003). The consolidated VIEs were established as part of previous sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment in which Ryder sold revenue earning equipment to special purpose entities and then leased the revenue earning equipment back as lessee under operating lease arrangements. In connection with the sale leaseback transactions executed in the form of vehicle securitizations and a synthetic leasing arrangement, we provided credit enhancements and residual value guarantees that obligated Ryder to absorb the majority of the expected losses from such entities, if any are realized. Therefore, FIN 46 required that these entities be consolidated. The consolidation of the VIEs did not have a significant impact on our consolidated net earnings; however, reported depreciation expense, equipment rental and interest expense were impacted by the consolidation of the VIEs. In addition, both net cash provided by operating activities and our free cash flow measure increased beginning July 2003 due to the add back of depreciation expense on the VIEs revenue earning equipment and net cash used in financing activities also increased due to principal payments on VIEs debt. We recognized a cumulative effect charge upon adoption of $3 million on an after tax basis, or $0.05 per diluted common share. FMS Acquisitions On March 1, 2004, we completed an asset purchase agreement with Ruan Leasing Company (Ruan) under which we acquired Ruans fleet of approximately 6,400 vehicles, 37 of its 111 service locations and more than 500 customers. Ryder also acquired full service contract maintenance agreements covering approximately 1,700 vehicles. Effective December 31, 2003, we also acquired substantially all the assets of General Car and Truck Leasing System (General), a major privately held commercial truck leasing, maintenance and rental company, including Generals fleet of approximately 4,200 vehicles, 15 of its 34 service locations and more than 700 customers. The combined networks operate under Ryders name and have allowed us to leverage our existing U.S. infrastructure in key markets while adding new infrastructure to strengthen our presence in targeted areas of the Midwest, Southeast, Mid Atlantic and Southwest. The results of these acquisitions have been included in the consolidated results of Ryder since the dates of acquisitions. 21 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. (2) Results included restructuring and other charges (recoveries), net of $2 million after tax, or $0.03 per diluted common share, in 2005 and $(11) million after tax, or $(0.17) per diluted common share, in 2004. See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges (Recoveries), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. (3) Net earnings for 2005 included (i) income from discontinued operations associated with the reduction of insurance reserves related to discontinued operations resulting in an after tax benefit of $2 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, and (ii) the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for costs associated with the future removal of underground storage tanks resulting in an after tax charge of $2 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share. Net earnings for 2003 included the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for (i) variable interest entities resulting in an after tax charge of $3 million, or $0.05 per diluted common share, and (ii) costs associated with eventual retirement of long lived assets primarily relating to components of revenue earning equipment resulting in an after tax charge of $1 million, or $0.02 per diluted common share. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased to $357 million in 2005 compared with $331 million in 2004, reflecting better FMS commercial rental results, higher gains on FMS used vehicle sales and reductions in operating expenses resulting from ongoing cost reduction activities and process improvement actions across all business segments, partially offset by the benefit from gains on the 2004 sale of our headquarters complex of $24 million. All business segments reported improved results. Earnings from continuing operations increased to $228 million in 2005 compared with $216 million in 2004. Earnings from continuing operations in 2005 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share, related to a change in Ohio income tax law. Earnings from continuing operations in 2004 benefited from after tax gains on the sale of our headquarters complex of $15 million, or $0.23 per diluted common share, and a net income tax benefit of $9 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share, associated with the resolution of various tax matters. Net earnings in 2005 included an after tax benefit of $2 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, related to discontinued operations and an after tax charge of $2 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share, for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the adoption of FIN 47. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes in 2004 increased to $331 million compared with $212 million in 2003. The earnings improvement in 2004 compared with 2003 was driven by the gain on sale of our headquarters complex, the positive impact of FMS acquisitions, increased FMS rental 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) pricing and utilization, higher gains on FMS used vehicle sales, lower pension costs, and reductions in operating expenses resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. See Operating Results by Business Segment for further discussion of operating results for the past three years. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Revenue: Fleet Management Solutions $ 3,921,191 3,602,839 3,231,675 9 % 11 Supply Chain Solutions 1,637,826 1,354,003 1,362,428 21 (1 ) Dedicated Contract Carriage 543,268 506,100 514,731 7 (2 ) Eliminations (361,438 ) (312,664 ) (306,540 ) (16 ) (2 ) Total $ 5,740,847 5,150,278 4,802,294 11 % 7 All business segments reported revenue growth in 2005. Additionally, revenue comparisons for all business segments were favorably impacted by pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs which increased fuel services revenue. FMS revenue was also positively impacted by higher rental revenue resulting from stronger pricing and increased contract related maintenance revenue from the implementation of growth initiatives. SCS revenue growth was primarily related to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. In addition, SCS and DCC revenue grew in 2005 due to new and expanded business. Revenue comparisons were also impacted by favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.9% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real. During 2004, FMS revenue was positively impacted by acquisitions and higher rental revenue resulting from a larger fleet, stronger pricing and increased activity. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Revenue comparisons were also impacted by increased FMS fuel services revenue primarily as a result of higher average fuel prices, and favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6% due to the strengthening of the British pound and the Canadian dollar. These increases were partially offset by reduced FMS full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) and the non renewal of certain customer contracts in our SCS and DCC business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at approximate fair value as if the sales were made to third parties. The increases in eliminations in 2005 and 2004 reflects the pass through of higher fuel costs from the FMS segment to SCS and DCC. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Operating expense (exclusive of items shown separately) $ 2,572,241 2,305,322 2,039,156 12 % 13 Percentage of revenue 45% 45% 42% Operating expense grew for 2005 and 2004 principally from higher fuel costs due to higher average fuel prices. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. The overall growth in revenue, excluding fuel, also 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contributed to the increases in operating expense in 2005 and 2004. For 2004, operating expense was also impacted by higher maintenance costs, resulting from a larger and older vehicle fleet, and added operating costs attributed to the FMS acquisitions. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $ 1,262,160 1,233,038 1,242,930 2 % (1 ) Percentage of revenue 22% 24% 26% Salaries and employee related costs grew for 2005 compared with 2004 as a result of headcount added to support the growth in our SCS business segment, which was offset slightly by reduced performance based incentive compensation and lower employee benefit costs. Average headcount increased 2% in 2005 compared with 2004. The number of employees at December 31, 2005 increased 6% to approximately 27,800, compared with 26,300 at December 31, 2004, primarily due to the growth in our SCS business segment. Pension expense decreased $4 million in 2005 to $59 million compared with 2004 and principally impacted FMS. The decrease in pension expense reflects the positive impact of higher actual pension asset returns in 2004. We expect pension expense on a pre tax basis to increase approximately $9 million to $68 million in 2006. Our 2006 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. The anticipated increase in pension expense would primarily impact our FMS business segment. Salaries and employee related costs decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as a result of lower pension expense and lower headcount in our SCS and DCC business segments caused by the non renewal of certain contracts, offset in part by higher performance based incentive compensation. Average headcount decreased 1% in 2004 compared with 2003. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $ 638,319 424,991 414,284 50 % 3 Percentage of revenue 11% 8% 9% Subcontracted transportation represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. During 2005, subcontracted transportation expense in our SCS business segment grew due to increased volumes of freight management activity from new and expanded business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs, resulting from increased fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation expense increased in 2004 compared with 2003 principally as a result of added transportation management based business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs resulting from increased fuel costs. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $ 740,415 706,028 624,580 5 % 13 Gains on vehicle sales, net (47,098 ) (34,504 ) (15,780 ) 37 119 Equipment rental 102,816 108,468 200,868 (5 ) (46 ) 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. The growth in depreciation expense during 2005 is due to higher vehicle replacement activity within our truck and tractor fleets as well as the conversion of leased vehicles to owned status, partially offset by a decline in our average trailer fleet size. The growth in depreciation expense during 2004 reflected the consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003 (approximately $40 million), the impact of vehicles added as part of the FMS acquisitions, the conversion of leased units to owned status as a result of lease extensions and the replacement of expiring leased units with owned units. The improvements in gains on vehicle sales in 2005 and 2004 were due to an increase in the number of units sold combined with improved average pricing on vehicles sold over the preceding periods. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in losses on sales. Equipment rental primarily consists of rental costs on revenue earning equipment in FMS. The decrease in equipment rental in 2005 from 2004 is due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles when compared with 2004. The significant decrease in 2004 compared with 2003 was due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles (compared with owned) resulting from the consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003 (approximately $50 million), the conversion of leased units to owned status as a result of lease extensions and the replacement of expiring leased units with owned units. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $ 120,474 100,114 96,169 20% 4 Effective interest rate 5.6% 5.5% 5.8% Interest expense grew in 2005 reflecting higher average debt levels, resulting from increased capital spending, income tax payments and share repurchases. The growth in interest expense in 2004 over 2003 reflects higher average debt levels, including debt of consolidated VIEs. Excluding interest expense from consolidated VIEs, comparisons for 2004 were favorably impacted by overall lower market interest rates and reduced effective interest rates as a result of hedging transactions, which principally benefited FMS. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Miscellaneous income, net $ (8,944 ) (6,625 ) (12,158 ) 35% (46 ) Miscellaneous income, net consists of investment income on securities used to fund certain benefit plans, interest income and other non operating items. Prior to the consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003, miscellaneous income, net also included servicing fee income for administrative services provided to vehicle lease trusts in connection with vehicle securitization transactions. Miscellaneous income, net increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to the one time recovery of $3 million for project costs incurred in prior years and better market performance of investments classified as trading securities used to fund certain benefit plans. Miscellaneous income, net decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 because of 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the elimination of servicing fee income related to certain VIEs. As a result of consolidating the vehicle securitization trusts, we no longer recognize service fee income. Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Restructuring and other charges (recoveries), net $ 3,376 (17,676 ) (230 ) 2005 Activity During 2005, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other charges of $3 million that consisted of employee severance and benefits, contract termination costs, and closure of leased facilities partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter and related primarily to the restructuring of our U.K. operations, and the offshoring of some administrative finance and support functions that will allow for future cost savings. We expect to realize annual pre tax cost savings of approximately $7 million from the 2005 fourth quarter actions, which are expected to be completed in the second half of 2006. During 2005, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 160 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in Ryders domestic and international FMS and SCS business segments and Central Support Services (CSS). The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $3 million. Cost reductions associated with these actions will benefit salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Many of the eliminated positions in our domestic operations were impacted by Ryders decision to outsource certain administrative finance functions to lower cost foreign providers and maximize our technology resources. Transition actions will begin in February 2006 and continue through the remainder of 2006. We also closed two administrative offices in the U.S. as a result of the restructuring of our FMS domestic business operations and recorded a charge for future cash payments related to lease obligations. As part of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions, Ryder management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced telecommunication services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 2010. In accordance with the terms of the services agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling nearly $1 million for contract termination costs. The transition activities are expected to be completed in the first half of 2006 and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services will benefit operating expenses starting in the latter part of 2006. These charges were partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals due to refinements in estimates. 2004 Activity During 2004, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other recoveries of $18 million that consisted of gains from the sale of the previous headquarters complex and reversals of severance and employee related accruals partially offset by contract termination costs. During 2004, we recognized $24 million in gains from properties sold in connection with the relocation of our headquarters. In May 2004, we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters facility for $39 million in cash and recognized a $22 million gain from the sale. In conjunction with this sale, we entered into a lease agreement with the purchaser to lease back the headquarters facility until we relocated to our new headquarters in April 2005. Also during 2004, we recognized gains totaling $2 million from the sale of properties ancillary to our main headquarters facility. In 2004, as part of ongoing cost containment initiatives, Ryder management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced information technology infrastructure services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2010. In accordance with the terms of the services agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling $8 million for contract termination ($6 million) and transition costs incurred since termination ($2 million). By December 31, 2004, all transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses starting in 2005. 2003 Activity During 2003, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 140 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in Ryders FMS and SCS business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $6 million. While many of these employees had not been terminated by December 31, 2003, such actions were substantially finalized by March 31, 2004. Estimated annual pre tax cost savings in salaries and employee related costs realized from these actions approximate $11 million. These charges were offset by reversals of severance and employee related accruals totaling $1 million due to refinements in estimates, recovery of $4 million from the settlement of a commercial dispute pertaining to prior billings with an information technology vendor and gains of $1 million on sales of owned facilities identified for closure in prior restructuring charges. See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges (Recoveries), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Provision for income taxes $ 129,460 115,513 76,916 12 % 50 Effective tax rate 36.3% 34.9% 36.2% The 2005 effective tax rate includes a tax benefit of $8 million associated with the State of Ohio enacted tax legislation, which phases out the Ohio corporate franchise (income) tax and phases in a new gross receipts tax called the Commercial Activity Tax (CAT) over a five year period. While the corporate franchise (income) tax was generally based on federal taxable income, the CAT is based on current year sales and rentals in Ohio. As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the elimination of Ohios corporate franchise (income) tax over the next five years resulted in a favorable adjustment to deferred income taxes. The 2004 effective tax rate includes a net tax benefit of $9 million associated with the completion of the audit of our federal income tax returns for the 1995 to 1997 period, partially offset by provisions made for loss contingencies related to the 1998 through 2000 period. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS represents those costs incurred to support all of our business segments, including sales and marketing, human resources, finance, corporate services, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each of our business segments and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, corporate communications, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at approximate fair value as if the transactions were made with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) is included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer, and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2005 versus 2004 Total revenue grew in 2005 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue for 2005 increased as a result of higher commercial rental and contract related maintenance revenue and the impact of acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $21 million of total additional revenue in 2005. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2005 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.6%. Full service lease revenue increased in 2005 primarily from the acquisition completed in March 2004 and growth in Canada as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) acquisitions) in the first half of 2005. Our U.S. business showed improved revenue growth trends in the second half of 2005 as a result of positive net sales. In 2006, we expect growth in full service lease revenue due to recent sales activity and improving retention results. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we also restructured our FMS operations to better service customers and drive future growth in full service lease. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue, which generally represents ancillary services supporting core product lines, benefited from ongoing initiatives aimed at growing these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of stronger pricing and revenue contributions attributed to the acquisition completed in March 2004. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue to improve in 2006 based on improved pricing discipline. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates approximately 85% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 296,435 292,241 252,968 1% 16 Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 284,187 257,828 206,653 10% 25 Average commercial rental fleet size(2) 36,500 36,000 32,800 1% 10 Average commercial rental power fleet size (2),(3) 26,100 25,000 22,900 4% 9 Commercial rental utilization 74.6% 76.9% 72.1% (230) bps 480 bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT grew $42 million in 2005 as a result of improved commercial rental results from higher pricing, higher gains on disposal of used vehicles resulting from stronger volume and pricing, and lower overhead costs, including performance based incentive compensation. 2004 versus 2003 Total revenue grew in 2004 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices and higher volumes attributed to acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $177 million of revenue in 2004. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2004 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. Full service lease revenue increased in 2004 primarily from acquisitions that added approximately 7,000 vehicles to our lease fleet. Comparisons were also favorably impacted by higher revenue in Canada and the U.K. as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) as a result of weak leasing demand in 2003 and flat net sales in 2004. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue increased due to initiatives implemented to drive growth in these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of higher rental pricing and utilization in each of our markets and a 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) larger fleet size. Commercial rental revenue in 2004 also benefited from revenue contributions attributed to acquisitions. FMS NBT grew $118 million in 2004 as a result of the acquisitions that allowed us to leverage our existing infrastructure, improved commercial rental results from higher rental pricing and utilization, higher gains on disposal of used revenue earning equipment from stronger pricing and volume, and lower pension costs. The impact of these items was partially offset by lower full service lease and contract maintenance revenue in our base business (excluding acquired contracts). Our global fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment and contract maintenance vehicles is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ Number of Units 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 End of period count By type: Trucks 63,200 63,700 62,400 (1 )% 2 Tractors 52,700 51,700 48,900 2 6 Trailers 40,600 43,100 43,200 (6 ) Other 5,800 5,900 5,700 (2 ) 4 Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 By product line: Full service lease 118,400 119,700 118,900 (1 )% 1 Commercial rental 40,500 41,700 38,500 (3 ) 8 Service and other vehicles 3,400 3,000 2,800 13 7 Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 Owned(1) 156,500 157,000 150,200 % 5 Leased 5,800 7,400 10,000 (22 ) (26 ) Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 Full year average 164,900 164,300 160,000 % 3 Customer vehicles under contract maintenance (end of period) 26,400 28,500 29,000 (7 )% (2 ) (1) Effective March 1, 2004, approximately 6,400 units were added to the fleet as part of the Ruan acquisition. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. NLE units represent vehicles held for sale, as well as vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. These vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to the higher level of lease vehicle replacement and increased out servicing activity of rental vehicles. In 2006, we expect the number of NLE units to remain at the current levels.

Subcontracted transportation is deducted from total revenue to arrive at our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was primarily due to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation, is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2005, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect revenue improvements to continue over the near term. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of the year. 2004 versus 2003 SCS total revenue and operating revenue declined in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain U.S. and international customer contracts. Additionally, international operating revenue in 2003 included $21 million associated with an inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. The unfavorable operating revenue comparisons were partially offset by new contract start ups and expansions in the U.S., Canada and Latin America and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Both SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. In 2004, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 30% of SCS total revenue and 19% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT declined $3 million in 2004 primarily due to lower operating revenue partially offset by reduced overhead spending resulting from continued profit improvement actions. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is deducted from total revenue to arrive at our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 DCC total and operating revenue decreased in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain customer contracts, partially offset by the pass through of higher average fuel prices. DCC NBT declined $6 million in 2004 as a result of lower revenue, increased driver costs and higher safety and insurance expenses, partially offset by lower overhead spending. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarters facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarters relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. We expect reductions in CSS spending levels over the near term based on continuing cost containment and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 Total CSS costs decreased in 2004 as a result of ongoing cost containment and process improvement actions, most notably in information technology (IT). This decrease was partially offset by higher performance based incentive compensation costs attributed to the improved overall performance. Technology costs were lower in 2004 due primarily to reduced pricing on purchased IT services. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2004 largely due to Sarbanes Oxley compliance costs that were not allocated to the business segments and higher performance based incentive compensation. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Financing activities 241,505 (195,760 ) (232,796 ) Investing activities (988,855 ) (720,113 ) (543,165 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (3,956 ) 9,368 8,738 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 27,756 (39,656 ) 36,390 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to improved operating performance and the add back of depreciation expense attributed to VIEs that were consolidated effective July 1, 2003. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Cash used in financing activities decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher debt borrowings and proceeds from stock option exercises were partially offset by increased stock repurchases. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher capital expenditures, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. Cash used in investing activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due to higher capital expenditures and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions. Capital expenditures increased in 2004 due to planned higher levels of vehicle replacements for equipment under lease to our customers and new lease sales. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions completed during 2004. We manage our business to maximize operating cash flows and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities as free cash flow. Although free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure, we consider it to be an important measure of comparative operating performance. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Collections on direct finance leases 70,408 63,795 61,368 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,963 42,839 13,392 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,752 288,674 196,198 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 13,181 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) (734,509 ) Acquisitions (15,110 ) (148,791 ) (96,518 ) Other, net 21,511 6,995 3,723 Free cash flow $ (209,793 ) 146,736 260,448 We used $210 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $147 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) offset by lower acquisition spending. Free cash flow decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher capital spending and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions offset better operating performance, higher proceeds from sales of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions. Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow comparisons in the first half of 2004 were also positively impacted by the add back of depreciation expense of approximately $40 million attributed to VIEs that were consolidated as a result of the adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. We anticipate negative free cash flow levels to improve in 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower income tax payments. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,082,332 862,994 459,239 Commercial rental 251,278 241,858 219,880 1,333,610 1,104,852 679,119 Operating property and equipment 77,360 59,767 46,011 Total capital expenditures 1,410,970 1,164,619 725,130 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (11,591 ) (72,461 ) 9,379 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,399,379 1,092,158 734,509 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $0.4 million, $54 million and $67 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures grew in 2005 and 2004 due primarily to increased replacement activity in our full service lease business. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels should be relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. As a result of our fleet age and anticipated higher levels of new sales and replacement activity, total capital expenditures are anticipated to increase to approximately $1.6 billion in 2006, including lease vehicle replacements of approximately $1.1 billion and spending for anticipated incremental lease growth of approximately $200 million. We expect to fund 2006 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In both 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Ryder completed two acquisitions related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $15 million in 2005, $149 million in 2004 and $97 million in 2003. Approximately $4 million is due to the sellers at December 31, 2005 and will be paid subject to holdback 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2006. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 1,783,216 1,815,900 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 188,271 79,033 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 600,000 135,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 162,124 147,153 Retirement of debentures (200,000 ) (72,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (343,933 ) (384,932 ) 406,462 (95,746 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (4,152 ) (9,380 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 433 54,094 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (593 ) 18,348 Total changes in debt 402,150 (32,684 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 32% at December 31, 2005, compared with 37% at December 31, 2004. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2005 Equity 2004 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,185,366 143% $ 1,783,216 118% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 117,062 161,138 Total obligations $ 2,302,428 151% $ 1,944,354 129% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total shareholders equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total shareholders equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess Ryders overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2005 was driven by our increased funding needs as a result of higher vehicle capital spending requirements, higher income tax payments and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A downgrade of Ryders debt rating below investment grade level would limit our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2005 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility is used primarily to finance working capital internationally and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. The credit facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no facility supported letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. During May 2005, the terms of the credit facility were amended thereby extending the expiration of the facility one year to 2010 and reducing the current annual facility fee from 15.0 basis points to 11.0 basis points. The annual facility fee applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2005 was 128%. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, we repaid $200 million of debentures. In September 2005, Ryder filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that were carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. The universal shelf registration statement became effective in November 2005. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) December 31, 2005, Ryder had $800 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder System, Inc., entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is similar to Ryders previous accounts receivable facility, which expired in December 2004, except that this program will be a 364 day facility. This program will be accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which would cause early termination, the program will expire on September 12, 2006, unless extended by the parties. At December 31, 2005, no receivables were sold pursuant to the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2005, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 474 Shelf registration statement 800 Trade receivables facility 200 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans and insurance companies) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be VIEs. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale and operating leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from such sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. These leases contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We did not enter into any sale and operating leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2003. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $16 million and $26 million, respectively, and we have accrued $3 million as a corresponding liability. See Note 17, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2005: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 268,716 438,880 865,837 610,113 2,183,546 Capital lease obligations 722 871 171 56 1,820 Total debt 269,438 439,751 866,008 610,169 2,185,366 Interest on debt(1) 113,332 174,251 120,934 223,016 631,533 Operating leases(2) 102,474 132,255 62,538 66,067 363,334 Purchase obligations(3) 28,794 33,543 8,975 71,312 Total contractual cash obligations 244,600 340,049 192,447 289,083 1,066,179 Insurance obligations(4) 111,163 99,107 40,156 52,814 303,240 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 13,115 1,001 17,104 31,220 Total $ 625,201 892,022 1,099,612 969,170 3,586,005 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2005. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to information technology services. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were derivative contracts, deferred compensation obligations and legal contractual obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2006, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $71 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2006 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $115 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In connection with the accrual of the additional minimum pension liability, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $221 million and $189 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which increased at December 31, 2005 as reductions in discount rates offset the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 7% in 2005. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may, from time to time, make voluntary contributions to our pension plans. During 2005, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $12 million compared with $70 million in 2004. After considering the 2005 contributions, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $115 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. Share Repurchases and Cash Dividends In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. At December 31, 2005, we had repurchased and retired approximately 2.6 million shares under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $109 million. Management has established a prearranged written plan under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allows for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We expect to complete the October 2005 program in the first quarter of 2006. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through employee stock purchase plans since May 1, 2004, which totaled approximately 2.4 million shares at December 31, 2005. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan under Rule 10b5 1 as part of the July 2004 program. In 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate, in part, the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003 up to $90 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the 2003 program. In 2004 and 2003, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million and 117,500 shares, respectively, under the 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million and $3 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $41 million in 2005, $39 million in 2004 and $38 million in 2003. During 2005, we increased our annual dividend to $0.64 per share of common stock. In February 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.16 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2005. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 16, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.5 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement totaled $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% and a fair value of $1.2 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2004 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $13 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements totaled $0.8 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $607 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $285 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2004 totaled $5 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2006 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $10 million and $16 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.1 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $9 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2005, we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004 and $1 million in 2003. We incurred environmental expenses of $9 million, $10 million and $12 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2005 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2005, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2006, which will cause depreciation expense in 2006 to decrease by approximately $13 million compared with 2005. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2006 by approximately $85 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2005, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $5 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2006 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 76% equity securities and 24% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an unrecognized loss of $428 million at the end of 2005 compared with a loss of $371 million at the end of 2004. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2005 results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and assets earning a rate of return below the assumed rates offset in part by the amortization of the opening balance. To the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. The amount of the unrecognized loss subject to amortization in 2006 will be $281 million. The effect on years beyond 2006 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2005 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2006 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2006 Net December 31, 2005 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.90% + 0.25% $5 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.90% 0.25% + $5 million + $41 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $2 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2005, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2006 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2005, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $156 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, in certain instances (typically when we manage transportation for our customers), we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis. In transportation management contracts where we act as an agent, we have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. In addition, we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments. During 2005, we entered into a significant SCS managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as principal in the arrangement. As a result, we recognized an additional $135 million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in 2005 by reporting revenue on a gross basis. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $235 million and $257 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. The amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at December 31, 2004 and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Share Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of SFAS No. 123R would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax benefits and headquarters complex sale. We believe that the comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Net earnings were $227 million, up 5% from $216 million in 2004. o Net earnings for 2005 included (i) income from discontinued operations associated with the reduction of insurance reserves related to discontinued operations resulting in an after tax benefit of $2 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, and (ii) the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for costs associated with the future removal of underground storage tanks resulting in an after tax charge of $2 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share. All business segments contributed to the strong results. The earnings growth was driven primarily by improved FMS commercial rental performance, higher gains on FMS used vehicle sales and reductions in operating expenses resulting from ongoing cost reduction activities and process improvement actions across all business segments. Capital expenditures increased to $1.41 billion compared with $1.16 billion in 2004. The increase in capital spending reflects higher vehicle replacements primarily related to the FMS lease product line. Our debt to equity ratio increased to 143% from 118% in 2004. Total obligations (including off balance sheet debt) to equity ratio increased to 151% from 129% in 2004. The increases in leverage ratios were driven by our increased funding requirements as a result of higher vehicle capital spending, higher income tax payments and stock repurchases. We repurchased a total of 3.7 million shares of common stock in 2005 for $152 million. We also increased our annual dividend by 7% to $0.64 per share. Over the past several years we have made significant transformations in our business, addressing many of the fundamental business processes throughout the organization. From 2000 to 2003, we reduced our cost structure and strengthened our balance sheet in order to deliver long term results to our shareholders and also to make Ryder more competitive in the marketplace. During 2004, we were successful in growing revenue in our transactional businesses and through strategic acquisitions in our FMS business. During 2005, we continued this transformation by demonstrating profitable growth in each of our three business segments and realizing record earnings for the second consecutive year. In 2006, targeted plans for driving growth across all product lines while continuing to demonstrate earnings leverage include: focus on strong customer retention and new business development; accelerate growth in FMS full service lease and contract maintenance product lines; continue growth in SCS, DCC and FMS commercial rental product lines; continue emphasis on prudent capital allocation manage capital over replacement cycle; utilize balance sheet capacity to replenish fleet and support growth objectives; and sustain focus on cost management and process improvements, while investing in sales and operational capabilities. ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY BETWEEN PERIODS Accounting Changes As discussed in Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, effective December 31, 2005, Ryder adopted Financial Accounting Standards Boards Interpretation No. (FIN) 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. The adoption of FIN 47 required us to record an asset retirement obligation related to the future removal of underground storage tanks located at our maintenance facilities. We recognized a cumulative effect charge upon adoption of 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) $2 million on an after tax basis, or $0.04 per diluted common share. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to significantly impact future results. As discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, effective July 1, 2003, Ryder consolidated three variable interest entities (VIEs) in connection with the adoption of FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, (as revised by FIN 46 R issued December 2003). The consolidated VIEs were established as part of previous sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment in which Ryder sold revenue earning equipment to special purpose entities and then leased the revenue earning equipment back as lessee under operating lease arrangements. In connection with the sale leaseback transactions executed in the form of vehicle securitizations and a synthetic leasing arrangement, we provided credit enhancements and residual value guarantees that obligated Ryder to absorb the majority of the expected losses from such entities, if any are realized. Therefore, FIN 46 required that these entities be consolidated. The consolidation of the VIEs did not have a significant impact on our consolidated net earnings; however, reported depreciation expense, equipment rental and interest expense were impacted by the consolidation of the VIEs. In addition, both net cash provided by operating activities and our free cash flow measure increased beginning July 2003 due to the add back of depreciation expense on the VIEs revenue earning equipment and net cash used in financing activities also increased due to principal payments on VIEs debt. We recognized a cumulative effect charge upon adoption of $3 million on an after tax basis, or $0.05 per diluted common share. FMS Acquisitions On March 1, 2004, we completed an asset purchase agreement with Ruan Leasing Company (Ruan) under which we acquired Ruans fleet of approximately 6,400 vehicles, 37 of its 111 service locations and more than 500 customers. Ryder also acquired full service contract maintenance agreements covering approximately 1,700 vehicles. Effective December 31, 2003, we also acquired substantially all the assets of General Car and Truck Leasing System (General), a major privately held commercial truck leasing, maintenance and rental company, including Generals fleet of approximately 4,200 vehicles, 15 of its 34 service locations and more than 700 customers. The combined networks operate under Ryders name and have allowed us to leverage our existing U.S. infrastructure in key markets while adding new infrastructure to strengthen our presence in targeted areas of the Midwest, Southeast, Mid Atlantic and Southwest. The results of these acquisitions have been included in the consolidated results of Ryder since the dates of acquisitions. 21 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. (2) Results included restructuring and other charges (recoveries), net of $2 million after tax, or $0.03 per diluted common share, in 2005 and $(11) million after tax, or $(0.17) per diluted common share, in 2004. See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges (Recoveries), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. (3) Net earnings for 2005 included (i) income from discontinued operations associated with the reduction of insurance reserves related to discontinued operations resulting in an after tax benefit of $2 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, and (ii) the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for costs associated with the future removal of underground storage tanks resulting in an after tax charge of $2 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share. Net earnings for 2003 included the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for (i) variable interest entities resulting in an after tax charge of $3 million, or $0.05 per diluted common share, and (ii) costs associated with eventual retirement of long lived assets primarily relating to components of revenue earning equipment resulting in an after tax charge of $1 million, or $0.02 per diluted common share. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased to $357 million in 2005 compared with $331 million in 2004, reflecting better FMS commercial rental results, higher gains on FMS used vehicle sales and reductions in operating expenses resulting from ongoing cost reduction activities and process improvement actions across all business segments, partially offset by the benefit from gains on the 2004 sale of our headquarters complex of $24 million. All business segments reported improved results. Earnings from continuing operations increased to $228 million in 2005 compared with $216 million in 2004. Earnings from continuing operations in 2005 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share, related to a change in Ohio income tax law. Earnings from continuing operations in 2004 benefited from after tax gains on the sale of our headquarters complex of $15 million, or $0.23 per diluted common share, and a net income tax benefit of $9 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share, associated with the resolution of various tax matters. Net earnings in 2005 included an after tax benefit of $2 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, related to discontinued operations and an after tax charge of $2 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share, for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the adoption of FIN 47. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes in 2004 increased to $331 million compared with $212 million in 2003. The earnings improvement in 2004 compared with 2003 was driven by the gain on sale of our headquarters complex, the positive impact of FMS acquisitions, increased FMS rental 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) pricing and utilization, higher gains on FMS used vehicle sales, lower pension costs, and reductions in operating expenses resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. See Operating Results by Business Segment for further discussion of operating results for the past three years.

Additionally, revenue comparisons for all business segments were favorably impacted by pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs which increased fuel services revenue. FMS revenue was also positively impacted by higher rental revenue resulting from stronger pricing and increased contract related maintenance revenue from the implementation of growth initiatives. SCS revenue growth was primarily related to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. In addition, SCS and DCC revenue grew in 2005 due to new and expanded business. Revenue comparisons were also impacted by favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.9% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real. During 2004, FMS revenue was positively impacted by acquisitions and higher rental revenue resulting from a larger fleet, stronger pricing and increased activity. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Revenue comparisons were also impacted by increased FMS fuel services revenue primarily as a result of higher average fuel prices, and favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6% due to the strengthening of the British pound and the Canadian dollar. These increases were partially offset by reduced FMS full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) and the non renewal of certain customer contracts in our SCS and DCC business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at approximate fair value as if the sales were made to third parties. The increases in eliminations in 2005 and 2004 reflects the pass through of higher fuel costs from the FMS segment to SCS and DCC. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Operating expense (exclusive of items shown separately) $ 2,572,241 2,305,322 2,039,156 12 % 13 Percentage of revenue 45% 45% 42% Operating expense grew for 2005 and 2004 principally from higher fuel costs due to higher average fuel prices. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. The overall growth in revenue, excluding fuel, also 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contributed to the increases in operating expense in 2005 and 2004. For 2004, operating expense was also impacted by higher maintenance costs, resulting from a larger and older vehicle fleet, and added operating costs attributed to the FMS acquisitions. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $ 1,262,160 1,233,038 1,242,930 2 % (1 ) Percentage of revenue 22% 24% 26% Salaries and employee related costs grew for 2005 compared with 2004 as a result of headcount added to support the growth in our SCS business segment, which was offset slightly by reduced performance based incentive compensation and lower employee benefit costs. Average headcount increased 2% in 2005 compared with 2004. The number of employees at December 31, 2005 increased 6% to approximately 27,800, compared with 26,300 at December 31, 2004, primarily due to the growth in our SCS business segment. Pension expense decreased $4 million in 2005 to $59 million compared with 2004 and principally impacted FMS. The decrease in pension expense reflects the positive impact of higher actual pension asset returns in 2004. We expect pension expense on a pre tax basis to increase approximately $9 million to $68 million in 2006. Our 2006 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. The anticipated increase in pension expense would primarily impact our FMS business segment. Salaries and employee related costs decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as a result of lower pension expense and lower headcount in our SCS and DCC business segments caused by the non renewal of certain contracts, offset in part by higher performance based incentive compensation. Average headcount decreased 1% in 2004 compared with 2003. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $ 638,319 424,991 414,284 50 % 3 Percentage of revenue 11% 8% 9% Subcontracted transportation represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. During 2005, subcontracted transportation expense in our SCS business segment grew due to increased volumes of freight management activity from new and expanded business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs, resulting from increased fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation expense increased in 2004 compared with 2003 principally as a result of added transportation management based business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs resulting from increased fuel costs. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $ 740,415 706,028 624,580 5 % 13 Gains on vehicle sales, net (47,098 ) (34,504 ) (15,780 ) 37 119 Equipment rental 102,816 108,468 200,868 (5 ) (46 ) 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. The growth in depreciation expense during 2005 is due to higher vehicle replacement activity within our truck and tractor fleets as well as the conversion of leased vehicles to owned status, partially offset by a decline in our average trailer fleet size. The growth in depreciation expense during 2004 reflected the consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003 (approximately $40 million), the impact of vehicles added as part of the FMS acquisitions, the conversion of leased units to owned status as a result of lease extensions and the replacement of expiring leased units with owned units. The improvements in gains on vehicle sales in 2005 and 2004 were due to an increase in the number of units sold combined with improved average pricing on vehicles sold over the preceding periods. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in losses on sales. Equipment rental primarily consists of rental costs on revenue earning equipment in FMS. The decrease in equipment rental in 2005 from 2004 is due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles when compared with 2004. The significant decrease in 2004 compared with 2003 was due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles (compared with owned) resulting from the consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003 (approximately $50 million), the conversion of leased units to owned status as a result of lease extensions and the replacement of expiring leased units with owned units.

The growth in interest expense in 2004 over 2003 reflects higher average debt levels, including debt of consolidated VIEs. Excluding interest expense from consolidated VIEs, comparisons for 2004 were favorably impacted by overall lower market interest rates and reduced effective interest rates as a result of hedging transactions, which principally benefited FMS.

Miscellaneous income, net increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to the one time recovery of $3 million for project costs incurred in prior years and better market performance of investments classified as trading securities used to fund certain benefit plans. Miscellaneous income, net decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 because of 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the elimination of servicing fee income related to certain VIEs. As a result of consolidating the vehicle securitization trusts, we no longer recognize service fee income. Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Restructuring and other charges (recoveries), net $ 3,376 (17,676 ) (230 ) 2005 Activity During 2005, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other charges of $3 million that consisted of employee severance and benefits, contract termination costs, and closure of leased facilities partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter and related primarily to the restructuring of our U.K. operations, and the offshoring of some administrative finance and support functions that will allow for future cost savings. We expect to realize annual pre tax cost savings of approximately $7 million from the 2005 fourth quarter actions, which are expected to be completed in the second half of 2006. During 2005, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 160 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in Ryders domestic and international FMS and SCS business segments and Central Support Services (CSS). The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $3 million. Cost reductions associated with these actions will benefit salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Many of the eliminated positions in our domestic operations were impacted by Ryders decision to outsource certain administrative finance functions to lower cost foreign providers and maximize our technology resources. Transition actions will begin in February 2006 and continue through the remainder of 2006. We also closed two administrative offices in the U.S. as a result of the restructuring of our FMS domestic business operations and recorded a charge for future cash payments related to lease obligations. As part of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions, Ryder management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced telecommunication services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 2010. In accordance with the terms of the services agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling nearly $1 million for contract termination costs. The transition activities are expected to be completed in the first half of 2006 and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services will benefit operating expenses starting in the latter part of 2006. These charges were partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals due to refinements in estimates. 2004 Activity During 2004, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other recoveries of $18 million that consisted of gains from the sale of the previous headquarters complex and reversals of severance and employee related accruals partially offset by contract termination costs. During 2004, we recognized $24 million in gains from properties sold in connection with the relocation of our headquarters. In May 2004, we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters facility for $39 million in cash and recognized a $22 million gain from the sale. In conjunction with this sale, we entered into a lease agreement with the purchaser to lease back the headquarters facility until we relocated to our new headquarters in April 2005. Also during 2004, we recognized gains totaling $2 million from the sale of properties ancillary to our main headquarters facility. In 2004, as part of ongoing cost containment initiatives, Ryder management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced information technology infrastructure services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2010. In accordance with the terms of the services agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling $8 million for contract termination ($6 million) and transition costs incurred since termination ($2 million). By December 31, 2004, all transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses starting in 2005. 2003 Activity During 2003, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 140 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in Ryders FMS and SCS business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $6 million. While many of these employees had not been terminated by December 31, 2003, such actions were substantially finalized by March 31, 2004. Estimated annual pre tax cost savings in salaries and employee related costs realized from these actions approximate $11 million. These charges were offset by reversals of severance and employee related accruals totaling $1 million due to refinements in estimates, recovery of $4 million from the settlement of a commercial dispute pertaining to prior billings with an information technology vendor and gains of $1 million on sales of owned facilities identified for closure in prior restructuring charges. See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges (Recoveries), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

While the corporate franchise (income) tax was generally based on federal taxable income, the CAT is based on current year sales and rentals in Ohio. As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the elimination of Ohios corporate franchise (income) tax over the next five years resulted in a favorable adjustment to deferred income taxes. The 2004 effective tax rate includes a net tax benefit of $9 million associated with the completion of the audit of our federal income tax returns for the 1995 to 1997 period, partially offset by provisions made for loss contingencies related to the 1998 through 2000 period.

CSS represents those costs incurred to support all of our business segments, including sales and marketing, human resources, finance, corporate services, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each of our business segments and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, corporate communications, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at approximate fair value as if the transactions were made with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) is included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer, and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2005 versus 2004 Total revenue grew in 2005 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue for 2005 increased as a result of higher commercial rental and contract related maintenance revenue and the impact of acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $21 million of total additional revenue in 2005. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2005 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.6%. Full service lease revenue increased in 2005 primarily from the acquisition completed in March 2004 and growth in Canada as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) acquisitions) in the first half of 2005. Our U.S. business showed improved revenue growth trends in the second half of 2005 as a result of positive net sales. In 2006, we expect growth in full service lease revenue due to recent sales activity and improving retention results. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we also restructured our FMS operations to better service customers and drive future growth in full service lease. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue, which generally represents ancillary services supporting core product lines, benefited from ongoing initiatives aimed at growing these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of stronger pricing and revenue contributions attributed to the acquisition completed in March 2004. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue to improve in 2006 based on improved pricing discipline. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates approximately 85% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 296,435 292,241 252,968 1% 16 Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 284,187 257,828 206,653 10% 25 Average commercial rental fleet size(2) 36,500 36,000 32,800 1% 10 Average commercial rental power fleet size (2),(3) 26,100 25,000 22,900 4% 9 Commercial rental utilization 74.6% 76.9% 72.1% (230) bps 480 bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT grew $42 million in 2005 as a result of improved commercial rental results from higher pricing, higher gains on disposal of used vehicles resulting from stronger volume and pricing, and lower overhead costs, including performance based incentive compensation. 2004 versus 2003 Total revenue grew in 2004 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices and higher volumes attributed to acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $177 million of revenue in 2004. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2004 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. Full service lease revenue increased in 2004 primarily from acquisitions that added approximately 7,000 vehicles to our lease fleet. Comparisons were also favorably impacted by higher revenue in Canada and the U.K. as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) as a result of weak leasing demand in 2003 and flat net sales in 2004. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue increased due to initiatives implemented to drive growth in these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of higher rental pricing and utilization in each of our markets and a 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) larger fleet size. Commercial rental revenue in 2004 also benefited from revenue contributions attributed to acquisitions. FMS NBT grew $118 million in 2004 as a result of the acquisitions that allowed us to leverage our existing infrastructure, improved commercial rental results from higher rental pricing and utilization, higher gains on disposal of used revenue earning equipment from stronger pricing and volume, and lower pension costs. The impact of these items was partially offset by lower full service lease and contract maintenance revenue in our base business (excluding acquired contracts). Our global fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment and contract maintenance vehicles is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ Number of Units 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 End of period count By type: Trucks 63,200 63,700 62,400 (1 )% 2 Tractors 52,700 51,700 48,900 2 6 Trailers 40,600 43,100 43,200 (6 ) Other 5,800 5,900 5,700 (2 ) 4 Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 By product line: Full service lease 118,400 119,700 118,900 (1 )% 1 Commercial rental 40,500 41,700 38,500 (3 ) 8 Service and other vehicles 3,400 3,000 2,800 13 7 Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 Owned(1) 156,500 157,000 150,200 % 5 Leased 5,800 7,400 10,000 (22 ) (26 ) Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 Full year average 164,900 164,300 160,000 % 3 Customer vehicles under contract maintenance (end of period) 26,400 28,500 29,000 (7 )% (2 ) (1) Effective March 1, 2004, approximately 6,400 units were added to the fleet as part of the Ruan acquisition. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. NLE units represent vehicles held for sale, as well as vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. These vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to the higher level of lease vehicle replacement and increased out servicing activity of rental vehicles. In 2006, we expect the number of NLE units to remain at the current levels.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was primarily due to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation, is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2005, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect revenue improvements to continue over the near term. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of the year. 2004 versus 2003 SCS total revenue and operating revenue declined in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain U.S. and international customer contracts. Additionally, international operating revenue in 2003 included $21 million associated with an inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. The unfavorable operating revenue comparisons were partially offset by new contract start ups and expansions in the U.S., Canada and Latin America and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Both SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. In 2004, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 30% of SCS total revenue and 19% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT declined $3 million in 2004 primarily due to lower operating revenue partially offset by reduced overhead spending resulting from continued profit improvement actions. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 DCC total and operating revenue decreased in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain customer contracts, partially offset by the pass through of higher average fuel prices. DCC NBT declined $6 million in 2004 as a result of lower revenue, increased driver costs and higher safety and insurance expenses, partially offset by lower overhead spending. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarters relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. We expect reductions in CSS spending levels over the near term based on continuing cost containment and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 Total CSS costs decreased in 2004 as a result of ongoing cost containment and process improvement actions, most notably in information technology (IT). This decrease was partially offset by higher performance based incentive compensation costs attributed to the improved overall performance. Technology costs were lower in 2004 due primarily to reduced pricing on purchased IT services. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2004 largely due to Sarbanes Oxley compliance costs that were not allocated to the business segments and higher performance based incentive compensation. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Financing activities 241,505 (195,760 ) (232,796 ) Investing activities (988,855 ) (720,113 ) (543,165 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (3,956 ) 9,368 8,738 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 27,756 (39,656 ) 36,390 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to improved operating performance and the add back of depreciation expense attributed to VIEs that were consolidated effective July 1, 2003. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Cash used in financing activities decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher debt borrowings and proceeds from stock option exercises were partially offset by increased stock repurchases. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher capital expenditures, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. Cash used in investing activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due to higher capital expenditures and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions. Capital expenditures increased in 2004 due to planned higher levels of vehicle replacements for equipment under lease to our customers and new lease sales. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions completed during 2004. We manage our business to maximize operating cash flows and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities as free cash flow. Although free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure, we consider it to be an important measure of comparative operating performance. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Collections on direct finance leases 70,408 63,795 61,368 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,963 42,839 13,392 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,752 288,674 196,198 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 13,181 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) (734,509 ) Acquisitions (15,110 ) (148,791 ) (96,518 ) Other, net 21,511 6,995 3,723 Free cash flow $ (209,793 ) 146,736 260,448 We used $210 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $147 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) offset by lower acquisition spending. Free cash flow decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher capital spending and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions offset better operating performance, higher proceeds from sales of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions. Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow comparisons in the first half of 2004 were also positively impacted by the add back of depreciation expense of approximately $40 million attributed to VIEs that were consolidated as a result of the adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. We anticipate negative free cash flow levels to improve in 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower income tax payments. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,082,332 862,994 459,239 Commercial rental 251,278 241,858 219,880 1,333,610 1,104,852 679,119 Operating property and equipment 77,360 59,767 46,011 Total capital expenditures 1,410,970 1,164,619 725,130 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (11,591 ) (72,461 ) 9,379 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,399,379 1,092,158 734,509 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $0.4 million, $54 million and $67 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures grew in 2005 and 2004 due primarily to increased replacement activity in our full service lease business. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels should be relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. As a result of our fleet age and anticipated higher levels of new sales and replacement activity, total capital expenditures are anticipated to increase to approximately $1.6 billion in 2006, including lease vehicle replacements of approximately $1.1 billion and spending for anticipated incremental lease growth of approximately $200 million. We expect to fund 2006 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In both 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Ryder completed two acquisitions related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $15 million in 2005, $149 million in 2004 and $97 million in 2003. Approximately $4 million is due to the sellers at December 31, 2005 and will be paid subject to holdback 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) provisions set forth in the purchase agreements. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2006. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 1,783,216 1,815,900 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 188,271 79,033 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 600,000 135,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 162,124 147,153 Retirement of debentures (200,000 ) (72,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (343,933 ) (384,932 ) 406,462 (95,746 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (4,152 ) (9,380 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 433 54,094 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (593 ) 18,348 Total changes in debt 402,150 (32,684 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 32% at December 31, 2005, compared with 37% at December 31, 2004. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2005 Equity 2004 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,185,366 143% $ 1,783,216 118% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 117,062 161,138 Total obligations $ 2,302,428 151% $ 1,944,354 129% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total shareholders equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total shareholders equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess Ryders overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2005 was driven by our increased funding needs as a result of higher vehicle capital spending requirements, higher income tax payments and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A downgrade of Ryders debt rating below investment grade level would limit our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2005 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility is used primarily to finance working capital internationally and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. The credit facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no facility supported letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. During May 2005, the terms of the credit facility were amended thereby extending the expiration of the facility one year to 2010 and reducing the current annual facility fee from 15.0 basis points to 11.0 basis points. The annual facility fee applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2005 was 128%. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, we repaid $200 million of debentures. In September 2005, Ryder filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that were carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. The universal shelf registration statement became effective in November 2005. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) December 31, 2005, Ryder had $800 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder System, Inc., entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is similar to Ryders previous accounts receivable facility, which expired in December 2004, except that this program will be a 364 day facility. This program will be accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which would cause early termination, the program will expire on September 12, 2006, unless extended by the parties. At December 31, 2005, no receivables were sold pursuant to the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2005, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 474 Shelf registration statement 800 Trade receivables facility 200 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans and insurance companies) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be VIEs. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale and operating leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from such sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. These leases contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We did not enter into any sale and operating leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2003. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $16 million and $26 million, respectively, and we have accrued $3 million as a corresponding liability. See Note 17, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2005: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 268,716 438,880 865,837 610,113 2,183,546 Capital lease obligations 722 871 171 56 1,820 Total debt 269,438 439,751 866,008 610,169 2,185,366 Interest on debt(1) 113,332 174,251 120,934 223,016 631,533 Operating leases(2) 102,474 132,255 62,538 66,067 363,334 Purchase obligations(3) 28,794 33,543 8,975 71,312 Total contractual cash obligations 244,600 340,049 192,447 289,083 1,066,179 Insurance obligations(4) 111,163 99,107 40,156 52,814 303,240 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 13,115 1,001 17,104 31,220 Total $ 625,201 892,022 1,099,612 969,170 3,586,005 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2005. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to information technology services. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were derivative contracts, deferred compensation obligations and legal contractual obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2006, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $71 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2006 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $115 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In connection with the accrual of the additional minimum pension liability, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $221 million and $189 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which increased at December 31, 2005 as reductions in discount rates offset the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 7% in 2005. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may, from time to time, make voluntary contributions to our pension plans. During 2005, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $12 million compared with $70 million in 2004. After considering the 2005 contributions, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $115 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. Share Repurchases and Cash Dividends In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. At December 31, 2005, we had repurchased and retired approximately 2.6 million shares under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $109 million. Management has established a prearranged written plan under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allows for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We expect to complete the October 2005 program in the first quarter of 2006. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through employee stock purchase plans since May 1, 2004, which totaled approximately 2.4 million shares at December 31, 2005. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan under Rule 10b5 1 as part of the July 2004 program. In 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate, in part, the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003 up to $90 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the 2003 program. In 2004 and 2003, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million and 117,500 shares, respectively, under the 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million and $3 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $41 million in 2005, $39 million in 2004 and $38 million in 2003. During 2005, we increased our annual dividend to $0.64 per share of common stock. In February 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.16 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2005. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 16, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.5 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement totaled $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% and a fair value of $1.2 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2004 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $13 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements totaled $0.8 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $607 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $285 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2004 totaled $5 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2006 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $10 million and $16 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.1 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $9 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2005, we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004 and $1 million in 2003. We incurred environmental expenses of $9 million, $10 million and $12 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2005 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2005, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2006, which will cause depreciation expense in 2006 to decrease by approximately $13 million compared with 2005. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2006 by approximately $85 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2005, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $5 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2006 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 76% equity securities and 24% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an unrecognized loss of $428 million at the end of 2005 compared with a loss of $371 million at the end of 2004. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2005 results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and assets earning a rate of return below the assumed rates offset in part by the amortization of the opening balance. To the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. The amount of the unrecognized loss subject to amortization in 2006 will be $281 million. The effect on years beyond 2006 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2005 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2006 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2006 Net December 31, 2005 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.90% + 0.25% $5 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.90% 0.25% + $5 million + $41 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $2 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2005, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2006 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2005, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $156 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, in certain instances (typically when we manage transportation for our customers), we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis. In transportation management contracts where we act as an agent, we have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. In addition, we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments. During 2005, we entered into a significant SCS managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as principal in the arrangement. As a result, we recognized an additional $135 million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in 2005 by reporting revenue on a gross basis. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $235 million and $257 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. The amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at December 31, 2004 and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Share Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of SFAS No. 123R would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax benefits and headquarters complex sale. We believe that the comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Forward looking statements (within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) are statements that relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends concerning matters that are not historical facts.

This Annual Report contains forward looking statements including, but not limited to, statements regarding: our expectations as to anticipated revenue and earnings growth across all business segments; our ability to improve our competitive advantage by leveraging our vehicle buying power, reducing vehicle downtime, providing innovative broad based supply chain solutions and increasing our customers competitive positions; anticipated gains on the sale of used vehicles; the impact of the restructuring activities and growth initiatives on our FMS business segment; our ability to successfully achieve the operational goals that are the basis of our business strategies, including offering competitive pricing, diversifying our customer base, optimizing asset utilization, leveraging the expertise of our various business segments, serving our customers global needs and expanding our support services; impact of losses from conditional obligations arising from guarantees; number of NLE vehicles in inventory over the near term; our belief as to the adequacy of our insurance coverages, funding sources and the effectiveness of our interest and foreign currency exchange rate risk management programs; our relationship with our employees; our belief that we can continue to realize significant savings from our cost management initiatives and process improvement actions, and that such initiatives and actions will mitigate pricing pressures from our SCS customers; estimates of free cash flow, leverage ratios and capital expenditures for 2006; 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the adequacy of our accounting estimates and reserves for pension expense, depreciation and residual value guarantees, self insurance reserves, goodwill impairment, accounting changes and income taxes, and the future impact of FIN 47; our belief that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in their audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period; our ability to fund all of our operations in 2006 through internally generated funds and outside funding sources; and the anticipated impact of fuel prices and cost of environmental liabilities. These statements, as well as other forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report, are based on our current plans and expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We caution readers that certain important factors could cause actual results and events to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward looking statements. For a detailed description of certain of these risk factors, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report. The risks included in this Annual Report are not exhaustive. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors or to assess the impact of such risk factors on our business. As a result, no assurance can be given as to our future results or achievements. You should not place undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report. We do not intend, or assume any obligation, to update or revise any forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) $2 million on an after tax basis, or $0.04 per diluted common share. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to significantly impact future results. As discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, effective July 1, 2003, Ryder consolidated three variable interest entities (VIEs) in connection with the adoption of FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, (as revised by FIN 46 R issued December 2003). The consolidated VIEs were established as part of previous sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment in which Ryder sold revenue earning equipment to special purpose entities and then leased the revenue earning equipment back as lessee under operating lease arrangements. In connection with the sale leaseback transactions executed in the form of vehicle securitizations and a synthetic leasing arrangement, we provided credit enhancements and residual value guarantees that obligated Ryder to absorb the majority of the expected losses from such entities, if any are realized. Therefore, FIN 46 required that these entities be consolidated. The consolidation of the VIEs did not have a significant impact on our consolidated net earnings; however, reported depreciation expense, equipment rental and interest expense were impacted by the consolidation of the VIEs. In addition, both net cash provided by operating activities and our free cash flow measure increased beginning July 2003 due to the add back of depreciation expense on the VIEs revenue earning equipment and net cash used in financing activities also increased due to principal payments on VIEs debt. We recognized a cumulative effect charge upon adoption of $3 million on an after tax basis, or $0.05 per diluted common share. FMS Acquisitions On March 1, 2004, we completed an asset purchase agreement with Ruan Leasing Company (Ruan) under which we acquired Ruans fleet of approximately 6,400 vehicles, 37 of its 111 service locations and more than 500 customers. Ryder also acquired full service contract maintenance agreements covering approximately 1,700 vehicles. Effective December 31, 2003, we also acquired substantially all the assets of General Car and Truck Leasing System (General), a major privately held commercial truck leasing, maintenance and rental company, including Generals fleet of approximately 4,200 vehicles, 15 of its 34 service locations and more than 700 customers. The combined networks operate under Ryders name and have allowed us to leverage our existing U.S. infrastructure in key markets while adding new infrastructure to strengthen our presence in targeted areas of the Midwest, Southeast, Mid Atlantic and Southwest. The results of these acquisitions have been included in the consolidated results of Ryder since the dates of acquisitions. 21 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. (2) Results included restructuring and other charges (recoveries), net of $2 million after tax, or $0.03 per diluted common share, in 2005 and $(11) million after tax, or $(0.17) per diluted common share, in 2004. See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges (Recoveries), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. (3) Net earnings for 2005 included (i) income from discontinued operations associated with the reduction of insurance reserves related to discontinued operations resulting in an after tax benefit of $2 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, and (ii) the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for costs associated with the future removal of underground storage tanks resulting in an after tax charge of $2 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share. Net earnings for 2003 included the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for (i) variable interest entities resulting in an after tax charge of $3 million, or $0.05 per diluted common share, and (ii) costs associated with eventual retirement of long lived assets primarily relating to components of revenue earning equipment resulting in an after tax charge of $1 million, or $0.02 per diluted common share. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased to $357 million in 2005 compared with $331 million in 2004, reflecting better FMS commercial rental results, higher gains on FMS used vehicle sales and reductions in operating expenses resulting from ongoing cost reduction activities and process improvement actions across all business segments, partially offset by the benefit from gains on the 2004 sale of our headquarters complex of $24 million. All business segments reported improved results. Earnings from continuing operations increased to $228 million in 2005 compared with $216 million in 2004. Earnings from continuing operations in 2005 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share, related to a change in Ohio income tax law. Earnings from continuing operations in 2004 benefited from after tax gains on the sale of our headquarters complex of $15 million, or $0.23 per diluted common share, and a net income tax benefit of $9 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share, associated with the resolution of various tax matters. Net earnings in 2005 included an after tax benefit of $2 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, related to discontinued operations and an after tax charge of $2 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share, for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the adoption of FIN 47. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes in 2004 increased to $331 million compared with $212 million in 2003. The earnings improvement in 2004 compared with 2003 was driven by the gain on sale of our headquarters complex, the positive impact of FMS acquisitions, increased FMS rental 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) pricing and utilization, higher gains on FMS used vehicle sales, lower pension costs, and reductions in operating expenses resulting from cost management and process improvement actions.

Additionally, revenue comparisons for all business segments were favorably impacted by pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs which increased fuel services revenue. FMS revenue was also positively impacted by higher rental revenue resulting from stronger pricing and increased contract related maintenance revenue from the implementation of growth initiatives. SCS revenue growth was primarily related to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. In addition, SCS and DCC revenue grew in 2005 due to new and expanded business. Revenue comparisons were also impacted by favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.9% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real. During 2004, FMS revenue was positively impacted by acquisitions and higher rental revenue resulting from a larger fleet, stronger pricing and increased activity. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Revenue comparisons were also impacted by increased FMS fuel services revenue primarily as a result of higher average fuel prices, and favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6% due to the strengthening of the British pound and the Canadian dollar. These increases were partially offset by reduced FMS full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) and the non renewal of certain customer contracts in our SCS and DCC business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at approximate fair value as if the sales were made to third parties. The increases in eliminations in 2005 and 2004 reflects the pass through of higher fuel costs from the FMS segment to SCS and DCC.

The overall growth in revenue, excluding fuel, also 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contributed to the increases in operating expense in 2005 and 2004. For 2004, operating expense was also impacted by higher maintenance costs, resulting from a larger and older vehicle fleet, and added operating costs attributed to the FMS acquisitions. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $ 1,262,160 1,233,038 1,242,930 2 % (1 ) Percentage of revenue 22% 24% 26% Salaries and employee related costs grew for 2005 compared with 2004 as a result of headcount added to support the growth in our SCS business segment, which was offset slightly by reduced performance based incentive compensation and lower employee benefit costs. Average headcount increased 2% in 2005 compared with 2004. The number of employees at December 31, 2005 increased 6% to approximately 27,800, compared with 26,300 at December 31, 2004, primarily due to the growth in our SCS business segment. Pension expense decreased $4 million in 2005 to $59 million compared with 2004 and principally impacted FMS. The decrease in pension expense reflects the positive impact of higher actual pension asset returns in 2004. We expect pension expense on a pre tax basis to increase approximately $9 million to $68 million in 2006. Our 2006 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. The anticipated increase in pension expense would primarily impact our FMS business segment. Salaries and employee related costs decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as a result of lower pension expense and lower headcount in our SCS and DCC business segments caused by the non renewal of certain contracts, offset in part by higher performance based incentive compensation. Average headcount decreased 1% in 2004 compared with 2003.

During 2005, subcontracted transportation expense in our SCS business segment grew due to increased volumes of freight management activity from new and expanded business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs, resulting from increased fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation expense increased in 2004 compared with 2003 principally as a result of added transportation management based business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs resulting from increased fuel costs. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $ 740,415 706,028 624,580 5 % 13 Gains on vehicle sales, net (47,098 ) (34,504 ) (15,780 ) 37 119 Equipment rental 102,816 108,468 200,868 (5 ) (46 ) 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. The growth in depreciation expense during 2005 is due to higher vehicle replacement activity within our truck and tractor fleets as well as the conversion of leased vehicles to owned status, partially offset by a decline in our average trailer fleet size. The growth in depreciation expense during 2004 reflected the consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003 (approximately $40 million), the impact of vehicles added as part of the FMS acquisitions, the conversion of leased units to owned status as a result of lease extensions and the replacement of expiring leased units with owned units. The improvements in gains on vehicle sales in 2005 and 2004 were due to an increase in the number of units sold combined with improved average pricing on vehicles sold over the preceding periods. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in losses on sales. Equipment rental primarily consists of rental costs on revenue earning equipment in FMS. The decrease in equipment rental in 2005 from 2004 is due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles when compared with 2004. The significant decrease in 2004 compared with 2003 was due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles (compared with owned) resulting from the consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003 (approximately $50 million), the conversion of leased units to owned status as a result of lease extensions and the replacement of expiring leased units with owned units.

The growth in interest expense in 2004 over 2003 reflects higher average debt levels, including debt of consolidated VIEs. Excluding interest expense from consolidated VIEs, comparisons for 2004 were favorably impacted by overall lower market interest rates and reduced effective interest rates as a result of hedging transactions, which principally benefited FMS. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Miscellaneous income, net $ (8,944 ) (6,625 ) (12,158 ) 35% (46 ) Miscellaneous income, net consists of investment income on securities used to fund certain benefit plans, interest income and other non operating items. Prior to the consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003, miscellaneous income, net also included servicing fee income for administrative services provided to vehicle lease trusts in connection with vehicle securitization transactions. Miscellaneous income, net increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to the one time recovery of $3 million for project costs incurred in prior years and better market performance of investments classified as trading securities used to fund certain benefit plans. Miscellaneous income, net decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 because of 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the elimination of servicing fee income related to certain VIEs. As a result of consolidating the vehicle securitization trusts, we no longer recognize service fee income. Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Restructuring and other charges (recoveries), net $ 3,376 (17,676 ) (230 ) 2005 Activity During 2005, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other charges of $3 million that consisted of employee severance and benefits, contract termination costs, and closure of leased facilities partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter and related primarily to the restructuring of our U.K. operations, and the offshoring of some administrative finance and support functions that will allow for future cost savings. We expect to realize annual pre tax cost savings of approximately $7 million from the 2005 fourth quarter actions, which are expected to be completed in the second half of 2006. During 2005, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 160 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in Ryders domestic and international FMS and SCS business segments and Central Support Services (CSS). The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $3 million. Cost reductions associated with these actions will benefit salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Many of the eliminated positions in our domestic operations were impacted by Ryders decision to outsource certain administrative finance functions to lower cost foreign providers and maximize our technology resources. Transition actions will begin in February 2006 and continue through the remainder of 2006. We also closed two administrative offices in the U.S. as a result of the restructuring of our FMS domestic business operations and recorded a charge for future cash payments related to lease obligations. As part of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions, Ryder management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced telecommunication services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 2010. In accordance with the terms of the services agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling nearly $1 million for contract termination costs. The transition activities are expected to be completed in the first half of 2006 and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services will benefit operating expenses starting in the latter part of 2006. These charges were partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals due to refinements in estimates. 2004 Activity During 2004, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other recoveries of $18 million that consisted of gains from the sale of the previous headquarters complex and reversals of severance and employee related accruals partially offset by contract termination costs. During 2004, we recognized $24 million in gains from properties sold in connection with the relocation of our headquarters. In May 2004, we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters facility for $39 million in cash and recognized a $22 million gain from the sale. In conjunction with this sale, we entered into a lease agreement with the purchaser to lease back the headquarters facility until we relocated to our new headquarters in April 2005. Also during 2004, we recognized gains totaling $2 million from the sale of properties ancillary to our main headquarters facility. In 2004, as part of ongoing cost containment initiatives, Ryder management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced information technology infrastructure services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2010. In accordance with the terms of the services agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling $8 million for contract termination ($6 million) and transition costs incurred since termination ($2 million). By December 31, 2004, all transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses starting in 2005. 2003 Activity During 2003, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 140 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in Ryders FMS and SCS business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $6 million. While many of these employees had not been terminated by December 31, 2003, such actions were substantially finalized by March 31, 2004. Estimated annual pre tax cost savings in salaries and employee related costs realized from these actions approximate $11 million. These charges were offset by reversals of severance and employee related accruals totaling $1 million due to refinements in estimates, recovery of $4 million from the settlement of a commercial dispute pertaining to prior billings with an information technology vendor and gains of $1 million on sales of owned facilities identified for closure in prior restructuring charges. See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges (Recoveries), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

While the corporate franchise (income) tax was generally based on federal taxable income, the CAT is based on current year sales and rentals in Ohio. As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the elimination of Ohios corporate franchise (income) tax over the next five years resulted in a favorable adjustment to deferred income taxes. The 2004 effective tax rate includes a net tax benefit of $9 million associated with the completion of the audit of our federal income tax returns for the 1995 to 1997 period, partially offset by provisions made for loss contingencies related to the 1998 through 2000 period.

CSS represents those costs incurred to support all of our business segments, including sales and marketing, human resources, finance, corporate services, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each of our business segments and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, corporate communications, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at approximate fair value as if the transactions were made with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) is included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer, and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2005 versus 2004 Total revenue grew in 2005 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue for 2005 increased as a result of higher commercial rental and contract related maintenance revenue and the impact of acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $21 million of total additional revenue in 2005. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2005 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.6%. Full service lease revenue increased in 2005 primarily from the acquisition completed in March 2004 and growth in Canada as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) acquisitions) in the first half of 2005. Our U.S. business showed improved revenue growth trends in the second half of 2005 as a result of positive net sales. In 2006, we expect growth in full service lease revenue due to recent sales activity and improving retention results. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we also restructured our FMS operations to better service customers and drive future growth in full service lease. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue, which generally represents ancillary services supporting core product lines, benefited from ongoing initiatives aimed at growing these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of stronger pricing and revenue contributions attributed to the acquisition completed in March 2004. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue to improve in 2006 based on improved pricing discipline. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates approximately 85% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 296,435 292,241 252,968 1% 16 Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 284,187 257,828 206,653 10% 25 Average commercial rental fleet size(2) 36,500 36,000 32,800 1% 10 Average commercial rental power fleet size (2),(3) 26,100 25,000 22,900 4% 9 Commercial rental utilization 74.6% 76.9% 72.1% (230) bps 480 bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT grew $42 million in 2005 as a result of improved commercial rental results from higher pricing, higher gains on disposal of used vehicles resulting from stronger volume and pricing, and lower overhead costs, including performance based incentive compensation. 2004 versus 2003 Total revenue grew in 2004 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices and higher volumes attributed to acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $177 million of revenue in 2004. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2004 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. Full service lease revenue increased in 2004 primarily from acquisitions that added approximately 7,000 vehicles to our lease fleet. Comparisons were also favorably impacted by higher revenue in Canada and the U.K. as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) as a result of weak leasing demand in 2003 and flat net sales in 2004. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue increased due to initiatives implemented to drive growth in these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of higher rental pricing and utilization in each of our markets and a 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) larger fleet size. Commercial rental revenue in 2004 also benefited from revenue contributions attributed to acquisitions. FMS NBT grew $118 million in 2004 as a result of the acquisitions that allowed us to leverage our existing infrastructure, improved commercial rental results from higher rental pricing and utilization, higher gains on disposal of used revenue earning equipment from stronger pricing and volume, and lower pension costs. The impact of these items was partially offset by lower full service lease and contract maintenance revenue in our base business (excluding acquired contracts).

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. NLE units represent vehicles held for sale, as well as vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. These vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to the higher level of lease vehicle replacement and increased out servicing activity of rental vehicles. In 2006, we expect the number of NLE units to remain at the current levels.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was primarily due to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation, is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2005, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect revenue improvements to continue over the near term. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of the year. 2004 versus 2003 SCS total revenue and operating revenue declined in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain U.S. and international customer contracts. Additionally, international operating revenue in 2003 included $21 million associated with an inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. The unfavorable operating revenue comparisons were partially offset by new contract start ups and expansions in the U.S., Canada and Latin America and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Both SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. In 2004, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 30% of SCS total revenue and 19% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT declined $3 million in 2004 primarily due to lower operating revenue partially offset by reduced overhead spending resulting from continued profit improvement actions. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 DCC total and operating revenue decreased in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain customer contracts, partially offset by the pass through of higher average fuel prices. DCC NBT declined $6 million in 2004 as a result of lower revenue, increased driver costs and higher safety and insurance expenses, partially offset by lower overhead spending. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarters facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarters relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. We expect reductions in CSS spending levels over the near term based on continuing cost containment and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 Total CSS costs decreased in 2004 as a result of ongoing cost containment and process improvement actions, most notably in information technology (IT). This decrease was partially offset by higher performance based incentive compensation costs attributed to the improved overall performance. Technology costs were lower in 2004 due primarily to reduced pricing on purchased IT services. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2004 largely due to Sarbanes Oxley compliance costs that were not allocated to the business segments and higher performance based incentive compensation. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Financing activities 241,505 (195,760 ) (232,796 ) Investing activities (988,855 ) (720,113 ) (543,165 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (3,956 ) 9,368 8,738 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 27,756 (39,656 ) 36,390 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to improved operating performance and the add back of depreciation expense attributed to VIEs that were consolidated effective July 1, 2003. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Cash used in financing activities decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher debt borrowings and proceeds from stock option exercises were partially offset by increased stock repurchases. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher capital expenditures, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. Cash used in investing activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due to higher capital expenditures and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions. Capital expenditures increased in 2004 due to planned higher levels of vehicle replacements for equipment under lease to our customers and new lease sales. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions completed during 2004. We manage our business to maximize operating cash flows and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities as free cash flow. Although free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure, we consider it to be an important measure of comparative operating performance. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Collections on direct finance leases 70,408 63,795 61,368 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,963 42,839 13,392 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,752 288,674 196,198 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 13,181 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) (734,509 ) Acquisitions (15,110 ) (148,791 ) (96,518 ) Other, net 21,511 6,995 3,723 Free cash flow $ (209,793 ) 146,736 260,448 We used $210 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $147 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) offset by lower acquisition spending. Free cash flow decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher capital spending and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions offset better operating performance, higher proceeds from sales of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions. Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow comparisons in the first half of 2004 were also positively impacted by the add back of depreciation expense of approximately $40 million attributed to VIEs that were consolidated as a result of the adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. We anticipate negative free cash flow levels to improve in 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower income tax payments. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,082,332 862,994 459,239 Commercial rental 251,278 241,858 219,880 1,333,610 1,104,852 679,119 Operating property and equipment 77,360 59,767 46,011 Total capital expenditures 1,410,970 1,164,619 725,130 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (11,591 ) (72,461 ) 9,379 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,399,379 1,092,158 734,509 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $0.4 million, $54 million and $67 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures grew in 2005 and 2004 due primarily to increased replacement activity in our full service lease business. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels should be relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. As a result of our fleet age and anticipated higher levels of new sales and replacement activity, total capital expenditures are anticipated to increase to approximately $1.6 billion in 2006, including lease vehicle replacements of approximately $1.1 billion and spending for anticipated incremental lease growth of approximately $200 million. We expect to fund 2006 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In both 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Ryder completed two acquisitions related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $15 million in 2005, $149 million in 2004 and $97 million in 2003. Approximately $4 million is due to the sellers at December 31, 2005 and will be paid subject to holdback 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) provisions set forth in the purchase agreements. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2006. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 1,783,216 1,815,900 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 188,271 79,033 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 600,000 135,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 162,124 147,153 Retirement of debentures (200,000 ) (72,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (343,933 ) (384,932 ) 406,462 (95,746 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (4,152 ) (9,380 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 433 54,094 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (593 ) 18,348 Total changes in debt 402,150 (32,684 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 32% at December 31, 2005, compared with 37% at December 31, 2004. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2005 Equity 2004 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,185,366 143% $ 1,783,216 118% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 117,062 161,138 Total obligations $ 2,302,428 151% $ 1,944,354 129% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total shareholders equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total shareholders equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess Ryders overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2005 was driven by our increased funding needs as a result of higher vehicle capital spending requirements, higher income tax payments and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A downgrade of Ryders debt rating below investment grade level would limit our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2005 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility is used primarily to finance working capital internationally and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. The credit facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no facility supported letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. During May 2005, the terms of the credit facility were amended thereby extending the expiration of the facility one year to 2010 and reducing the current annual facility fee from 15.0 basis points to 11.0 basis points. The annual facility fee applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2005 was 128%. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, we repaid $200 million of debentures. In September 2005, Ryder filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that were carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. The universal shelf registration statement became effective in November 2005. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) December 31, 2005, Ryder had $800 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder System, Inc., entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is similar to Ryders previous accounts receivable facility, which expired in December 2004, except that this program will be a 364 day facility. This program will be accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which would cause early termination, the program will expire on September 12, 2006, unless extended by the parties. At December 31, 2005, no receivables were sold pursuant to the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2005, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 474 Shelf registration statement 800 Trade receivables facility 200 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans and insurance companies) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be VIEs. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale and operating leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from such sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. These leases contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We did not enter into any sale and operating leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2003. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $16 million and $26 million, respectively, and we have accrued $3 million as a corresponding liability. See Note 17, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2005: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 268,716 438,880 865,837 610,113 2,183,546 Capital lease obligations 722 871 171 56 1,820 Total debt 269,438 439,751 866,008 610,169 2,185,366 Interest on debt(1) 113,332 174,251 120,934 223,016 631,533 Operating leases(2) 102,474 132,255 62,538 66,067 363,334 Purchase obligations(3) 28,794 33,543 8,975 71,312 Total contractual cash obligations 244,600 340,049 192,447 289,083 1,066,179 Insurance obligations(4) 111,163 99,107 40,156 52,814 303,240 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 13,115 1,001 17,104 31,220 Total $ 625,201 892,022 1,099,612 969,170 3,586,005 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2005. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to information technology services. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were derivative contracts, deferred compensation obligations and legal contractual obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2006, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $71 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2006 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $115 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In connection with the accrual of the additional minimum pension liability, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $221 million and $189 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which increased at December 31, 2005 as reductions in discount rates offset the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 7% in 2005. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may, from time to time, make voluntary contributions to our pension plans. During 2005, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $12 million compared with $70 million in 2004. After considering the 2005 contributions, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $115 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. Share Repurchases and Cash Dividends In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. At December 31, 2005, we had repurchased and retired approximately 2.6 million shares under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $109 million. Management has established a prearranged written plan under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allows for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We expect to complete the October 2005 program in the first quarter of 2006. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through employee stock purchase plans since May 1, 2004, which totaled approximately 2.4 million shares at December 31, 2005. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan under Rule 10b5 1 as part of the July 2004 program. In 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate, in part, the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003 up to $90 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the 2003 program. In 2004 and 2003, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million and 117,500 shares, respectively, under the 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million and $3 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $41 million in 2005, $39 million in 2004 and $38 million in 2003. During 2005, we increased our annual dividend to $0.64 per share of common stock. In February 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.16 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2005. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 16, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.5 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement totaled $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% and a fair value of $1.2 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2004 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $13 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements totaled $0.8 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $607 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $285 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2004 totaled $5 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2006 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $10 million and $16 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.1 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $9 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2005, we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004 and $1 million in 2003. We incurred environmental expenses of $9 million, $10 million and $12 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2005 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2005, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2006, which will cause depreciation expense in 2006 to decrease by approximately $13 million compared with 2005. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2006 by approximately $85 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2005, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $5 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2006 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 76% equity securities and 24% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an unrecognized loss of $428 million at the end of 2005 compared with a loss of $371 million at the end of 2004. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2005 results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and assets earning a rate of return below the assumed rates offset in part by the amortization of the opening balance. To the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. The amount of the unrecognized loss subject to amortization in 2006 will be $281 million. The effect on years beyond 2006 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2005 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2006 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2006 Net December 31, 2005 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.90% + 0.25% $5 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.90% 0.25% + $5 million + $41 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $2 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2005, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2006 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2005, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $156 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, in certain instances (typically when we manage transportation for our customers), we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis. In transportation management contracts where we act as an agent, we have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. In addition, we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments. During 2005, we entered into a significant SCS managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as principal in the arrangement. As a result, we recognized an additional $135 million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in 2005 by reporting revenue on a gross basis. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $235 million and $257 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. The amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at December 31, 2004 and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Share Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of SFAS No. 123R would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax benefits and headquarters complex sale. We believe that the comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Forward looking statements (within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) are statements that relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends concerning matters that are not historical facts.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (In thousands, except per share amounts) Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 357,088 331,122 212,475 8 % 56 Provision for income taxes(1) 129,460 115,513 76,916 12 50 Earnings from continuing operations(1),(2) $ 227,628 215,609 135,559 6 % 59 Per diluted common share $ 3.53 3.28 2.12 8 % 55 Net earnings(1),(2),(3) $ 226,929 215,609 131,436 5 % 64 Per diluted common share $ 3.52 3.28 2.06 7 % 59 Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 64,560 65,671 63,871 (2 )% 3 (1) 2005 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share, associated with the reduction of deferred income taxes due to the phaseout of income taxes for the State of Ohio. 2004 included an income tax benefit of $9 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share, associated with developments in various tax matters. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. (2) Results included restructuring and other charges (recoveries), net of $2 million after tax, or $0.03 per diluted common share, in 2005 and $(11) million after tax, or $(0.17) per diluted common share, in 2004. See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges (Recoveries), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. (3) Net earnings for 2005 included (i) income from discontinued operations associated with the reduction of insurance reserves related to discontinued operations resulting in an after tax benefit of $2 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, and (ii) the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for costs associated with the future removal of underground storage tanks resulting in an after tax charge of $2 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share. Net earnings for 2003 included the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for (i) variable interest entities resulting in an after tax charge of $3 million, or $0.05 per diluted common share, and (ii) costs associated with eventual retirement of long lived assets primarily relating to components of revenue earning equipment resulting in an after tax charge of $1 million, or $0.02 per diluted common share. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased to $357 million in 2005 compared with $331 million in 2004, reflecting better FMS commercial rental results, higher gains on FMS used vehicle sales and reductions in operating expenses resulting from ongoing cost reduction activities and process improvement actions across all business segments, partially offset by the benefit from gains on the 2004 sale of our headquarters complex of $24 million. All business segments reported improved results. Earnings from continuing operations increased to $228 million in 2005 compared with $216 million in 2004. Earnings from continuing operations in 2005 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share, related to a change in Ohio income tax law. Earnings from continuing operations in 2004 benefited from after tax gains on the sale of our headquarters complex of $15 million, or $0.23 per diluted common share, and a net income tax benefit of $9 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share, associated with the resolution of various tax matters. Net earnings in 2005 included an after tax benefit of $2 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, related to discontinued operations and an after tax charge of $2 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share, for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the adoption of FIN 47. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes in 2004 increased to $331 million compared with $212 million in 2003. The earnings improvement in 2004 compared with 2003 was driven by the gain on sale of our headquarters complex, the positive impact of FMS acquisitions, increased FMS rental 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) pricing and utilization, higher gains on FMS used vehicle sales, lower pension costs, and reductions in operating expenses resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. See Operating Results by Business Segment for further discussion of operating results for the past three years. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Revenue: Fleet Management Solutions $ 3,921,191 3,602,839 3,231,675 9 % 11 Supply Chain Solutions 1,637,826 1,354,003 1,362,428 21 (1 ) Dedicated Contract Carriage 543,268 506,100 514,731 7 (2 ) Eliminations (361,438 ) (312,664 ) (306,540 ) (16 ) (2 ) Total $ 5,740,847 5,150,278 4,802,294 11 % 7 All business segments reported revenue growth in 2005. Additionally, revenue comparisons for all business segments were favorably impacted by pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs which increased fuel services revenue. FMS revenue was also positively impacted by higher rental revenue resulting from stronger pricing and increased contract related maintenance revenue from the implementation of growth initiatives. SCS revenue growth was primarily related to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. In addition, SCS and DCC revenue grew in 2005 due to new and expanded business. Revenue comparisons were also impacted by favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.9% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real. During 2004, FMS revenue was positively impacted by acquisitions and higher rental revenue resulting from a larger fleet, stronger pricing and increased activity. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Revenue comparisons were also impacted by increased FMS fuel services revenue primarily as a result of higher average fuel prices, and favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6% due to the strengthening of the British pound and the Canadian dollar. These increases were partially offset by reduced FMS full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) and the non renewal of certain customer contracts in our SCS and DCC business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at approximate fair value as if the sales were made to third parties. The increases in eliminations in 2005 and 2004 reflects the pass through of higher fuel costs from the FMS segment to SCS and DCC. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Operating expense (exclusive of items shown separately) $ 2,572,241 2,305,322 2,039,156 12 % 13 Percentage of revenue 45% 45% 42% Operating expense grew for 2005 and 2004 principally from higher fuel costs due to higher average fuel prices. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. The overall growth in revenue, excluding fuel, also 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contributed to the increases in operating expense in 2005 and 2004. For 2004, operating expense was also impacted by higher maintenance costs, resulting from a larger and older vehicle fleet, and added operating costs attributed to the FMS acquisitions. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $ 1,262,160 1,233,038 1,242,930 2 % (1 ) Percentage of revenue 22% 24% 26% Salaries and employee related costs grew for 2005 compared with 2004 as a result of headcount added to support the growth in our SCS business segment, which was offset slightly by reduced performance based incentive compensation and lower employee benefit costs. Average headcount increased 2% in 2005 compared with 2004. The number of employees at December 31, 2005 increased 6% to approximately 27,800, compared with 26,300 at December 31, 2004, primarily due to the growth in our SCS business segment. Pension expense decreased $4 million in 2005 to $59 million compared with 2004 and principally impacted FMS. The decrease in pension expense reflects the positive impact of higher actual pension asset returns in 2004. We expect pension expense on a pre tax basis to increase approximately $9 million to $68 million in 2006. Our 2006 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. The anticipated increase in pension expense would primarily impact our FMS business segment. Salaries and employee related costs decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as a result of lower pension expense and lower headcount in our SCS and DCC business segments caused by the non renewal of certain contracts, offset in part by higher performance based incentive compensation. Average headcount decreased 1% in 2004 compared with 2003. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $ 638,319 424,991 414,284 50 % 3 Percentage of revenue 11% 8% 9% Subcontracted transportation represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. During 2005, subcontracted transportation expense in our SCS business segment grew due to increased volumes of freight management activity from new and expanded business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs, resulting from increased fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation expense increased in 2004 compared with 2003 principally as a result of added transportation management based business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs resulting from increased fuel costs. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $ 740,415 706,028 624,580 5 % 13 Gains on vehicle sales, net (47,098 ) (34,504 ) (15,780 ) 37 119 Equipment rental 102,816 108,468 200,868 (5 ) (46 ) 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. The growth in depreciation expense during 2005 is due to higher vehicle replacement activity within our truck and tractor fleets as well as the conversion of leased vehicles to owned status, partially offset by a decline in our average trailer fleet size. The growth in depreciation expense during 2004 reflected the consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003 (approximately $40 million), the impact of vehicles added as part of the FMS acquisitions, the conversion of leased units to owned status as a result of lease extensions and the replacement of expiring leased units with owned units. The improvements in gains on vehicle sales in 2005 and 2004 were due to an increase in the number of units sold combined with improved average pricing on vehicles sold over the preceding periods. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in losses on sales. Equipment rental primarily consists of rental costs on revenue earning equipment in FMS. The decrease in equipment rental in 2005 from 2004 is due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles when compared with 2004. The significant decrease in 2004 compared with 2003 was due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles (compared with owned) resulting from the consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003 (approximately $50 million), the conversion of leased units to owned status as a result of lease extensions and the replacement of expiring leased units with owned units. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $ 120,474 100,114 96,169 20% 4 Effective interest rate 5.6% 5.5% 5.8% Interest expense grew in 2005 reflecting higher average debt levels, resulting from increased capital spending, income tax payments and share repurchases. The growth in interest expense in 2004 over 2003 reflects higher average debt levels, including debt of consolidated VIEs. Excluding interest expense from consolidated VIEs, comparisons for 2004 were favorably impacted by overall lower market interest rates and reduced effective interest rates as a result of hedging transactions, which principally benefited FMS. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Miscellaneous income, net $ (8,944 ) (6,625 ) (12,158 ) 35% (46 ) Miscellaneous income, net consists of investment income on securities used to fund certain benefit plans, interest income and other non operating items. Prior to the consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003, miscellaneous income, net also included servicing fee income for administrative services provided to vehicle lease trusts in connection with vehicle securitization transactions. Miscellaneous income, net increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to the one time recovery of $3 million for project costs incurred in prior years and better market performance of investments classified as trading securities used to fund certain benefit plans. Miscellaneous income, net decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 because of 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the elimination of servicing fee income related to certain VIEs. As a result of consolidating the vehicle securitization trusts, we no longer recognize service fee income. Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Restructuring and other charges (recoveries), net $ 3,376 (17,676 ) (230 ) 2005 Activity During 2005, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other charges of $3 million that consisted of employee severance and benefits, contract termination costs, and closure of leased facilities partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter and related primarily to the restructuring of our U.K. operations, and the offshoring of some administrative finance and support functions that will allow for future cost savings. We expect to realize annual pre tax cost savings of approximately $7 million from the 2005 fourth quarter actions, which are expected to be completed in the second half of 2006. During 2005, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 160 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in Ryders domestic and international FMS and SCS business segments and Central Support Services (CSS). The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $3 million. Cost reductions associated with these actions will benefit salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Many of the eliminated positions in our domestic operations were impacted by Ryders decision to outsource certain administrative finance functions to lower cost foreign providers and maximize our technology resources. Transition actions will begin in February 2006 and continue through the remainder of 2006. We also closed two administrative offices in the U.S. as a result of the restructuring of our FMS domestic business operations and recorded a charge for future cash payments related to lease obligations. As part of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions, Ryder management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced telecommunication services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 2010. In accordance with the terms of the services agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling nearly $1 million for contract termination costs. The transition activities are expected to be completed in the first half of 2006 and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services will benefit operating expenses starting in the latter part of 2006. These charges were partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals due to refinements in estimates. 2004 Activity During 2004, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other recoveries of $18 million that consisted of gains from the sale of the previous headquarters complex and reversals of severance and employee related accruals partially offset by contract termination costs. During 2004, we recognized $24 million in gains from properties sold in connection with the relocation of our headquarters. In May 2004, we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters facility for $39 million in cash and recognized a $22 million gain from the sale. In conjunction with this sale, we entered into a lease agreement with the purchaser to lease back the headquarters facility until we relocated to our new headquarters in April 2005. Also during 2004, we recognized gains totaling $2 million from the sale of properties ancillary to our main headquarters facility. In 2004, as part of ongoing cost containment initiatives, Ryder management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced information technology infrastructure services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2010. In accordance with the terms of the services agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling $8 million for contract termination ($6 million) and transition costs incurred since termination ($2 million). By December 31, 2004, all transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses starting in 2005. 2003 Activity During 2003, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 140 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in Ryders FMS and SCS business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $6 million. While many of these employees had not been terminated by December 31, 2003, such actions were substantially finalized by March 31, 2004. Estimated annual pre tax cost savings in salaries and employee related costs realized from these actions approximate $11 million. These charges were offset by reversals of severance and employee related accruals totaling $1 million due to refinements in estimates, recovery of $4 million from the settlement of a commercial dispute pertaining to prior billings with an information technology vendor and gains of $1 million on sales of owned facilities identified for closure in prior restructuring charges. See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges (Recoveries), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Provision for income taxes $ 129,460 115,513 76,916 12 % 50 Effective tax rate 36.3% 34.9% 36.2% The 2005 effective tax rate includes a tax benefit of $8 million associated with the State of Ohio enacted tax legislation, which phases out the Ohio corporate franchise (income) tax and phases in a new gross receipts tax called the Commercial Activity Tax (CAT) over a five year period. While the corporate franchise (income) tax was generally based on federal taxable income, the CAT is based on current year sales and rentals in Ohio. As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the elimination of Ohios corporate franchise (income) tax over the next five years resulted in a favorable adjustment to deferred income taxes. The 2004 effective tax rate includes a net tax benefit of $9 million associated with the completion of the audit of our federal income tax returns for the 1995 to 1997 period, partially offset by provisions made for loss contingencies related to the 1998 through 2000 period. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS represents those costs incurred to support all of our business segments, including sales and marketing, human resources, finance, corporate services, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each of our business segments and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, corporate communications, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at approximate fair value as if the transactions were made with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) is included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer, and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 15,860 14,971 15,319 Dedicated Contract Carriage 16,800 17,757 18,267 Total $ 32,660 32,728 33,586 Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2005 versus 2004 Total revenue grew in 2005 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue for 2005 increased as a result of higher commercial rental and contract related maintenance revenue and the impact of acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $21 million of total additional revenue in 2005. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2005 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.6%. Full service lease revenue increased in 2005 primarily from the acquisition completed in March 2004 and growth in Canada as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) acquisitions) in the first half of 2005. Our U.S. business showed improved revenue growth trends in the second half of 2005 as a result of positive net sales. In 2006, we expect growth in full service lease revenue due to recent sales activity and improving retention results. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we also restructured our FMS operations to better service customers and drive future growth in full service lease. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue, which generally represents ancillary services supporting core product lines, benefited from ongoing initiatives aimed at growing these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of stronger pricing and revenue contributions attributed to the acquisition completed in March 2004. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue to improve in 2006 based on improved pricing discipline. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates approximately 85% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 296,435 292,241 252,968 1% 16 Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 284,187 257,828 206,653 10% 25 Average commercial rental fleet size(2) 36,500 36,000 32,800 1% 10 Average commercial rental power fleet size (2),(3) 26,100 25,000 22,900 4% 9 Commercial rental utilization 74.6% 76.9% 72.1% (230) bps 480 bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT grew $42 million in 2005 as a result of improved commercial rental results from higher pricing, higher gains on disposal of used vehicles resulting from stronger volume and pricing, and lower overhead costs, including performance based incentive compensation. 2004 versus 2003 Total revenue grew in 2004 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices and higher volumes attributed to acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $177 million of revenue in 2004. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2004 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. Full service lease revenue increased in 2004 primarily from acquisitions that added approximately 7,000 vehicles to our lease fleet. Comparisons were also favorably impacted by higher revenue in Canada and the U.K. as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) as a result of weak leasing demand in 2003 and flat net sales in 2004. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue increased due to initiatives implemented to drive growth in these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of higher rental pricing and utilization in each of our markets and a 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) larger fleet size. Commercial rental revenue in 2004 also benefited from revenue contributions attributed to acquisitions. FMS NBT grew $118 million in 2004 as a result of the acquisitions that allowed us to leverage our existing infrastructure, improved commercial rental results from higher rental pricing and utilization, higher gains on disposal of used revenue earning equipment from stronger pricing and volume, and lower pension costs. The impact of these items was partially offset by lower full service lease and contract maintenance revenue in our base business (excluding acquired contracts). Our global fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment and contract maintenance vehicles is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ Number of Units 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 End of period count By type: Trucks 63,200 63,700 62,400 (1 )% 2 Tractors 52,700 51,700 48,900 2 6 Trailers 40,600 43,100 43,200 (6 ) Other 5,800 5,900 5,700 (2 ) 4 Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 By product line: Full service lease 118,400 119,700 118,900 (1 )% 1 Commercial rental 40,500 41,700 38,500 (3 ) 8 Service and other vehicles 3,400 3,000 2,800 13 7 Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 Owned(1) 156,500 157,000 150,200 % 5 Leased 5,800 7,400 10,000 (22 ) (26 ) Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 Full year average 164,900 164,300 160,000 % 3 Customer vehicles under contract maintenance (end of period) 26,400 28,500 29,000 (7 )% (2 ) (1) Effective March 1, 2004, approximately 6,400 units were added to the fleet as part of the Ruan acquisition. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. NLE units represent vehicles held for sale, as well as vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. These vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to the higher level of lease vehicle replacement and increased out servicing activity of rental vehicles. In 2006, we expect the number of NLE units to remain at the current levels.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was primarily due to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation, is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2005, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect revenue improvements to continue over the near term. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of the year. 2004 versus 2003 SCS total revenue and operating revenue declined in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain U.S. and international customer contracts. Additionally, international operating revenue in 2003 included $21 million associated with an inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. The unfavorable operating revenue comparisons were partially offset by new contract start ups and expansions in the U.S., Canada and Latin America and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Both SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. In 2004, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 30% of SCS total revenue and 19% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT declined $3 million in 2004 primarily due to lower operating revenue partially offset by reduced overhead spending resulting from continued profit improvement actions. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 DCC total and operating revenue decreased in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain customer contracts, partially offset by the pass through of higher average fuel prices. DCC NBT declined $6 million in 2004 as a result of lower revenue, increased driver costs and higher safety and insurance expenses, partially offset by lower overhead spending. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarters facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarters relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. We expect reductions in CSS spending levels over the near term based on continuing cost containment and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 Total CSS costs decreased in 2004 as a result of ongoing cost containment and process improvement actions, most notably in information technology (IT). This decrease was partially offset by higher performance based incentive compensation costs attributed to the improved overall performance. Technology costs were lower in 2004 due primarily to reduced pricing on purchased IT services. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2004 largely due to Sarbanes Oxley compliance costs that were not allocated to the business segments and higher performance based incentive compensation. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Financing activities 241,505 (195,760 ) (232,796 ) Investing activities (988,855 ) (720,113 ) (543,165 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (3,956 ) 9,368 8,738 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 27,756 (39,656 ) 36,390 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to improved operating performance and the add back of depreciation expense attributed to VIEs that were consolidated effective July 1, 2003. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Cash used in financing activities decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher debt borrowings and proceeds from stock option exercises were partially offset by increased stock repurchases. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher capital expenditures, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. Cash used in investing activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due to higher capital expenditures and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions. Capital expenditures increased in 2004 due to planned higher levels of vehicle replacements for equipment under lease to our customers and new lease sales. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions completed during 2004. We manage our business to maximize operating cash flows and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities as free cash flow. Although free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure, we consider it to be an important measure of comparative operating performance. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Collections on direct finance leases 70,408 63,795 61,368 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,963 42,839 13,392 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,752 288,674 196,198 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 13,181 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) (734,509 ) Acquisitions (15,110 ) (148,791 ) (96,518 ) Other, net 21,511 6,995 3,723 Free cash flow $ (209,793 ) 146,736 260,448 We used $210 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $147 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) offset by lower acquisition spending. Free cash flow decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher capital spending and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions offset better operating performance, higher proceeds from sales of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions. Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow comparisons in the first half of 2004 were also positively impacted by the add back of depreciation expense of approximately $40 million attributed to VIEs that were consolidated as a result of the adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. We anticipate negative free cash flow levels to improve in 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower income tax payments. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,082,332 862,994 459,239 Commercial rental 251,278 241,858 219,880 1,333,610 1,104,852 679,119 Operating property and equipment 77,360 59,767 46,011 Total capital expenditures 1,410,970 1,164,619 725,130 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (11,591 ) (72,461 ) 9,379 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,399,379 1,092,158 734,509 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $0.4 million, $54 million and $67 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures grew in 2005 and 2004 due primarily to increased replacement activity in our full service lease business. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels should be relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. As a result of our fleet age and anticipated higher levels of new sales and replacement activity, total capital expenditures are anticipated to increase to approximately $1.6 billion in 2006, including lease vehicle replacements of approximately $1.1 billion and spending for anticipated incremental lease growth of approximately $200 million. We expect to fund 2006 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In both 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Ryder completed two acquisitions related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $15 million in 2005, $149 million in 2004 and $97 million in 2003. Approximately $4 million is due to the sellers at December 31, 2005 and will be paid subject to holdback 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) provisions set forth in the purchase agreements. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2006. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 1,783,216 1,815,900 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 188,271 79,033 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 600,000 135,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 162,124 147,153 Retirement of debentures (200,000 ) (72,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (343,933 ) (384,932 ) 406,462 (95,746 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (4,152 ) (9,380 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 433 54,094 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (593 ) 18,348 Total changes in debt 402,150 (32,684 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 32% at December 31, 2005, compared with 37% at December 31, 2004. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2005 Equity 2004 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,185,366 143% $ 1,783,216 118% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 117,062 161,138 Total obligations $ 2,302,428 151% $ 1,944,354 129% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total shareholders equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total shareholders equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess Ryders overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2005 was driven by our increased funding needs as a result of higher vehicle capital spending requirements, higher income tax payments and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A downgrade of Ryders debt rating below investment grade level would limit our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2005 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility is used primarily to finance working capital internationally and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. The credit facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no facility supported letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. During May 2005, the terms of the credit facility were amended thereby extending the expiration of the facility one year to 2010 and reducing the current annual facility fee from 15.0 basis points to 11.0 basis points. The annual facility fee applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2005 was 128%. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, we repaid $200 million of debentures. In September 2005, Ryder filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that were carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. The universal shelf registration statement became effective in November 2005. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) December 31, 2005, Ryder had $800 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder System, Inc., entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is similar to Ryders previous accounts receivable facility, which expired in December 2004, except that this program will be a 364 day facility. This program will be accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which would cause early termination, the program will expire on September 12, 2006, unless extended by the parties. At December 31, 2005, no receivables were sold pursuant to the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2005, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 474 Shelf registration statement 800 Trade receivables facility 200 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans and insurance companies) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be VIEs. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale and operating leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from such sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. These leases contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We did not enter into any sale and operating leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2003. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $16 million and $26 million, respectively, and we have accrued $3 million as a corresponding liability. See Note 17, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2005: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 268,716 438,880 865,837 610,113 2,183,546 Capital lease obligations 722 871 171 56 1,820 Total debt 269,438 439,751 866,008 610,169 2,185,366 Interest on debt(1) 113,332 174,251 120,934 223,016 631,533 Operating leases(2) 102,474 132,255 62,538 66,067 363,334 Purchase obligations(3) 28,794 33,543 8,975 71,312 Total contractual cash obligations 244,600 340,049 192,447 289,083 1,066,179 Insurance obligations(4) 111,163 99,107 40,156 52,814 303,240 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 13,115 1,001 17,104 31,220 Total $ 625,201 892,022 1,099,612 969,170 3,586,005 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2005. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to information technology services. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were derivative contracts, deferred compensation obligations and legal contractual obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2006, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $71 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2006 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $115 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In connection with the accrual of the additional minimum pension liability, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $221 million and $189 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which increased at December 31, 2005 as reductions in discount rates offset the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 7% in 2005. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may, from time to time, make voluntary contributions to our pension plans. During 2005, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $12 million compared with $70 million in 2004. After considering the 2005 contributions, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $115 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. Share Repurchases and Cash Dividends In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. At December 31, 2005, we had repurchased and retired approximately 2.6 million shares under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $109 million. Management has established a prearranged written plan under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allows for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We expect to complete the October 2005 program in the first quarter of 2006. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through employee stock purchase plans since May 1, 2004, which totaled approximately 2.4 million shares at December 31, 2005. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan under Rule 10b5 1 as part of the July 2004 program. In 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate, in part, the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003 up to $90 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the 2003 program. In 2004 and 2003, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million and 117,500 shares, respectively, under the 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million and $3 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $41 million in 2005, $39 million in 2004 and $38 million in 2003. During 2005, we increased our annual dividend to $0.64 per share of common stock. In February 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.16 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2005. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 16, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.5 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement totaled $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% and a fair value of $1.2 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2004 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $13 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements totaled $0.8 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $607 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $285 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2004 totaled $5 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2006 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $10 million and $16 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.1 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $9 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2005, we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004 and $1 million in 2003. We incurred environmental expenses of $9 million, $10 million and $12 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2005 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2005, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2006, which will cause depreciation expense in 2006 to decrease by approximately $13 million compared with 2005. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2006 by approximately $85 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2005, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $5 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2006 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 76% equity securities and 24% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an unrecognized loss of $428 million at the end of 2005 compared with a loss of $371 million at the end of 2004. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2005 results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and assets earning a rate of return below the assumed rates offset in part by the amortization of the opening balance. To the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. The amount of the unrecognized loss subject to amortization in 2006 will be $281 million. The effect on years beyond 2006 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2005 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2006 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2006 Net December 31, 2005 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.90% + 0.25% $5 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.90% 0.25% + $5 million + $41 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $2 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2005, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2006 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2005, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $156 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, in certain instances (typically when we manage transportation for our customers), we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis. In transportation management contracts where we act as an agent, we have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. In addition, we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments. During 2005, we entered into a significant SCS managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as principal in the arrangement. As a result, we recognized an additional $135 million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in 2005 by reporting revenue on a gross basis. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $235 million and $257 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. The amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at December 31, 2004 and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Share Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of SFAS No. 123R would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax benefits and headquarters complex sale. We believe that the comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

See Operating Results by Business Segment for further discussion of operating results for the past three years. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Revenue: Fleet Management Solutions $ 3,921,191 3,602,839 3,231,675 9 % 11 Supply Chain Solutions 1,637,826 1,354,003 1,362,428 21 (1 ) Dedicated Contract Carriage 543,268 506,100 514,731 7 (2 ) Eliminations (361,438 ) (312,664 ) (306,540 ) (16 ) (2 ) Total $ 5,740,847 5,150,278 4,802,294 11 % 7 All business segments reported revenue growth in 2005. Additionally, revenue comparisons for all business segments were favorably impacted by pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs which increased fuel services revenue. FMS revenue was also positively impacted by higher rental revenue resulting from stronger pricing and increased contract related maintenance revenue from the implementation of growth initiatives. SCS revenue growth was primarily related to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. In addition, SCS and DCC revenue grew in 2005 due to new and expanded business. Revenue comparisons were also impacted by favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.9% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real. During 2004, FMS revenue was positively impacted by acquisitions and higher rental revenue resulting from a larger fleet, stronger pricing and increased activity. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Revenue comparisons were also impacted by increased FMS fuel services revenue primarily as a result of higher average fuel prices, and favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6% due to the strengthening of the British pound and the Canadian dollar. These increases were partially offset by reduced FMS full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) and the non renewal of certain customer contracts in our SCS and DCC business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at approximate fair value as if the sales were made to third parties. The increases in eliminations in 2005 and 2004 reflects the pass through of higher fuel costs from the FMS segment to SCS and DCC. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Operating expense (exclusive of items shown separately) $ 2,572,241 2,305,322 2,039,156 12 % 13 Percentage of revenue 45% 45% 42% Operating expense grew for 2005 and 2004 principally from higher fuel costs due to higher average fuel prices. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. The overall growth in revenue, excluding fuel, also 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contributed to the increases in operating expense in 2005 and 2004. For 2004, operating expense was also impacted by higher maintenance costs, resulting from a larger and older vehicle fleet, and added operating costs attributed to the FMS acquisitions. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $ 1,262,160 1,233,038 1,242,930 2 % (1 ) Percentage of revenue 22% 24% 26% Salaries and employee related costs grew for 2005 compared with 2004 as a result of headcount added to support the growth in our SCS business segment, which was offset slightly by reduced performance based incentive compensation and lower employee benefit costs. Average headcount increased 2% in 2005 compared with 2004. The number of employees at December 31, 2005 increased 6% to approximately 27,800, compared with 26,300 at December 31, 2004, primarily due to the growth in our SCS business segment. Pension expense decreased $4 million in 2005 to $59 million compared with 2004 and principally impacted FMS. The decrease in pension expense reflects the positive impact of higher actual pension asset returns in 2004. We expect pension expense on a pre tax basis to increase approximately $9 million to $68 million in 2006. Our 2006 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. The anticipated increase in pension expense would primarily impact our FMS business segment. Salaries and employee related costs decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as a result of lower pension expense and lower headcount in our SCS and DCC business segments caused by the non renewal of certain contracts, offset in part by higher performance based incentive compensation. Average headcount decreased 1% in 2004 compared with 2003. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $ 638,319 424,991 414,284 50 % 3 Percentage of revenue 11% 8% 9% Subcontracted transportation represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. During 2005, subcontracted transportation expense in our SCS business segment grew due to increased volumes of freight management activity from new and expanded business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs, resulting from increased fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation expense increased in 2004 compared with 2003 principally as a result of added transportation management based business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs resulting from increased fuel costs. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $ 740,415 706,028 624,580 5 % 13 Gains on vehicle sales, net (47,098 ) (34,504 ) (15,780 ) 37 119 Equipment rental 102,816 108,468 200,868 (5 ) (46 ) 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. The growth in depreciation expense during 2005 is due to higher vehicle replacement activity within our truck and tractor fleets as well as the conversion of leased vehicles to owned status, partially offset by a decline in our average trailer fleet size. The growth in depreciation expense during 2004 reflected the consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003 (approximately $40 million), the impact of vehicles added as part of the FMS acquisitions, the conversion of leased units to owned status as a result of lease extensions and the replacement of expiring leased units with owned units. The improvements in gains on vehicle sales in 2005 and 2004 were due to an increase in the number of units sold combined with improved average pricing on vehicles sold over the preceding periods. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in losses on sales. Equipment rental primarily consists of rental costs on revenue earning equipment in FMS. The decrease in equipment rental in 2005 from 2004 is due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles when compared with 2004. The significant decrease in 2004 compared with 2003 was due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles (compared with owned) resulting from the consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003 (approximately $50 million), the conversion of leased units to owned status as a result of lease extensions and the replacement of expiring leased units with owned units. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $ 120,474 100,114 96,169 20% 4 Effective interest rate 5.6% 5.5% 5.8% Interest expense grew in 2005 reflecting higher average debt levels, resulting from increased capital spending, income tax payments and share repurchases. The growth in interest expense in 2004 over 2003 reflects higher average debt levels, including debt of consolidated VIEs. Excluding interest expense from consolidated VIEs, comparisons for 2004 were favorably impacted by overall lower market interest rates and reduced effective interest rates as a result of hedging transactions, which principally benefited FMS. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Miscellaneous income, net $ (8,944 ) (6,625 ) (12,158 ) 35% (46 ) Miscellaneous income, net consists of investment income on securities used to fund certain benefit plans, interest income and other non operating items. Prior to the consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003, miscellaneous income, net also included servicing fee income for administrative services provided to vehicle lease trusts in connection with vehicle securitization transactions. Miscellaneous income, net increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to the one time recovery of $3 million for project costs incurred in prior years and better market performance of investments classified as trading securities used to fund certain benefit plans. Miscellaneous income, net decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 because of 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the elimination of servicing fee income related to certain VIEs. As a result of consolidating the vehicle securitization trusts, we no longer recognize service fee income. Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Restructuring and other charges (recoveries), net $ 3,376 (17,676 ) (230 ) 2005 Activity During 2005, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other charges of $3 million that consisted of employee severance and benefits, contract termination costs, and closure of leased facilities partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter and related primarily to the restructuring of our U.K. operations, and the offshoring of some administrative finance and support functions that will allow for future cost savings. We expect to realize annual pre tax cost savings of approximately $7 million from the 2005 fourth quarter actions, which are expected to be completed in the second half of 2006. During 2005, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 160 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in Ryders domestic and international FMS and SCS business segments and Central Support Services (CSS). The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $3 million. Cost reductions associated with these actions will benefit salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Many of the eliminated positions in our domestic operations were impacted by Ryders decision to outsource certain administrative finance functions to lower cost foreign providers and maximize our technology resources. Transition actions will begin in February 2006 and continue through the remainder of 2006. We also closed two administrative offices in the U.S. as a result of the restructuring of our FMS domestic business operations and recorded a charge for future cash payments related to lease obligations. As part of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions, Ryder management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced telecommunication services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 2010. In accordance with the terms of the services agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling nearly $1 million for contract termination costs. The transition activities are expected to be completed in the first half of 2006 and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services will benefit operating expenses starting in the latter part of 2006. These charges were partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals due to refinements in estimates. 2004 Activity During 2004, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other recoveries of $18 million that consisted of gains from the sale of the previous headquarters complex and reversals of severance and employee related accruals partially offset by contract termination costs. During 2004, we recognized $24 million in gains from properties sold in connection with the relocation of our headquarters. In May 2004, we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters facility for $39 million in cash and recognized a $22 million gain from the sale. In conjunction with this sale, we entered into a lease agreement with the purchaser to lease back the headquarters facility until we relocated to our new headquarters in April 2005. Also during 2004, we recognized gains totaling $2 million from the sale of properties ancillary to our main headquarters facility. In 2004, as part of ongoing cost containment initiatives, Ryder management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced information technology infrastructure services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2010. In accordance with the terms of the services agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling $8 million for contract termination ($6 million) and transition costs incurred since termination ($2 million). By December 31, 2004, all transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses starting in 2005. 2003 Activity During 2003, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 140 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in Ryders FMS and SCS business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $6 million. While many of these employees had not been terminated by December 31, 2003, such actions were substantially finalized by March 31, 2004. Estimated annual pre tax cost savings in salaries and employee related costs realized from these actions approximate $11 million. These charges were offset by reversals of severance and employee related accruals totaling $1 million due to refinements in estimates, recovery of $4 million from the settlement of a commercial dispute pertaining to prior billings with an information technology vendor and gains of $1 million on sales of owned facilities identified for closure in prior restructuring charges. See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges (Recoveries), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Provision for income taxes $ 129,460 115,513 76,916 12 % 50 Effective tax rate 36.3% 34.9% 36.2% The 2005 effective tax rate includes a tax benefit of $8 million associated with the State of Ohio enacted tax legislation, which phases out the Ohio corporate franchise (income) tax and phases in a new gross receipts tax called the Commercial Activity Tax (CAT) over a five year period. While the corporate franchise (income) tax was generally based on federal taxable income, the CAT is based on current year sales and rentals in Ohio. As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the elimination of Ohios corporate franchise (income) tax over the next five years resulted in a favorable adjustment to deferred income taxes. The 2004 effective tax rate includes a net tax benefit of $9 million associated with the completion of the audit of our federal income tax returns for the 1995 to 1997 period, partially offset by provisions made for loss contingencies related to the 1998 through 2000 period. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS represents those costs incurred to support all of our business segments, including sales and marketing, human resources, finance, corporate services, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each of our business segments and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, corporate communications, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at approximate fair value as if the transactions were made with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) is included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer, and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 15,860 14,971 15,319 Dedicated Contract Carriage 16,800 17,757 18,267 Total $ 32,660 32,728 33,586 Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2005 versus 2004 Total revenue grew in 2005 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue for 2005 increased as a result of higher commercial rental and contract related maintenance revenue and the impact of acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $21 million of total additional revenue in 2005. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2005 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.6%. Full service lease revenue increased in 2005 primarily from the acquisition completed in March 2004 and growth in Canada as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) acquisitions) in the first half of 2005. Our U.S. business showed improved revenue growth trends in the second half of 2005 as a result of positive net sales. In 2006, we expect growth in full service lease revenue due to recent sales activity and improving retention results. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we also restructured our FMS operations to better service customers and drive future growth in full service lease. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue, which generally represents ancillary services supporting core product lines, benefited from ongoing initiatives aimed at growing these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of stronger pricing and revenue contributions attributed to the acquisition completed in March 2004. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue to improve in 2006 based on improved pricing discipline. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates approximately 85% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 296,435 292,241 252,968 1% 16 Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 284,187 257,828 206,653 10% 25 Average commercial rental fleet size(2) 36,500 36,000 32,800 1% 10 Average commercial rental power fleet size (2),(3) 26,100 25,000 22,900 4% 9 Commercial rental utilization 74.6% 76.9% 72.1% (230) bps 480 bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT grew $42 million in 2005 as a result of improved commercial rental results from higher pricing, higher gains on disposal of used vehicles resulting from stronger volume and pricing, and lower overhead costs, including performance based incentive compensation. 2004 versus 2003 Total revenue grew in 2004 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices and higher volumes attributed to acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $177 million of revenue in 2004. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2004 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. Full service lease revenue increased in 2004 primarily from acquisitions that added approximately 7,000 vehicles to our lease fleet. Comparisons were also favorably impacted by higher revenue in Canada and the U.K. as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) as a result of weak leasing demand in 2003 and flat net sales in 2004. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue increased due to initiatives implemented to drive growth in these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of higher rental pricing and utilization in each of our markets and a 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) larger fleet size. Commercial rental revenue in 2004 also benefited from revenue contributions attributed to acquisitions. FMS NBT grew $118 million in 2004 as a result of the acquisitions that allowed us to leverage our existing infrastructure, improved commercial rental results from higher rental pricing and utilization, higher gains on disposal of used revenue earning equipment from stronger pricing and volume, and lower pension costs. The impact of these items was partially offset by lower full service lease and contract maintenance revenue in our base business (excluding acquired contracts). Our global fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment and contract maintenance vehicles is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ Number of Units 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 End of period count By type: Trucks 63,200 63,700 62,400 (1 )% 2 Tractors 52,700 51,700 48,900 2 6 Trailers 40,600 43,100 43,200 (6 ) Other 5,800 5,900 5,700 (2 ) 4 Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 By product line: Full service lease 118,400 119,700 118,900 (1 )% 1 Commercial rental 40,500 41,700 38,500 (3 ) 8 Service and other vehicles 3,400 3,000 2,800 13 7 Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 Owned(1) 156,500 157,000 150,200 % 5 Leased 5,800 7,400 10,000 (22 ) (26 ) Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 Full year average 164,900 164,300 160,000 % 3 Customer vehicles under contract maintenance (end of period) 26,400 28,500 29,000 (7 )% (2 ) (1) Effective March 1, 2004, approximately 6,400 units were added to the fleet as part of the Ruan acquisition. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. NLE units represent vehicles held for sale, as well as vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. These vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to the higher level of lease vehicle replacement and increased out servicing activity of rental vehicles. In 2006, we expect the number of NLE units to remain at the current levels.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was primarily due to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation, is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2005, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect revenue improvements to continue over the near term. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of the year. 2004 versus 2003 SCS total revenue and operating revenue declined in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain U.S. and international customer contracts. Additionally, international operating revenue in 2003 included $21 million associated with an inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. The unfavorable operating revenue comparisons were partially offset by new contract start ups and expansions in the U.S., Canada and Latin America and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Both SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. In 2004, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 30% of SCS total revenue and 19% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT declined $3 million in 2004 primarily due to lower operating revenue partially offset by reduced overhead spending resulting from continued profit improvement actions. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 DCC total and operating revenue decreased in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain customer contracts, partially offset by the pass through of higher average fuel prices. DCC NBT declined $6 million in 2004 as a result of lower revenue, increased driver costs and higher safety and insurance expenses, partially offset by lower overhead spending. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarters facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarters relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. We expect reductions in CSS spending levels over the near term based on continuing cost containment and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 Total CSS costs decreased in 2004 as a result of ongoing cost containment and process improvement actions, most notably in information technology (IT). This decrease was partially offset by higher performance based incentive compensation costs attributed to the improved overall performance. Technology costs were lower in 2004 due primarily to reduced pricing on purchased IT services. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2004 largely due to Sarbanes Oxley compliance costs that were not allocated to the business segments and higher performance based incentive compensation. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Financing activities 241,505 (195,760 ) (232,796 ) Investing activities (988,855 ) (720,113 ) (543,165 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (3,956 ) 9,368 8,738 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 27,756 (39,656 ) 36,390 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to improved operating performance and the add back of depreciation expense attributed to VIEs that were consolidated effective July 1, 2003. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Cash used in financing activities decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher debt borrowings and proceeds from stock option exercises were partially offset by increased stock repurchases. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher capital expenditures, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. Cash used in investing activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due to higher capital expenditures and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions. Capital expenditures increased in 2004 due to planned higher levels of vehicle replacements for equipment under lease to our customers and new lease sales. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions completed during 2004. We manage our business to maximize operating cash flows and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities as free cash flow. Although free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure, we consider it to be an important measure of comparative operating performance. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Collections on direct finance leases 70,408 63,795 61,368 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,963 42,839 13,392 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,752 288,674 196,198 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 13,181 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) (734,509 ) Acquisitions (15,110 ) (148,791 ) (96,518 ) Other, net 21,511 6,995 3,723 Free cash flow $ (209,793 ) 146,736 260,448 We used $210 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $147 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) offset by lower acquisition spending. Free cash flow decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher capital spending and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions offset better operating performance, higher proceeds from sales of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions. Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow comparisons in the first half of 2004 were also positively impacted by the add back of depreciation expense of approximately $40 million attributed to VIEs that were consolidated as a result of the adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. We anticipate negative free cash flow levels to improve in 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower income tax payments. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,082,332 862,994 459,239 Commercial rental 251,278 241,858 219,880 1,333,610 1,104,852 679,119 Operating property and equipment 77,360 59,767 46,011 Total capital expenditures 1,410,970 1,164,619 725,130 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (11,591 ) (72,461 ) 9,379 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,399,379 1,092,158 734,509 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $0.4 million, $54 million and $67 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures grew in 2005 and 2004 due primarily to increased replacement activity in our full service lease business. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels should be relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. As a result of our fleet age and anticipated higher levels of new sales and replacement activity, total capital expenditures are anticipated to increase to approximately $1.6 billion in 2006, including lease vehicle replacements of approximately $1.1 billion and spending for anticipated incremental lease growth of approximately $200 million. We expect to fund 2006 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In both 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Ryder completed two acquisitions related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $15 million in 2005, $149 million in 2004 and $97 million in 2003. Approximately $4 million is due to the sellers at December 31, 2005 and will be paid subject to holdback 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) provisions set forth in the purchase agreements. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2006. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 1,783,216 1,815,900 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 188,271 79,033 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 600,000 135,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 162,124 147,153 Retirement of debentures (200,000 ) (72,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (343,933 ) (384,932 ) 406,462 (95,746 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (4,152 ) (9,380 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 433 54,094 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (593 ) 18,348 Total changes in debt 402,150 (32,684 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 32% at December 31, 2005, compared with 37% at December 31, 2004. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2005 Equity 2004 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,185,366 143% $ 1,783,216 118% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 117,062 161,138 Total obligations $ 2,302,428 151% $ 1,944,354 129% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total shareholders equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total shareholders equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess Ryders overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2005 was driven by our increased funding needs as a result of higher vehicle capital spending requirements, higher income tax payments and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A downgrade of Ryders debt rating below investment grade level would limit our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2005 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility is used primarily to finance working capital internationally and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. The credit facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no facility supported letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. During May 2005, the terms of the credit facility were amended thereby extending the expiration of the facility one year to 2010 and reducing the current annual facility fee from 15.0 basis points to 11.0 basis points. The annual facility fee applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2005 was 128%. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, we repaid $200 million of debentures. In September 2005, Ryder filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that were carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. The universal shelf registration statement became effective in November 2005. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) December 31, 2005, Ryder had $800 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder System, Inc., entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is similar to Ryders previous accounts receivable facility, which expired in December 2004, except that this program will be a 364 day facility. This program will be accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which would cause early termination, the program will expire on September 12, 2006, unless extended by the parties. At December 31, 2005, no receivables were sold pursuant to the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2005, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 474 Shelf registration statement 800 Trade receivables facility 200 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans and insurance companies) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be VIEs. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale and operating leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from such sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. These leases contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We did not enter into any sale and operating leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2003. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $16 million and $26 million, respectively, and we have accrued $3 million as a corresponding liability. See Note 17, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2005: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 268,716 438,880 865,837 610,113 2,183,546 Capital lease obligations 722 871 171 56 1,820 Total debt 269,438 439,751 866,008 610,169 2,185,366 Interest on debt(1) 113,332 174,251 120,934 223,016 631,533 Operating leases(2) 102,474 132,255 62,538 66,067 363,334 Purchase obligations(3) 28,794 33,543 8,975 71,312 Total contractual cash obligations 244,600 340,049 192,447 289,083 1,066,179 Insurance obligations(4) 111,163 99,107 40,156 52,814 303,240 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 13,115 1,001 17,104 31,220 Total $ 625,201 892,022 1,099,612 969,170 3,586,005 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2005. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to information technology services. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were derivative contracts, deferred compensation obligations and legal contractual obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2006, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $71 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2006 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $115 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In connection with the accrual of the additional minimum pension liability, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $221 million and $189 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which increased at December 31, 2005 as reductions in discount rates offset the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 7% in 2005. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may, from time to time, make voluntary contributions to our pension plans. During 2005, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $12 million compared with $70 million in 2004. After considering the 2005 contributions, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $115 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. Share Repurchases and Cash Dividends In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. At December 31, 2005, we had repurchased and retired approximately 2.6 million shares under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $109 million. Management has established a prearranged written plan under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allows for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We expect to complete the October 2005 program in the first quarter of 2006. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through employee stock purchase plans since May 1, 2004, which totaled approximately 2.4 million shares at December 31, 2005. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan under Rule 10b5 1 as part of the July 2004 program. In 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate, in part, the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003 up to $90 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the 2003 program. In 2004 and 2003, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million and 117,500 shares, respectively, under the 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million and $3 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $41 million in 2005, $39 million in 2004 and $38 million in 2003. During 2005, we increased our annual dividend to $0.64 per share of common stock. In February 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.16 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2005. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 16, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.5 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement totaled $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% and a fair value of $1.2 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2004 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $13 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements totaled $0.8 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $607 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $285 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2004 totaled $5 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2006 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $10 million and $16 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.1 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $9 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2005, we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004 and $1 million in 2003. We incurred environmental expenses of $9 million, $10 million and $12 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2005 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2005, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2006, which will cause depreciation expense in 2006 to decrease by approximately $13 million compared with 2005. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2006 by approximately $85 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2005, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $5 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2006 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 76% equity securities and 24% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an unrecognized loss of $428 million at the end of 2005 compared with a loss of $371 million at the end of 2004. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2005 results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and assets earning a rate of return below the assumed rates offset in part by the amortization of the opening balance. To the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. The amount of the unrecognized loss subject to amortization in 2006 will be $281 million. The effect on years beyond 2006 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2005 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2006 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2006 Net December 31, 2005 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.90% + 0.25% $5 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.90% 0.25% + $5 million + $41 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $2 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2005, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2006 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2005, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $156 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, in certain instances (typically when we manage transportation for our customers), we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis. In transportation management contracts where we act as an agent, we have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. In addition, we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments. During 2005, we entered into a significant SCS managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as principal in the arrangement. As a result, we recognized an additional $135 million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in 2005 by reporting revenue on a gross basis. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $235 million and $257 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. The amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at December 31, 2004 and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Share Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of SFAS No. 123R would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax benefits and headquarters complex sale. We believe that the comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contributed to the increases in operating expense in 2005 and 2004. For 2004, operating expense was also impacted by higher maintenance costs, resulting from a larger and older vehicle fleet, and added operating costs attributed to the FMS acquisitions. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $ 1,262,160 1,233,038 1,242,930 2 % (1 ) Percentage of revenue 22% 24% 26% Salaries and employee related costs grew for 2005 compared with 2004 as a result of headcount added to support the growth in our SCS business segment, which was offset slightly by reduced performance based incentive compensation and lower employee benefit costs. Average headcount increased 2% in 2005 compared with 2004. The number of employees at December 31, 2005 increased 6% to approximately 27,800, compared with 26,300 at December 31, 2004, primarily due to the growth in our SCS business segment. Pension expense decreased $4 million in 2005 to $59 million compared with 2004 and principally impacted FMS. The decrease in pension expense reflects the positive impact of higher actual pension asset returns in 2004. We expect pension expense on a pre tax basis to increase approximately $9 million to $68 million in 2006. Our 2006 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. The anticipated increase in pension expense would primarily impact our FMS business segment. Salaries and employee related costs decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as a result of lower pension expense and lower headcount in our SCS and DCC business segments caused by the non renewal of certain contracts, offset in part by higher performance based incentive compensation. Average headcount decreased 1% in 2004 compared with 2003. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $ 638,319 424,991 414,284 50 % 3 Percentage of revenue 11% 8% 9% Subcontracted transportation represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. During 2005, subcontracted transportation expense in our SCS business segment grew due to increased volumes of freight management activity from new and expanded business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs, resulting from increased fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation expense increased in 2004 compared with 2003 principally as a result of added transportation management based business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs resulting from increased fuel costs. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $ 740,415 706,028 624,580 5 % 13 Gains on vehicle sales, net (47,098 ) (34,504 ) (15,780 ) 37 119 Equipment rental 102,816 108,468 200,868 (5 ) (46 ) 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. The growth in depreciation expense during 2005 is due to higher vehicle replacement activity within our truck and tractor fleets as well as the conversion of leased vehicles to owned status, partially offset by a decline in our average trailer fleet size. The growth in depreciation expense during 2004 reflected the consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003 (approximately $40 million), the impact of vehicles added as part of the FMS acquisitions, the conversion of leased units to owned status as a result of lease extensions and the replacement of expiring leased units with owned units. The improvements in gains on vehicle sales in 2005 and 2004 were due to an increase in the number of units sold combined with improved average pricing on vehicles sold over the preceding periods. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in losses on sales. Equipment rental primarily consists of rental costs on revenue earning equipment in FMS. The decrease in equipment rental in 2005 from 2004 is due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles when compared with 2004. The significant decrease in 2004 compared with 2003 was due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles (compared with owned) resulting from the consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003 (approximately $50 million), the conversion of leased units to owned status as a result of lease extensions and the replacement of expiring leased units with owned units. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $ 120,474 100,114 96,169 20% 4 Effective interest rate 5.6% 5.5% 5.8% Interest expense grew in 2005 reflecting higher average debt levels, resulting from increased capital spending, income tax payments and share repurchases. The growth in interest expense in 2004 over 2003 reflects higher average debt levels, including debt of consolidated VIEs. Excluding interest expense from consolidated VIEs, comparisons for 2004 were favorably impacted by overall lower market interest rates and reduced effective interest rates as a result of hedging transactions, which principally benefited FMS. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Miscellaneous income, net $ (8,944 ) (6,625 ) (12,158 ) 35% (46 ) Miscellaneous income, net consists of investment income on securities used to fund certain benefit plans, interest income and other non operating items. Prior to the consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003, miscellaneous income, net also included servicing fee income for administrative services provided to vehicle lease trusts in connection with vehicle securitization transactions. Miscellaneous income, net increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to the one time recovery of $3 million for project costs incurred in prior years and better market performance of investments classified as trading securities used to fund certain benefit plans. Miscellaneous income, net decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 because of 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the elimination of servicing fee income related to certain VIEs. As a result of consolidating the vehicle securitization trusts, we no longer recognize service fee income. Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Restructuring and other charges (recoveries), net $ 3,376 (17,676 ) (230 ) 2005 Activity During 2005, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other charges of $3 million that consisted of employee severance and benefits, contract termination costs, and closure of leased facilities partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter and related primarily to the restructuring of our U.K. operations, and the offshoring of some administrative finance and support functions that will allow for future cost savings. We expect to realize annual pre tax cost savings of approximately $7 million from the 2005 fourth quarter actions, which are expected to be completed in the second half of 2006. During 2005, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 160 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in Ryders domestic and international FMS and SCS business segments and Central Support Services (CSS). The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $3 million. Cost reductions associated with these actions will benefit salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Many of the eliminated positions in our domestic operations were impacted by Ryders decision to outsource certain administrative finance functions to lower cost foreign providers and maximize our technology resources. Transition actions will begin in February 2006 and continue through the remainder of 2006. We also closed two administrative offices in the U.S. as a result of the restructuring of our FMS domestic business operations and recorded a charge for future cash payments related to lease obligations. As part of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions, Ryder management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced telecommunication services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 2010. In accordance with the terms of the services agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling nearly $1 million for contract termination costs. The transition activities are expected to be completed in the first half of 2006 and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services will benefit operating expenses starting in the latter part of 2006. These charges were partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals due to refinements in estimates. 2004 Activity During 2004, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other recoveries of $18 million that consisted of gains from the sale of the previous headquarters complex and reversals of severance and employee related accruals partially offset by contract termination costs. During 2004, we recognized $24 million in gains from properties sold in connection with the relocation of our headquarters. In May 2004, we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters facility for $39 million in cash and recognized a $22 million gain from the sale. In conjunction with this sale, we entered into a lease agreement with the purchaser to lease back the headquarters facility until we relocated to our new headquarters in April 2005. Also during 2004, we recognized gains totaling $2 million from the sale of properties ancillary to our main headquarters facility. In 2004, as part of ongoing cost containment initiatives, Ryder management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced information technology infrastructure services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2010. In accordance with the terms of the services agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling $8 million for contract termination ($6 million) and transition costs incurred since termination ($2 million). By December 31, 2004, all transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses starting in 2005. 2003 Activity During 2003, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 140 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in Ryders FMS and SCS business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $6 million. While many of these employees had not been terminated by December 31, 2003, such actions were substantially finalized by March 31, 2004. Estimated annual pre tax cost savings in salaries and employee related costs realized from these actions approximate $11 million. These charges were offset by reversals of severance and employee related accruals totaling $1 million due to refinements in estimates, recovery of $4 million from the settlement of a commercial dispute pertaining to prior billings with an information technology vendor and gains of $1 million on sales of owned facilities identified for closure in prior restructuring charges. See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges (Recoveries), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Provision for income taxes $ 129,460 115,513 76,916 12 % 50 Effective tax rate 36.3% 34.9% 36.2% The 2005 effective tax rate includes a tax benefit of $8 million associated with the State of Ohio enacted tax legislation, which phases out the Ohio corporate franchise (income) tax and phases in a new gross receipts tax called the Commercial Activity Tax (CAT) over a five year period. While the corporate franchise (income) tax was generally based on federal taxable income, the CAT is based on current year sales and rentals in Ohio. As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the elimination of Ohios corporate franchise (income) tax over the next five years resulted in a favorable adjustment to deferred income taxes. The 2004 effective tax rate includes a net tax benefit of $9 million associated with the completion of the audit of our federal income tax returns for the 1995 to 1997 period, partially offset by provisions made for loss contingencies related to the 1998 through 2000 period. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS represents those costs incurred to support all of our business segments, including sales and marketing, human resources, finance, corporate services, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each of our business segments and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, corporate communications, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at approximate fair value as if the transactions were made with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) is included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer, and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 15,860 14,971 15,319 Dedicated Contract Carriage 16,800 17,757 18,267 Total $ 32,660 32,728 33,586 Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2005 versus 2004 Total revenue grew in 2005 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue for 2005 increased as a result of higher commercial rental and contract related maintenance revenue and the impact of acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $21 million of total additional revenue in 2005. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2005 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.6%. Full service lease revenue increased in 2005 primarily from the acquisition completed in March 2004 and growth in Canada as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) acquisitions) in the first half of 2005. Our U.S. business showed improved revenue growth trends in the second half of 2005 as a result of positive net sales. In 2006, we expect growth in full service lease revenue due to recent sales activity and improving retention results. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we also restructured our FMS operations to better service customers and drive future growth in full service lease. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue, which generally represents ancillary services supporting core product lines, benefited from ongoing initiatives aimed at growing these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of stronger pricing and revenue contributions attributed to the acquisition completed in March 2004. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue to improve in 2006 based on improved pricing discipline. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates approximately 85% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 296,435 292,241 252,968 1% 16 Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 284,187 257,828 206,653 10% 25 Average commercial rental fleet size(2) 36,500 36,000 32,800 1% 10 Average commercial rental power fleet size (2),(3) 26,100 25,000 22,900 4% 9 Commercial rental utilization 74.6% 76.9% 72.1% (230) bps 480 bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT grew $42 million in 2005 as a result of improved commercial rental results from higher pricing, higher gains on disposal of used vehicles resulting from stronger volume and pricing, and lower overhead costs, including performance based incentive compensation. 2004 versus 2003 Total revenue grew in 2004 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices and higher volumes attributed to acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $177 million of revenue in 2004. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2004 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. Full service lease revenue increased in 2004 primarily from acquisitions that added approximately 7,000 vehicles to our lease fleet. Comparisons were also favorably impacted by higher revenue in Canada and the U.K. as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) as a result of weak leasing demand in 2003 and flat net sales in 2004. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue increased due to initiatives implemented to drive growth in these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of higher rental pricing and utilization in each of our markets and a 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) larger fleet size. Commercial rental revenue in 2004 also benefited from revenue contributions attributed to acquisitions. FMS NBT grew $118 million in 2004 as a result of the acquisitions that allowed us to leverage our existing infrastructure, improved commercial rental results from higher rental pricing and utilization, higher gains on disposal of used revenue earning equipment from stronger pricing and volume, and lower pension costs. The impact of these items was partially offset by lower full service lease and contract maintenance revenue in our base business (excluding acquired contracts). Our global fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment and contract maintenance vehicles is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ Number of Units 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 End of period count By type: Trucks 63,200 63,700 62,400 (1 )% 2 Tractors 52,700 51,700 48,900 2 6 Trailers 40,600 43,100 43,200 (6 ) Other 5,800 5,900 5,700 (2 ) 4 Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 By product line: Full service lease 118,400 119,700 118,900 (1 )% 1 Commercial rental 40,500 41,700 38,500 (3 ) 8 Service and other vehicles 3,400 3,000 2,800 13 7 Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 Owned(1) 156,500 157,000 150,200 % 5 Leased 5,800 7,400 10,000 (22 ) (26 ) Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 Full year average 164,900 164,300 160,000 % 3 Customer vehicles under contract maintenance (end of period) 26,400 28,500 29,000 (7 )% (2 ) (1) Effective March 1, 2004, approximately 6,400 units were added to the fleet as part of the Ruan acquisition. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The totals in the table above include the following non revenue earning equipment for the U.S. fleet (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): December 31 Number of Units 2005 2004 Change Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 1,700 1,900 (11 )% No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale 4,700 4,800 (2 ) Other NLE units 2,200 1,600 38 Total(1) 8,600 8,300 4 % (1) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,500 vehicles in 2005 and 2004, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. NLE units represent vehicles held for sale, as well as vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. These vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to the higher level of lease vehicle replacement and increased out servicing activity of rental vehicles. In 2006, we expect the number of NLE units to remain at the current levels.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was primarily due to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation, is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2005, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect revenue improvements to continue over the near term. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of the year. 2004 versus 2003 SCS total revenue and operating revenue declined in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain U.S. and international customer contracts. Additionally, international operating revenue in 2003 included $21 million associated with an inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. The unfavorable operating revenue comparisons were partially offset by new contract start ups and expansions in the U.S., Canada and Latin America and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Both SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. In 2004, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 30% of SCS total revenue and 19% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT declined $3 million in 2004 primarily due to lower operating revenue partially offset by reduced overhead spending resulting from continued profit improvement actions. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 DCC total and operating revenue decreased in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain customer contracts, partially offset by the pass through of higher average fuel prices. DCC NBT declined $6 million in 2004 as a result of lower revenue, increased driver costs and higher safety and insurance expenses, partially offset by lower overhead spending. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarters facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarters relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. We expect reductions in CSS spending levels over the near term based on continuing cost containment and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 Total CSS costs decreased in 2004 as a result of ongoing cost containment and process improvement actions, most notably in information technology (IT). This decrease was partially offset by higher performance based incentive compensation costs attributed to the improved overall performance. Technology costs were lower in 2004 due primarily to reduced pricing on purchased IT services. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2004 largely due to Sarbanes Oxley compliance costs that were not allocated to the business segments and higher performance based incentive compensation. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Financing activities 241,505 (195,760 ) (232,796 ) Investing activities (988,855 ) (720,113 ) (543,165 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (3,956 ) 9,368 8,738 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 27,756 (39,656 ) 36,390 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to improved operating performance and the add back of depreciation expense attributed to VIEs that were consolidated effective July 1, 2003. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Cash used in financing activities decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher debt borrowings and proceeds from stock option exercises were partially offset by increased stock repurchases. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher capital expenditures, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. Cash used in investing activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due to higher capital expenditures and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions. Capital expenditures increased in 2004 due to planned higher levels of vehicle replacements for equipment under lease to our customers and new lease sales. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions completed during 2004. We manage our business to maximize operating cash flows and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities as free cash flow. Although free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure, we consider it to be an important measure of comparative operating performance. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Collections on direct finance leases 70,408 63,795 61,368 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,963 42,839 13,392 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,752 288,674 196,198 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 13,181 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) (734,509 ) Acquisitions (15,110 ) (148,791 ) (96,518 ) Other, net 21,511 6,995 3,723 Free cash flow $ (209,793 ) 146,736 260,448 We used $210 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $147 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) offset by lower acquisition spending. Free cash flow decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher capital spending and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions offset better operating performance, higher proceeds from sales of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions. Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow comparisons in the first half of 2004 were also positively impacted by the add back of depreciation expense of approximately $40 million attributed to VIEs that were consolidated as a result of the adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. We anticipate negative free cash flow levels to improve in 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower income tax payments. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,082,332 862,994 459,239 Commercial rental 251,278 241,858 219,880 1,333,610 1,104,852 679,119 Operating property and equipment 77,360 59,767 46,011 Total capital expenditures 1,410,970 1,164,619 725,130 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (11,591 ) (72,461 ) 9,379 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,399,379 1,092,158 734,509 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $0.4 million, $54 million and $67 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures grew in 2005 and 2004 due primarily to increased replacement activity in our full service lease business. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels should be relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. As a result of our fleet age and anticipated higher levels of new sales and replacement activity, total capital expenditures are anticipated to increase to approximately $1.6 billion in 2006, including lease vehicle replacements of approximately $1.1 billion and spending for anticipated incremental lease growth of approximately $200 million. We expect to fund 2006 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In both 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Ryder completed two acquisitions related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $15 million in 2005, $149 million in 2004 and $97 million in 2003. Approximately $4 million is due to the sellers at December 31, 2005 and will be paid subject to holdback 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) provisions set forth in the purchase agreements. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2006. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 1,783,216 1,815,900 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 188,271 79,033 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 600,000 135,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 162,124 147,153 Retirement of debentures (200,000 ) (72,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (343,933 ) (384,932 ) 406,462 (95,746 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (4,152 ) (9,380 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 433 54,094 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (593 ) 18,348 Total changes in debt 402,150 (32,684 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 32% at December 31, 2005, compared with 37% at December 31, 2004. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2005 Equity 2004 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,185,366 143% $ 1,783,216 118% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 117,062 161,138 Total obligations $ 2,302,428 151% $ 1,944,354 129% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total shareholders equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total shareholders equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess Ryders overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2005 was driven by our increased funding needs as a result of higher vehicle capital spending requirements, higher income tax payments and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A downgrade of Ryders debt rating below investment grade level would limit our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2005 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility is used primarily to finance working capital internationally and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. The credit facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no facility supported letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. During May 2005, the terms of the credit facility were amended thereby extending the expiration of the facility one year to 2010 and reducing the current annual facility fee from 15.0 basis points to 11.0 basis points. The annual facility fee applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2005 was 128%. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, we repaid $200 million of debentures. In September 2005, Ryder filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that were carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. The universal shelf registration statement became effective in November 2005. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) December 31, 2005, Ryder had $800 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder System, Inc., entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is similar to Ryders previous accounts receivable facility, which expired in December 2004, except that this program will be a 364 day facility. This program will be accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which would cause early termination, the program will expire on September 12, 2006, unless extended by the parties. At December 31, 2005, no receivables were sold pursuant to the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2005, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 474 Shelf registration statement 800 Trade receivables facility 200 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans and insurance companies) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be VIEs. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale and operating leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from such sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. These leases contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We did not enter into any sale and operating leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2003. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $16 million and $26 million, respectively, and we have accrued $3 million as a corresponding liability. See Note 17, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2005: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 268,716 438,880 865,837 610,113 2,183,546 Capital lease obligations 722 871 171 56 1,820 Total debt 269,438 439,751 866,008 610,169 2,185,366 Interest on debt(1) 113,332 174,251 120,934 223,016 631,533 Operating leases(2) 102,474 132,255 62,538 66,067 363,334 Purchase obligations(3) 28,794 33,543 8,975 71,312 Total contractual cash obligations 244,600 340,049 192,447 289,083 1,066,179 Insurance obligations(4) 111,163 99,107 40,156 52,814 303,240 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 13,115 1,001 17,104 31,220 Total $ 625,201 892,022 1,099,612 969,170 3,586,005 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2005. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to information technology services. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were derivative contracts, deferred compensation obligations and legal contractual obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2006, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $71 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2006 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $115 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In connection with the accrual of the additional minimum pension liability, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $221 million and $189 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which increased at December 31, 2005 as reductions in discount rates offset the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 7% in 2005. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may, from time to time, make voluntary contributions to our pension plans. During 2005, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $12 million compared with $70 million in 2004. After considering the 2005 contributions, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $115 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. Share Repurchases and Cash Dividends In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. At December 31, 2005, we had repurchased and retired approximately 2.6 million shares under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $109 million. Management has established a prearranged written plan under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allows for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We expect to complete the October 2005 program in the first quarter of 2006. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through employee stock purchase plans since May 1, 2004, which totaled approximately 2.4 million shares at December 31, 2005. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan under Rule 10b5 1 as part of the July 2004 program. In 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate, in part, the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003 up to $90 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the 2003 program. In 2004 and 2003, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million and 117,500 shares, respectively, under the 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million and $3 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $41 million in 2005, $39 million in 2004 and $38 million in 2003. During 2005, we increased our annual dividend to $0.64 per share of common stock. In February 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.16 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2005. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 16, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.5 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement totaled $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% and a fair value of $1.2 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2004 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $13 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements totaled $0.8 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $607 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $285 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2004 totaled $5 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2006 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $10 million and $16 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.1 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $9 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2005, we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004 and $1 million in 2003. We incurred environmental expenses of $9 million, $10 million and $12 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2005 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2005, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2006, which will cause depreciation expense in 2006 to decrease by approximately $13 million compared with 2005. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2006 by approximately $85 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2005, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $5 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2006 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 76% equity securities and 24% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an unrecognized loss of $428 million at the end of 2005 compared with a loss of $371 million at the end of 2004. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2005 results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and assets earning a rate of return below the assumed rates offset in part by the amortization of the opening balance. To the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. The amount of the unrecognized loss subject to amortization in 2006 will be $281 million. The effect on years beyond 2006 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2005 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2006 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2006 Net December 31, 2005 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.90% + 0.25% $5 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.90% 0.25% + $5 million + $41 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $2 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2005, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2006 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2005, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $156 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, in certain instances (typically when we manage transportation for our customers), we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis. In transportation management contracts where we act as an agent, we have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. In addition, we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments. During 2005, we entered into a significant SCS managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as principal in the arrangement. As a result, we recognized an additional $135 million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in 2005 by reporting revenue on a gross basis. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $235 million and $257 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. The amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at December 31, 2004 and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Share Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of SFAS No. 123R would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax benefits and headquarters complex sale. We believe that the comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Forward looking statements (within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) are statements that relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends concerning matters that are not historical facts.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. The growth in depreciation expense during 2005 is due to higher vehicle replacement activity within our truck and tractor fleets as well as the conversion of leased vehicles to owned status, partially offset by a decline in our average trailer fleet size. The growth in depreciation expense during 2004 reflected the consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003 (approximately $40 million), the impact of vehicles added as part of the FMS acquisitions, the conversion of leased units to owned status as a result of lease extensions and the replacement of expiring leased units with owned units. The improvements in gains on vehicle sales in 2005 and 2004 were due to an increase in the number of units sold combined with improved average pricing on vehicles sold over the preceding periods. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in losses on sales. Equipment rental primarily consists of rental costs on revenue earning equipment in FMS. The decrease in equipment rental in 2005 from 2004 is due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles when compared with 2004. The significant decrease in 2004 compared with 2003 was due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles (compared with owned) resulting from the consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003 (approximately $50 million), the conversion of leased units to owned status as a result of lease extensions and the replacement of expiring leased units with owned units.

The growth in interest expense in 2004 over 2003 reflects higher average debt levels, including debt of consolidated VIEs. Excluding interest expense from consolidated VIEs, comparisons for 2004 were favorably impacted by overall lower market interest rates and reduced effective interest rates as a result of hedging transactions, which principally benefited FMS. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Miscellaneous income, net $ (8,944 ) (6,625 ) (12,158 ) 35% (46 ) Miscellaneous income, net consists of investment income on securities used to fund certain benefit plans, interest income and other non operating items. Prior to the consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003, miscellaneous income, net also included servicing fee income for administrative services provided to vehicle lease trusts in connection with vehicle securitization transactions. Miscellaneous income, net increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to the one time recovery of $3 million for project costs incurred in prior years and better market performance of investments classified as trading securities used to fund certain benefit plans. Miscellaneous income, net decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 because of 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the elimination of servicing fee income related to certain VIEs. As a result of consolidating the vehicle securitization trusts, we no longer recognize service fee income. Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Restructuring and other charges (recoveries), net $ 3,376 (17,676 ) (230 ) 2005 Activity During 2005, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other charges of $3 million that consisted of employee severance and benefits, contract termination costs, and closure of leased facilities partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter and related primarily to the restructuring of our U.K. operations, and the offshoring of some administrative finance and support functions that will allow for future cost savings. We expect to realize annual pre tax cost savings of approximately $7 million from the 2005 fourth quarter actions, which are expected to be completed in the second half of 2006. During 2005, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 160 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in Ryders domestic and international FMS and SCS business segments and Central Support Services (CSS). The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $3 million. Cost reductions associated with these actions will benefit salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Many of the eliminated positions in our domestic operations were impacted by Ryders decision to outsource certain administrative finance functions to lower cost foreign providers and maximize our technology resources. Transition actions will begin in February 2006 and continue through the remainder of 2006. We also closed two administrative offices in the U.S. as a result of the restructuring of our FMS domestic business operations and recorded a charge for future cash payments related to lease obligations. As part of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions, Ryder management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced telecommunication services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 2010. In accordance with the terms of the services agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling nearly $1 million for contract termination costs. The transition activities are expected to be completed in the first half of 2006 and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services will benefit operating expenses starting in the latter part of 2006. These charges were partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals due to refinements in estimates. 2004 Activity During 2004, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other recoveries of $18 million that consisted of gains from the sale of the previous headquarters complex and reversals of severance and employee related accruals partially offset by contract termination costs. During 2004, we recognized $24 million in gains from properties sold in connection with the relocation of our headquarters. In May 2004, we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters facility for $39 million in cash and recognized a $22 million gain from the sale. In conjunction with this sale, we entered into a lease agreement with the purchaser to lease back the headquarters facility until we relocated to our new headquarters in April 2005. Also during 2004, we recognized gains totaling $2 million from the sale of properties ancillary to our main headquarters facility. In 2004, as part of ongoing cost containment initiatives, Ryder management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced information technology infrastructure services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2010. In accordance with the terms of the services agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling $8 million for contract termination ($6 million) and transition costs incurred since termination ($2 million). By December 31, 2004, all transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses starting in 2005. 2003 Activity During 2003, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 140 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in Ryders FMS and SCS business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $6 million. While many of these employees had not been terminated by December 31, 2003, such actions were substantially finalized by March 31, 2004. Estimated annual pre tax cost savings in salaries and employee related costs realized from these actions approximate $11 million. These charges were offset by reversals of severance and employee related accruals totaling $1 million due to refinements in estimates, recovery of $4 million from the settlement of a commercial dispute pertaining to prior billings with an information technology vendor and gains of $1 million on sales of owned facilities identified for closure in prior restructuring charges. See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges (Recoveries), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Provision for income taxes $ 129,460 115,513 76,916 12 % 50 Effective tax rate 36.3% 34.9% 36.2% The 2005 effective tax rate includes a tax benefit of $8 million associated with the State of Ohio enacted tax legislation, which phases out the Ohio corporate franchise (income) tax and phases in a new gross receipts tax called the Commercial Activity Tax (CAT) over a five year period. While the corporate franchise (income) tax was generally based on federal taxable income, the CAT is based on current year sales and rentals in Ohio. As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the elimination of Ohios corporate franchise (income) tax over the next five years resulted in a favorable adjustment to deferred income taxes. The 2004 effective tax rate includes a net tax benefit of $9 million associated with the completion of the audit of our federal income tax returns for the 1995 to 1997 period, partially offset by provisions made for loss contingencies related to the 1998 through 2000 period. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS represents those costs incurred to support all of our business segments, including sales and marketing, human resources, finance, corporate services, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each of our business segments and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, corporate communications, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at approximate fair value as if the transactions were made with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) is included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer, and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 15,860 14,971 15,319 Dedicated Contract Carriage 16,800 17,757 18,267 Total $ 32,660 32,728 33,586 Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2005 versus 2004 Total revenue grew in 2005 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue for 2005 increased as a result of higher commercial rental and contract related maintenance revenue and the impact of acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $21 million of total additional revenue in 2005. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2005 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.6%. Full service lease revenue increased in 2005 primarily from the acquisition completed in March 2004 and growth in Canada as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) acquisitions) in the first half of 2005. Our U.S. business showed improved revenue growth trends in the second half of 2005 as a result of positive net sales. In 2006, we expect growth in full service lease revenue due to recent sales activity and improving retention results. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we also restructured our FMS operations to better service customers and drive future growth in full service lease. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue, which generally represents ancillary services supporting core product lines, benefited from ongoing initiatives aimed at growing these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of stronger pricing and revenue contributions attributed to the acquisition completed in March 2004. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue to improve in 2006 based on improved pricing discipline. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates approximately 85% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 296,435 292,241 252,968 1% 16 Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 284,187 257,828 206,653 10% 25 Average commercial rental fleet size(2) 36,500 36,000 32,800 1% 10 Average commercial rental power fleet size (2),(3) 26,100 25,000 22,900 4% 9 Commercial rental utilization 74.6% 76.9% 72.1% (230) bps 480 bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT grew $42 million in 2005 as a result of improved commercial rental results from higher pricing, higher gains on disposal of used vehicles resulting from stronger volume and pricing, and lower overhead costs, including performance based incentive compensation. 2004 versus 2003 Total revenue grew in 2004 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices and higher volumes attributed to acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $177 million of revenue in 2004. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2004 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. Full service lease revenue increased in 2004 primarily from acquisitions that added approximately 7,000 vehicles to our lease fleet. Comparisons were also favorably impacted by higher revenue in Canada and the U.K. as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) as a result of weak leasing demand in 2003 and flat net sales in 2004. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue increased due to initiatives implemented to drive growth in these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of higher rental pricing and utilization in each of our markets and a 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) larger fleet size. Commercial rental revenue in 2004 also benefited from revenue contributions attributed to acquisitions. FMS NBT grew $118 million in 2004 as a result of the acquisitions that allowed us to leverage our existing infrastructure, improved commercial rental results from higher rental pricing and utilization, higher gains on disposal of used revenue earning equipment from stronger pricing and volume, and lower pension costs. The impact of these items was partially offset by lower full service lease and contract maintenance revenue in our base business (excluding acquired contracts). Our global fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment and contract maintenance vehicles is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ Number of Units 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 End of period count By type: Trucks 63,200 63,700 62,400 (1 )% 2 Tractors 52,700 51,700 48,900 2 6 Trailers 40,600 43,100 43,200 (6 ) Other 5,800 5,900 5,700 (2 ) 4 Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 By product line: Full service lease 118,400 119,700 118,900 (1 )% 1 Commercial rental 40,500 41,700 38,500 (3 ) 8 Service and other vehicles 3,400 3,000 2,800 13 7 Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 Owned(1) 156,500 157,000 150,200 % 5 Leased 5,800 7,400 10,000 (22 ) (26 ) Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 Full year average 164,900 164,300 160,000 % 3 Customer vehicles under contract maintenance (end of period) 26,400 28,500 29,000 (7 )% (2 ) (1) Effective March 1, 2004, approximately 6,400 units were added to the fleet as part of the Ruan acquisition. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. NLE units represent vehicles held for sale, as well as vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. These vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to the higher level of lease vehicle replacement and increased out servicing activity of rental vehicles. In 2006, we expect the number of NLE units to remain at the current levels.

Subcontracted transportation is deducted from total revenue to arrive at our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was primarily due to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation, is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2005, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect revenue improvements to continue over the near term. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of the year. 2004 versus 2003 SCS total revenue and operating revenue declined in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain U.S. and international customer contracts. Additionally, international operating revenue in 2003 included $21 million associated with an inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. The unfavorable operating revenue comparisons were partially offset by new contract start ups and expansions in the U.S., Canada and Latin America and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Both SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. In 2004, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 30% of SCS total revenue and 19% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT declined $3 million in 2004 primarily due to lower operating revenue partially offset by reduced overhead spending resulting from continued profit improvement actions. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is deducted from total revenue to arrive at our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 DCC total and operating revenue decreased in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain customer contracts, partially offset by the pass through of higher average fuel prices. DCC NBT declined $6 million in 2004 as a result of lower revenue, increased driver costs and higher safety and insurance expenses, partially offset by lower overhead spending. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarters facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarters relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. We expect reductions in CSS spending levels over the near term based on continuing cost containment and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 Total CSS costs decreased in 2004 as a result of ongoing cost containment and process improvement actions, most notably in information technology (IT). This decrease was partially offset by higher performance based incentive compensation costs attributed to the improved overall performance. Technology costs were lower in 2004 due primarily to reduced pricing on purchased IT services. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2004 largely due to Sarbanes Oxley compliance costs that were not allocated to the business segments and higher performance based incentive compensation. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Financing activities 241,505 (195,760 ) (232,796 ) Investing activities (988,855 ) (720,113 ) (543,165 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (3,956 ) 9,368 8,738 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 27,756 (39,656 ) 36,390 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to improved operating performance and the add back of depreciation expense attributed to VIEs that were consolidated effective July 1, 2003. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Cash used in financing activities decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher debt borrowings and proceeds from stock option exercises were partially offset by increased stock repurchases. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher capital expenditures, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. Cash used in investing activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due to higher capital expenditures and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions. Capital expenditures increased in 2004 due to planned higher levels of vehicle replacements for equipment under lease to our customers and new lease sales. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions completed during 2004. We manage our business to maximize operating cash flows and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities as free cash flow. Although free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure, we consider it to be an important measure of comparative operating performance. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Collections on direct finance leases 70,408 63,795 61,368 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,963 42,839 13,392 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,752 288,674 196,198 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 13,181 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) (734,509 ) Acquisitions (15,110 ) (148,791 ) (96,518 ) Other, net 21,511 6,995 3,723 Free cash flow $ (209,793 ) 146,736 260,448 We used $210 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $147 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) offset by lower acquisition spending. Free cash flow decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher capital spending and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions offset better operating performance, higher proceeds from sales of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions. Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow comparisons in the first half of 2004 were also positively impacted by the add back of depreciation expense of approximately $40 million attributed to VIEs that were consolidated as a result of the adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. We anticipate negative free cash flow levels to improve in 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower income tax payments. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,082,332 862,994 459,239 Commercial rental 251,278 241,858 219,880 1,333,610 1,104,852 679,119 Operating property and equipment 77,360 59,767 46,011 Total capital expenditures 1,410,970 1,164,619 725,130 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (11,591 ) (72,461 ) 9,379 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,399,379 1,092,158 734,509 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $0.4 million, $54 million and $67 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures grew in 2005 and 2004 due primarily to increased replacement activity in our full service lease business. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels should be relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. As a result of our fleet age and anticipated higher levels of new sales and replacement activity, total capital expenditures are anticipated to increase to approximately $1.6 billion in 2006, including lease vehicle replacements of approximately $1.1 billion and spending for anticipated incremental lease growth of approximately $200 million. We expect to fund 2006 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In both 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Ryder completed two acquisitions related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $15 million in 2005, $149 million in 2004 and $97 million in 2003. Approximately $4 million is due to the sellers at December 31, 2005 and will be paid subject to holdback 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) provisions set forth in the purchase agreements. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2006. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 1,783,216 1,815,900 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 188,271 79,033 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 600,000 135,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 162,124 147,153 Retirement of debentures (200,000 ) (72,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (343,933 ) (384,932 ) 406,462 (95,746 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (4,152 ) (9,380 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 433 54,094 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (593 ) 18,348 Total changes in debt 402,150 (32,684 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 32% at December 31, 2005, compared with 37% at December 31, 2004. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2005 Equity 2004 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,185,366 143% $ 1,783,216 118% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 117,062 161,138 Total obligations $ 2,302,428 151% $ 1,944,354 129% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total shareholders equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total shareholders equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess Ryders overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2005 was driven by our increased funding needs as a result of higher vehicle capital spending requirements, higher income tax payments and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A downgrade of Ryders debt rating below investment grade level would limit our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2005 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility is used primarily to finance working capital internationally and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. The credit facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no facility supported letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. During May 2005, the terms of the credit facility were amended thereby extending the expiration of the facility one year to 2010 and reducing the current annual facility fee from 15.0 basis points to 11.0 basis points. The annual facility fee applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2005 was 128%. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, we repaid $200 million of debentures. In September 2005, Ryder filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that were carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. The universal shelf registration statement became effective in November 2005. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) December 31, 2005, Ryder had $800 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder System, Inc., entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is similar to Ryders previous accounts receivable facility, which expired in December 2004, except that this program will be a 364 day facility. This program will be accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which would cause early termination, the program will expire on September 12, 2006, unless extended by the parties. At December 31, 2005, no receivables were sold pursuant to the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2005, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 474 Shelf registration statement 800 Trade receivables facility 200 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans and insurance companies) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be VIEs. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale and operating leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from such sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. These leases contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We did not enter into any sale and operating leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2003. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $16 million and $26 million, respectively, and we have accrued $3 million as a corresponding liability. See Note 17, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2005: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 268,716 438,880 865,837 610,113 2,183,546 Capital lease obligations 722 871 171 56 1,820 Total debt 269,438 439,751 866,008 610,169 2,185,366 Interest on debt(1) 113,332 174,251 120,934 223,016 631,533 Operating leases(2) 102,474 132,255 62,538 66,067 363,334 Purchase obligations(3) 28,794 33,543 8,975 71,312 Total contractual cash obligations 244,600 340,049 192,447 289,083 1,066,179 Insurance obligations(4) 111,163 99,107 40,156 52,814 303,240 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 13,115 1,001 17,104 31,220 Total $ 625,201 892,022 1,099,612 969,170 3,586,005 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2005. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to information technology services. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were derivative contracts, deferred compensation obligations and legal contractual obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2006, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $71 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2006 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $115 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In connection with the accrual of the additional minimum pension liability, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $221 million and $189 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which increased at December 31, 2005 as reductions in discount rates offset the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 7% in 2005. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may, from time to time, make voluntary contributions to our pension plans. During 2005, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $12 million compared with $70 million in 2004. After considering the 2005 contributions, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $115 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. Share Repurchases and Cash Dividends In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. At December 31, 2005, we had repurchased and retired approximately 2.6 million shares under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $109 million. Management has established a prearranged written plan under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allows for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We expect to complete the October 2005 program in the first quarter of 2006. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through employee stock purchase plans since May 1, 2004, which totaled approximately 2.4 million shares at December 31, 2005. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan under Rule 10b5 1 as part of the July 2004 program. In 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate, in part, the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003 up to $90 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the 2003 program. In 2004 and 2003, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million and 117,500 shares, respectively, under the 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million and $3 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $41 million in 2005, $39 million in 2004 and $38 million in 2003. During 2005, we increased our annual dividend to $0.64 per share of common stock. In February 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.16 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2005. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 16, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.5 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement totaled $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% and a fair value of $1.2 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2004 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $13 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements totaled $0.8 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $607 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $285 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2004 totaled $5 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2006 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $10 million and $16 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.1 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $9 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2005, we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004 and $1 million in 2003. We incurred environmental expenses of $9 million, $10 million and $12 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2005 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2005, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2006, which will cause depreciation expense in 2006 to decrease by approximately $13 million compared with 2005. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2006 by approximately $85 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2005, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $5 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2006 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 76% equity securities and 24% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an unrecognized loss of $428 million at the end of 2005 compared with a loss of $371 million at the end of 2004. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2005 results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and assets earning a rate of return below the assumed rates offset in part by the amortization of the opening balance. To the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. The amount of the unrecognized loss subject to amortization in 2006 will be $281 million. The effect on years beyond 2006 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2005 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2006 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2006 Net December 31, 2005 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.90% + 0.25% $5 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.90% 0.25% + $5 million + $41 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $2 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2005, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2006 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2005, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $156 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, in certain instances (typically when we manage transportation for our customers), we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis. In transportation management contracts where we act as an agent, we have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. In addition, we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments. During 2005, we entered into a significant SCS managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as principal in the arrangement. As a result, we recognized an additional $135 million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in 2005 by reporting revenue on a gross basis. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $235 million and $257 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. The amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at December 31, 2004 and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Share Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of SFAS No. 123R would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax benefits and headquarters complex sale. We believe that the comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the elimination of servicing fee income related to certain VIEs. As a result of consolidating the vehicle securitization trusts, we no longer recognize service fee income. Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Restructuring and other charges (recoveries), net $ 3,376 (17,676 ) (230 ) 2005 Activity During 2005, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other charges of $3 million that consisted of employee severance and benefits, contract termination costs, and closure of leased facilities partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter and related primarily to the restructuring of our U.K. operations, and the offshoring of some administrative finance and support functions that will allow for future cost savings. We expect to realize annual pre tax cost savings of approximately $7 million from the 2005 fourth quarter actions, which are expected to be completed in the second half of 2006. During 2005, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 160 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in Ryders domestic and international FMS and SCS business segments and Central Support Services (CSS). The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $3 million. Cost reductions associated with these actions will benefit salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Many of the eliminated positions in our domestic operations were impacted by Ryders decision to outsource certain administrative finance functions to lower cost foreign providers and maximize our technology resources. Transition actions will begin in February 2006 and continue through the remainder of 2006. We also closed two administrative offices in the U.S. as a result of the restructuring of our FMS domestic business operations and recorded a charge for future cash payments related to lease obligations. As part of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions, Ryder management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced telecommunication services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 2010. In accordance with the terms of the services agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling nearly $1 million for contract termination costs. The transition activities are expected to be completed in the first half of 2006 and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services will benefit operating expenses starting in the latter part of 2006. These charges were partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals due to refinements in estimates. 2004 Activity During 2004, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other recoveries of $18 million that consisted of gains from the sale of the previous headquarters complex and reversals of severance and employee related accruals partially offset by contract termination costs. During 2004, we recognized $24 million in gains from properties sold in connection with the relocation of our headquarters. In May 2004, we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters facility for $39 million in cash and recognized a $22 million gain from the sale. In conjunction with this sale, we entered into a lease agreement with the purchaser to lease back the headquarters facility until we relocated to our new headquarters in April 2005. Also during 2004, we recognized gains totaling $2 million from the sale of properties ancillary to our main headquarters facility. In 2004, as part of ongoing cost containment initiatives, Ryder management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced information technology infrastructure services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2010. In accordance with the terms of the services agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling $8 million for contract termination ($6 million) and transition costs incurred since termination ($2 million). By December 31, 2004, all transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses starting in 2005. 2003 Activity During 2003, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 140 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in Ryders FMS and SCS business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $6 million. While many of these employees had not been terminated by December 31, 2003, such actions were substantially finalized by March 31, 2004. Estimated annual pre tax cost savings in salaries and employee related costs realized from these actions approximate $11 million. These charges were offset by reversals of severance and employee related accruals totaling $1 million due to refinements in estimates, recovery of $4 million from the settlement of a commercial dispute pertaining to prior billings with an information technology vendor and gains of $1 million on sales of owned facilities identified for closure in prior restructuring charges. See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges (Recoveries), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Provision for income taxes $ 129,460 115,513 76,916 12 % 50 Effective tax rate 36.3% 34.9% 36.2% The 2005 effective tax rate includes a tax benefit of $8 million associated with the State of Ohio enacted tax legislation, which phases out the Ohio corporate franchise (income) tax and phases in a new gross receipts tax called the Commercial Activity Tax (CAT) over a five year period. While the corporate franchise (income) tax was generally based on federal taxable income, the CAT is based on current year sales and rentals in Ohio. As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the elimination of Ohios corporate franchise (income) tax over the next five years resulted in a favorable adjustment to deferred income taxes. The 2004 effective tax rate includes a net tax benefit of $9 million associated with the completion of the audit of our federal income tax returns for the 1995 to 1997 period, partially offset by provisions made for loss contingencies related to the 1998 through 2000 period. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS represents those costs incurred to support all of our business segments, including sales and marketing, human resources, finance, corporate services, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each of our business segments and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, corporate communications, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at approximate fair value as if the transactions were made with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) is included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer, and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2005 versus 2004 Total revenue grew in 2005 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue for 2005 increased as a result of higher commercial rental and contract related maintenance revenue and the impact of acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $21 million of total additional revenue in 2005. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2005 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.6%. Full service lease revenue increased in 2005 primarily from the acquisition completed in March 2004 and growth in Canada as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) acquisitions) in the first half of 2005. Our U.S. business showed improved revenue growth trends in the second half of 2005 as a result of positive net sales. In 2006, we expect growth in full service lease revenue due to recent sales activity and improving retention results. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we also restructured our FMS operations to better service customers and drive future growth in full service lease. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue, which generally represents ancillary services supporting core product lines, benefited from ongoing initiatives aimed at growing these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of stronger pricing and revenue contributions attributed to the acquisition completed in March 2004. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue to improve in 2006 based on improved pricing discipline. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates approximately 85% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 296,435 292,241 252,968 1% 16 Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 284,187 257,828 206,653 10% 25 Average commercial rental fleet size(2) 36,500 36,000 32,800 1% 10 Average commercial rental power fleet size (2),(3) 26,100 25,000 22,900 4% 9 Commercial rental utilization 74.6% 76.9% 72.1% (230) bps 480 bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT grew $42 million in 2005 as a result of improved commercial rental results from higher pricing, higher gains on disposal of used vehicles resulting from stronger volume and pricing, and lower overhead costs, including performance based incentive compensation. 2004 versus 2003 Total revenue grew in 2004 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices and higher volumes attributed to acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $177 million of revenue in 2004. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2004 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. Full service lease revenue increased in 2004 primarily from acquisitions that added approximately 7,000 vehicles to our lease fleet. Comparisons were also favorably impacted by higher revenue in Canada and the U.K. as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) as a result of weak leasing demand in 2003 and flat net sales in 2004. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue increased due to initiatives implemented to drive growth in these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of higher rental pricing and utilization in each of our markets and a 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) larger fleet size. Commercial rental revenue in 2004 also benefited from revenue contributions attributed to acquisitions. FMS NBT grew $118 million in 2004 as a result of the acquisitions that allowed us to leverage our existing infrastructure, improved commercial rental results from higher rental pricing and utilization, higher gains on disposal of used revenue earning equipment from stronger pricing and volume, and lower pension costs. The impact of these items was partially offset by lower full service lease and contract maintenance revenue in our base business (excluding acquired contracts). Our global fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment and contract maintenance vehicles is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ Number of Units 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 End of period count By type: Trucks 63,200 63,700 62,400 (1 )% 2 Tractors 52,700 51,700 48,900 2 6 Trailers 40,600 43,100 43,200 (6 ) Other 5,800 5,900 5,700 (2 ) 4 Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 By product line: Full service lease 118,400 119,700 118,900 (1 )% 1 Commercial rental 40,500 41,700 38,500 (3 ) 8 Service and other vehicles 3,400 3,000 2,800 13 7 Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 Owned(1) 156,500 157,000 150,200 % 5 Leased 5,800 7,400 10,000 (22 ) (26 ) Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 Full year average 164,900 164,300 160,000 % 3 Customer vehicles under contract maintenance (end of period) 26,400 28,500 29,000 (7 )% (2 ) (1) Effective March 1, 2004, approximately 6,400 units were added to the fleet as part of the Ruan acquisition. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. NLE units represent vehicles held for sale, as well as vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. These vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to the higher level of lease vehicle replacement and increased out servicing activity of rental vehicles. In 2006, we expect the number of NLE units to remain at the current levels.

Subcontracted transportation is deducted from total revenue to arrive at our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was primarily due to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation, is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2005, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect revenue improvements to continue over the near term. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of the year. 2004 versus 2003 SCS total revenue and operating revenue declined in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain U.S. and international customer contracts. Additionally, international operating revenue in 2003 included $21 million associated with an inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. The unfavorable operating revenue comparisons were partially offset by new contract start ups and expansions in the U.S., Canada and Latin America and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Both SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. In 2004, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 30% of SCS total revenue and 19% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT declined $3 million in 2004 primarily due to lower operating revenue partially offset by reduced overhead spending resulting from continued profit improvement actions. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is deducted from total revenue to arrive at our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 DCC total and operating revenue decreased in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain customer contracts, partially offset by the pass through of higher average fuel prices. DCC NBT declined $6 million in 2004 as a result of lower revenue, increased driver costs and higher safety and insurance expenses, partially offset by lower overhead spending. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarters facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarters relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. We expect reductions in CSS spending levels over the near term based on continuing cost containment and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 Total CSS costs decreased in 2004 as a result of ongoing cost containment and process improvement actions, most notably in information technology (IT). This decrease was partially offset by higher performance based incentive compensation costs attributed to the improved overall performance. Technology costs were lower in 2004 due primarily to reduced pricing on purchased IT services. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2004 largely due to Sarbanes Oxley compliance costs that were not allocated to the business segments and higher performance based incentive compensation. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Financing activities 241,505 (195,760 ) (232,796 ) Investing activities (988,855 ) (720,113 ) (543,165 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (3,956 ) 9,368 8,738 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 27,756 (39,656 ) 36,390 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to improved operating performance and the add back of depreciation expense attributed to VIEs that were consolidated effective July 1, 2003. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Cash used in financing activities decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher debt borrowings and proceeds from stock option exercises were partially offset by increased stock repurchases. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher capital expenditures, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. Cash used in investing activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due to higher capital expenditures and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions. Capital expenditures increased in 2004 due to planned higher levels of vehicle replacements for equipment under lease to our customers and new lease sales. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions completed during 2004. We manage our business to maximize operating cash flows and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities as free cash flow. Although free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure, we consider it to be an important measure of comparative operating performance. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Collections on direct finance leases 70,408 63,795 61,368 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,963 42,839 13,392 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,752 288,674 196,198 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 13,181 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) (734,509 ) Acquisitions (15,110 ) (148,791 ) (96,518 ) Other, net 21,511 6,995 3,723 Free cash flow $ (209,793 ) 146,736 260,448 We used $210 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $147 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) offset by lower acquisition spending. Free cash flow decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher capital spending and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions offset better operating performance, higher proceeds from sales of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions. Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow comparisons in the first half of 2004 were also positively impacted by the add back of depreciation expense of approximately $40 million attributed to VIEs that were consolidated as a result of the adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. We anticipate negative free cash flow levels to improve in 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower income tax payments. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,082,332 862,994 459,239 Commercial rental 251,278 241,858 219,880 1,333,610 1,104,852 679,119 Operating property and equipment 77,360 59,767 46,011 Total capital expenditures 1,410,970 1,164,619 725,130 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (11,591 ) (72,461 ) 9,379 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,399,379 1,092,158 734,509 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $0.4 million, $54 million and $67 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures grew in 2005 and 2004 due primarily to increased replacement activity in our full service lease business. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels should be relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. As a result of our fleet age and anticipated higher levels of new sales and replacement activity, total capital expenditures are anticipated to increase to approximately $1.6 billion in 2006, including lease vehicle replacements of approximately $1.1 billion and spending for anticipated incremental lease growth of approximately $200 million. We expect to fund 2006 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In both 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Ryder completed two acquisitions related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $15 million in 2005, $149 million in 2004 and $97 million in 2003. Approximately $4 million is due to the sellers at December 31, 2005 and will be paid subject to holdback 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) provisions set forth in the purchase agreements. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2006. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 1,783,216 1,815,900 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 188,271 79,033 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 600,000 135,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 162,124 147,153 Retirement of debentures (200,000 ) (72,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (343,933 ) (384,932 ) 406,462 (95,746 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (4,152 ) (9,380 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 433 54,094 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (593 ) 18,348 Total changes in debt 402,150 (32,684 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 32% at December 31, 2005, compared with 37% at December 31, 2004. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2005 Equity 2004 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,185,366 143% $ 1,783,216 118% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 117,062 161,138 Total obligations $ 2,302,428 151% $ 1,944,354 129% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total shareholders equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total shareholders equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess Ryders overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2005 was driven by our increased funding needs as a result of higher vehicle capital spending requirements, higher income tax payments and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A downgrade of Ryders debt rating below investment grade level would limit our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2005 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility is used primarily to finance working capital internationally and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. The credit facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no facility supported letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. During May 2005, the terms of the credit facility were amended thereby extending the expiration of the facility one year to 2010 and reducing the current annual facility fee from 15.0 basis points to 11.0 basis points. The annual facility fee applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2005 was 128%. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, we repaid $200 million of debentures. In September 2005, Ryder filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that were carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. The universal shelf registration statement became effective in November 2005. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) December 31, 2005, Ryder had $800 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder System, Inc., entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is similar to Ryders previous accounts receivable facility, which expired in December 2004, except that this program will be a 364 day facility. This program will be accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which would cause early termination, the program will expire on September 12, 2006, unless extended by the parties. At December 31, 2005, no receivables were sold pursuant to the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2005, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 474 Shelf registration statement 800 Trade receivables facility 200 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans and insurance companies) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be VIEs. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale and operating leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from such sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. These leases contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We did not enter into any sale and operating leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2003. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $16 million and $26 million, respectively, and we have accrued $3 million as a corresponding liability. See Note 17, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2005: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 268,716 438,880 865,837 610,113 2,183,546 Capital lease obligations 722 871 171 56 1,820 Total debt 269,438 439,751 866,008 610,169 2,185,366 Interest on debt(1) 113,332 174,251 120,934 223,016 631,533 Operating leases(2) 102,474 132,255 62,538 66,067 363,334 Purchase obligations(3) 28,794 33,543 8,975 71,312 Total contractual cash obligations 244,600 340,049 192,447 289,083 1,066,179 Insurance obligations(4) 111,163 99,107 40,156 52,814 303,240 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 13,115 1,001 17,104 31,220 Total $ 625,201 892,022 1,099,612 969,170 3,586,005 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2005. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to information technology services. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were derivative contracts, deferred compensation obligations and legal contractual obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2006, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $71 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2006 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $115 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In connection with the accrual of the additional minimum pension liability, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $221 million and $189 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which increased at December 31, 2005 as reductions in discount rates offset the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 7% in 2005. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may, from time to time, make voluntary contributions to our pension plans. During 2005, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $12 million compared with $70 million in 2004. After considering the 2005 contributions, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $115 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. Share Repurchases and Cash Dividends In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. At December 31, 2005, we had repurchased and retired approximately 2.6 million shares under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $109 million. Management has established a prearranged written plan under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allows for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We expect to complete the October 2005 program in the first quarter of 2006. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through employee stock purchase plans since May 1, 2004, which totaled approximately 2.4 million shares at December 31, 2005. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan under Rule 10b5 1 as part of the July 2004 program. In 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate, in part, the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003 up to $90 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the 2003 program. In 2004 and 2003, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million and 117,500 shares, respectively, under the 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million and $3 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $41 million in 2005, $39 million in 2004 and $38 million in 2003. During 2005, we increased our annual dividend to $0.64 per share of common stock. In February 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.16 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2005. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 16, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.5 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement totaled $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% and a fair value of $1.2 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2004 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $13 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements totaled $0.8 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $607 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $285 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2004 totaled $5 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2006 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $10 million and $16 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.1 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $9 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2005, we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004 and $1 million in 2003. We incurred environmental expenses of $9 million, $10 million and $12 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2005 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2005, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2006, which will cause depreciation expense in 2006 to decrease by approximately $13 million compared with 2005. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2006 by approximately $85 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2005, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $5 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2006 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 76% equity securities and 24% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an unrecognized loss of $428 million at the end of 2005 compared with a loss of $371 million at the end of 2004. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2005 results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and assets earning a rate of return below the assumed rates offset in part by the amortization of the opening balance. To the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. The amount of the unrecognized loss subject to amortization in 2006 will be $281 million. The effect on years beyond 2006 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2005 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2006 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2006 Net December 31, 2005 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.90% + 0.25% $5 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.90% 0.25% + $5 million + $41 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $2 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2005, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2006 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2005, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $156 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, in certain instances (typically when we manage transportation for our customers), we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis. In transportation management contracts where we act as an agent, we have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. In addition, we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments. During 2005, we entered into a significant SCS managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as principal in the arrangement. As a result, we recognized an additional $135 million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in 2005 by reporting revenue on a gross basis. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $235 million and $257 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. The amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at December 31, 2004 and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Share Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of SFAS No. 123R would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax benefits and headquarters complex sale. We believe that the comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2010. In accordance with the terms of the services agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling $8 million for contract termination ($6 million) and transition costs incurred since termination ($2 million). By December 31, 2004, all transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses starting in 2005. 2003 Activity During 2003, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 140 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in Ryders FMS and SCS business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $6 million. While many of these employees had not been terminated by December 31, 2003, such actions were substantially finalized by March 31, 2004. Estimated annual pre tax cost savings in salaries and employee related costs realized from these actions approximate $11 million. These charges were offset by reversals of severance and employee related accruals totaling $1 million due to refinements in estimates, recovery of $4 million from the settlement of a commercial dispute pertaining to prior billings with an information technology vendor and gains of $1 million on sales of owned facilities identified for closure in prior restructuring charges. See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges (Recoveries), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

While the corporate franchise (income) tax was generally based on federal taxable income, the CAT is based on current year sales and rentals in Ohio. As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the elimination of Ohios corporate franchise (income) tax over the next five years resulted in a favorable adjustment to deferred income taxes. The 2004 effective tax rate includes a net tax benefit of $9 million associated with the completion of the audit of our federal income tax returns for the 1995 to 1997 period, partially offset by provisions made for loss contingencies related to the 1998 through 2000 period. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS represents those costs incurred to support all of our business segments, including sales and marketing, human resources, finance, corporate services, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each of our business segments and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, corporate communications, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at approximate fair value as if the transactions were made with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) is included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer, and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2005 versus 2004 Total revenue grew in 2005 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue for 2005 increased as a result of higher commercial rental and contract related maintenance revenue and the impact of acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $21 million of total additional revenue in 2005. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2005 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.6%. Full service lease revenue increased in 2005 primarily from the acquisition completed in March 2004 and growth in Canada as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) acquisitions) in the first half of 2005. Our U.S. business showed improved revenue growth trends in the second half of 2005 as a result of positive net sales. In 2006, we expect growth in full service lease revenue due to recent sales activity and improving retention results. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we also restructured our FMS operations to better service customers and drive future growth in full service lease. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue, which generally represents ancillary services supporting core product lines, benefited from ongoing initiatives aimed at growing these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of stronger pricing and revenue contributions attributed to the acquisition completed in March 2004. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue to improve in 2006 based on improved pricing discipline. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates approximately 85% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 296,435 292,241 252,968 1% 16 Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 284,187 257,828 206,653 10% 25 Average commercial rental fleet size(2) 36,500 36,000 32,800 1% 10 Average commercial rental power fleet size (2),(3) 26,100 25,000 22,900 4% 9 Commercial rental utilization 74.6% 76.9% 72.1% (230) bps 480 bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT grew $42 million in 2005 as a result of improved commercial rental results from higher pricing, higher gains on disposal of used vehicles resulting from stronger volume and pricing, and lower overhead costs, including performance based incentive compensation. 2004 versus 2003 Total revenue grew in 2004 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices and higher volumes attributed to acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $177 million of revenue in 2004. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2004 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. Full service lease revenue increased in 2004 primarily from acquisitions that added approximately 7,000 vehicles to our lease fleet. Comparisons were also favorably impacted by higher revenue in Canada and the U.K. as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) as a result of weak leasing demand in 2003 and flat net sales in 2004. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue increased due to initiatives implemented to drive growth in these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of higher rental pricing and utilization in each of our markets and a 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) larger fleet size. Commercial rental revenue in 2004 also benefited from revenue contributions attributed to acquisitions. FMS NBT grew $118 million in 2004 as a result of the acquisitions that allowed us to leverage our existing infrastructure, improved commercial rental results from higher rental pricing and utilization, higher gains on disposal of used revenue earning equipment from stronger pricing and volume, and lower pension costs. The impact of these items was partially offset by lower full service lease and contract maintenance revenue in our base business (excluding acquired contracts). Our global fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment and contract maintenance vehicles is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ Number of Units 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 End of period count By type: Trucks 63,200 63,700 62,400 (1 )% 2 Tractors 52,700 51,700 48,900 2 6 Trailers 40,600 43,100 43,200 (6 ) Other 5,800 5,900 5,700 (2 ) 4 Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 By product line: Full service lease 118,400 119,700 118,900 (1 )% 1 Commercial rental 40,500 41,700 38,500 (3 ) 8 Service and other vehicles 3,400 3,000 2,800 13 7 Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 Owned(1) 156,500 157,000 150,200 % 5 Leased 5,800 7,400 10,000 (22 ) (26 ) Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 Full year average 164,900 164,300 160,000 % 3 Customer vehicles under contract maintenance (end of period) 26,400 28,500 29,000 (7 )% (2 ) (1) Effective March 1, 2004, approximately 6,400 units were added to the fleet as part of the Ruan acquisition. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. NLE units represent vehicles held for sale, as well as vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. These vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to the higher level of lease vehicle replacement and increased out servicing activity of rental vehicles. In 2006, we expect the number of NLE units to remain at the current levels.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was primarily due to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation, is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2005, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect revenue improvements to continue over the near term. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of the year. 2004 versus 2003 SCS total revenue and operating revenue declined in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain U.S. and international customer contracts. Additionally, international operating revenue in 2003 included $21 million associated with an inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. The unfavorable operating revenue comparisons were partially offset by new contract start ups and expansions in the U.S., Canada and Latin America and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Both SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. In 2004, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 30% of SCS total revenue and 19% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT declined $3 million in 2004 primarily due to lower operating revenue partially offset by reduced overhead spending resulting from continued profit improvement actions. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 DCC total and operating revenue decreased in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain customer contracts, partially offset by the pass through of higher average fuel prices. DCC NBT declined $6 million in 2004 as a result of lower revenue, increased driver costs and higher safety and insurance expenses, partially offset by lower overhead spending. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarters facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarters relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. We expect reductions in CSS spending levels over the near term based on continuing cost containment and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 Total CSS costs decreased in 2004 as a result of ongoing cost containment and process improvement actions, most notably in information technology (IT). This decrease was partially offset by higher performance based incentive compensation costs attributed to the improved overall performance. Technology costs were lower in 2004 due primarily to reduced pricing on purchased IT services. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2004 largely due to Sarbanes Oxley compliance costs that were not allocated to the business segments and higher performance based incentive compensation. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Financing activities 241,505 (195,760 ) (232,796 ) Investing activities (988,855 ) (720,113 ) (543,165 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (3,956 ) 9,368 8,738 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 27,756 (39,656 ) 36,390 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to improved operating performance and the add back of depreciation expense attributed to VIEs that were consolidated effective July 1, 2003. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Cash used in financing activities decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher debt borrowings and proceeds from stock option exercises were partially offset by increased stock repurchases. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher capital expenditures, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. Cash used in investing activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due to higher capital expenditures and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions. Capital expenditures increased in 2004 due to planned higher levels of vehicle replacements for equipment under lease to our customers and new lease sales. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions completed during 2004. We manage our business to maximize operating cash flows and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities as free cash flow. Although free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure, we consider it to be an important measure of comparative operating performance. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Collections on direct finance leases 70,408 63,795 61,368 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,963 42,839 13,392 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,752 288,674 196,198 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 13,181 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) (734,509 ) Acquisitions (15,110 ) (148,791 ) (96,518 ) Other, net 21,511 6,995 3,723 Free cash flow $ (209,793 ) 146,736 260,448 We used $210 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $147 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) offset by lower acquisition spending. Free cash flow decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher capital spending and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions offset better operating performance, higher proceeds from sales of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions. Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow comparisons in the first half of 2004 were also positively impacted by the add back of depreciation expense of approximately $40 million attributed to VIEs that were consolidated as a result of the adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. We anticipate negative free cash flow levels to improve in 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower income tax payments. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,082,332 862,994 459,239 Commercial rental 251,278 241,858 219,880 1,333,610 1,104,852 679,119 Operating property and equipment 77,360 59,767 46,011 Total capital expenditures 1,410,970 1,164,619 725,130 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (11,591 ) (72,461 ) 9,379 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,399,379 1,092,158 734,509 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $0.4 million, $54 million and $67 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures grew in 2005 and 2004 due primarily to increased replacement activity in our full service lease business. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels should be relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. As a result of our fleet age and anticipated higher levels of new sales and replacement activity, total capital expenditures are anticipated to increase to approximately $1.6 billion in 2006, including lease vehicle replacements of approximately $1.1 billion and spending for anticipated incremental lease growth of approximately $200 million. We expect to fund 2006 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In both 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Ryder completed two acquisitions related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $15 million in 2005, $149 million in 2004 and $97 million in 2003. Approximately $4 million is due to the sellers at December 31, 2005 and will be paid subject to holdback 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) provisions set forth in the purchase agreements. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2006. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 1,783,216 1,815,900 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 188,271 79,033 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 600,000 135,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 162,124 147,153 Retirement of debentures (200,000 ) (72,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (343,933 ) (384,932 ) 406,462 (95,746 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (4,152 ) (9,380 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 433 54,094 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (593 ) 18,348 Total changes in debt 402,150 (32,684 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 32% at December 31, 2005, compared with 37% at December 31, 2004. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2005 Equity 2004 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,185,366 143% $ 1,783,216 118% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 117,062 161,138 Total obligations $ 2,302,428 151% $ 1,944,354 129% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total shareholders equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total shareholders equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess Ryders overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2005 was driven by our increased funding needs as a result of higher vehicle capital spending requirements, higher income tax payments and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A downgrade of Ryders debt rating below investment grade level would limit our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2005 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility is used primarily to finance working capital internationally and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. The credit facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no facility supported letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. During May 2005, the terms of the credit facility were amended thereby extending the expiration of the facility one year to 2010 and reducing the current annual facility fee from 15.0 basis points to 11.0 basis points. The annual facility fee applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2005 was 128%. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, we repaid $200 million of debentures. In September 2005, Ryder filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that were carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. The universal shelf registration statement became effective in November 2005. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) December 31, 2005, Ryder had $800 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder System, Inc., entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is similar to Ryders previous accounts receivable facility, which expired in December 2004, except that this program will be a 364 day facility. This program will be accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which would cause early termination, the program will expire on September 12, 2006, unless extended by the parties. At December 31, 2005, no receivables were sold pursuant to the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2005, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 474 Shelf registration statement 800 Trade receivables facility 200 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans and insurance companies) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be VIEs. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale and operating leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from such sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. These leases contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We did not enter into any sale and operating leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2003. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $16 million and $26 million, respectively, and we have accrued $3 million as a corresponding liability. See Note 17, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2005: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 268,716 438,880 865,837 610,113 2,183,546 Capital lease obligations 722 871 171 56 1,820 Total debt 269,438 439,751 866,008 610,169 2,185,366 Interest on debt(1) 113,332 174,251 120,934 223,016 631,533 Operating leases(2) 102,474 132,255 62,538 66,067 363,334 Purchase obligations(3) 28,794 33,543 8,975 71,312 Total contractual cash obligations 244,600 340,049 192,447 289,083 1,066,179 Insurance obligations(4) 111,163 99,107 40,156 52,814 303,240 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 13,115 1,001 17,104 31,220 Total $ 625,201 892,022 1,099,612 969,170 3,586,005 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2005. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to information technology services. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were derivative contracts, deferred compensation obligations and legal contractual obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2006, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $71 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2006 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $115 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In connection with the accrual of the additional minimum pension liability, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $221 million and $189 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which increased at December 31, 2005 as reductions in discount rates offset the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 7% in 2005. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may, from time to time, make voluntary contributions to our pension plans. During 2005, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $12 million compared with $70 million in 2004. After considering the 2005 contributions, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $115 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. Share Repurchases and Cash Dividends In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. At December 31, 2005, we had repurchased and retired approximately 2.6 million shares under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $109 million. Management has established a prearranged written plan under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allows for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We expect to complete the October 2005 program in the first quarter of 2006. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through employee stock purchase plans since May 1, 2004, which totaled approximately 2.4 million shares at December 31, 2005. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan under Rule 10b5 1 as part of the July 2004 program. In 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate, in part, the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003 up to $90 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the 2003 program. In 2004 and 2003, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million and 117,500 shares, respectively, under the 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million and $3 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $41 million in 2005, $39 million in 2004 and $38 million in 2003. During 2005, we increased our annual dividend to $0.64 per share of common stock. In February 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.16 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2005. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 16, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.5 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement totaled $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% and a fair value of $1.2 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2004 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $13 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements totaled $0.8 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $607 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $285 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2004 totaled $5 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2006 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $10 million and $16 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.1 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $9 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2005, we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004 and $1 million in 2003. We incurred environmental expenses of $9 million, $10 million and $12 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2005 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2005, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2006, which will cause depreciation expense in 2006 to decrease by approximately $13 million compared with 2005. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2006 by approximately $85 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2005, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $5 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2006 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 76% equity securities and 24% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an unrecognized loss of $428 million at the end of 2005 compared with a loss of $371 million at the end of 2004. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2005 results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and assets earning a rate of return below the assumed rates offset in part by the amortization of the opening balance. To the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. The amount of the unrecognized loss subject to amortization in 2006 will be $281 million. The effect on years beyond 2006 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2005 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2006 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2006 Net December 31, 2005 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.90% + 0.25% $5 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.90% 0.25% + $5 million + $41 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $2 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2005, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2006 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2005, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $156 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, in certain instances (typically when we manage transportation for our customers), we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis. In transportation management contracts where we act as an agent, we have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. In addition, we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments. During 2005, we entered into a significant SCS managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as principal in the arrangement. As a result, we recognized an additional $135 million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in 2005 by reporting revenue on a gross basis. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $235 million and $257 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. The amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at December 31, 2004 and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Share Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of SFAS No. 123R would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax benefits and headquarters complex sale. We believe that the comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Forward looking statements (within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) are statements that relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends concerning matters that are not historical facts.

CSS represents those costs incurred to support all of our business segments, including sales and marketing, human resources, finance, corporate services, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each of our business segments and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, corporate communications, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at approximate fair value as if the transactions were made with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) is included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer, and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 15,860 14,971 15,319 Dedicated Contract Carriage 16,800 17,757 18,267 Total $ 32,660 32,728 33,586 Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Fleet Management Solutions Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Full service lease $ 1,785,606 1,766,675 1,668,998 1 % 6 Contract maintenance 134,492 136,327 142,602 (1 ) (4 ) Contract related maintenance 194,660 178,049 162,898 9 9 Commercial rental 686,343 649,847 540,691 6 20 Other 63,830 69,743 75,759 (8 ) (8 ) Operating revenue(1) 2,864,931 2,800,641 2,590,948 2 8 Fuel services revenue 1,056,260 802,198 640,727 32 25 Total revenue $ 3,921,191 3,602,839 3,231,675 9 % 11 Segment NBT $ 354,354 312,706 194,940 13 % 60 Segment NBT as a % of total revenue 9.0% 8.7% 6.0% 30 bps 270 bps Segment NBT as a % of operating revenue(1) 12.4% 11.2% 7.5% 120 bps 370 bps (1) We use operating revenue, a non GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of our FMS business segment and as a measure of sales activity. Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2005 versus 2004 Total revenue grew in 2005 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue for 2005 increased as a result of higher commercial rental and contract related maintenance revenue and the impact of acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $21 million of total additional revenue in 2005. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2005 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.6%. Full service lease revenue increased in 2005 primarily from the acquisition completed in March 2004 and growth in Canada as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) acquisitions) in the first half of 2005. Our U.S. business showed improved revenue growth trends in the second half of 2005 as a result of positive net sales. In 2006, we expect growth in full service lease revenue due to recent sales activity and improving retention results. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we also restructured our FMS operations to better service customers and drive future growth in full service lease. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue, which generally represents ancillary services supporting core product lines, benefited from ongoing initiatives aimed at growing these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of stronger pricing and revenue contributions attributed to the acquisition completed in March 2004. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue to improve in 2006 based on improved pricing discipline. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates approximately 85% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 296,435 292,241 252,968 1% 16 Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 284,187 257,828 206,653 10% 25 Average commercial rental fleet size(2) 36,500 36,000 32,800 1% 10 Average commercial rental power fleet size (2),(3) 26,100 25,000 22,900 4% 9 Commercial rental utilization 74.6% 76.9% 72.1% (230) bps 480 bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT grew $42 million in 2005 as a result of improved commercial rental results from higher pricing, higher gains on disposal of used vehicles resulting from stronger volume and pricing, and lower overhead costs, including performance based incentive compensation. 2004 versus 2003 Total revenue grew in 2004 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices and higher volumes attributed to acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $177 million of revenue in 2004. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2004 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. Full service lease revenue increased in 2004 primarily from acquisitions that added approximately 7,000 vehicles to our lease fleet. Comparisons were also favorably impacted by higher revenue in Canada and the U.K. as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) as a result of weak leasing demand in 2003 and flat net sales in 2004. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue increased due to initiatives implemented to drive growth in these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of higher rental pricing and utilization in each of our markets and a 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) larger fleet size. Commercial rental revenue in 2004 also benefited from revenue contributions attributed to acquisitions. FMS NBT grew $118 million in 2004 as a result of the acquisitions that allowed us to leverage our existing infrastructure, improved commercial rental results from higher rental pricing and utilization, higher gains on disposal of used revenue earning equipment from stronger pricing and volume, and lower pension costs. The impact of these items was partially offset by lower full service lease and contract maintenance revenue in our base business (excluding acquired contracts). Our global fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment and contract maintenance vehicles is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ Number of Units 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 End of period count By type: Trucks 63,200 63,700 62,400 (1 )% 2 Tractors 52,700 51,700 48,900 2 6 Trailers 40,600 43,100 43,200 (6 ) Other 5,800 5,900 5,700 (2 ) 4 Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 By product line: Full service lease 118,400 119,700 118,900 (1 )% 1 Commercial rental 40,500 41,700 38,500 (3 ) 8 Service and other vehicles 3,400 3,000 2,800 13 7 Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 Owned(1) 156,500 157,000 150,200 % 5 Leased 5,800 7,400 10,000 (22 ) (26 ) Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 Full year average 164,900 164,300 160,000 % 3 Customer vehicles under contract maintenance (end of period) 26,400 28,500 29,000 (7 )% (2 ) (1) Effective March 1, 2004, approximately 6,400 units were added to the fleet as part of the Ruan acquisition. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The totals in the table above include the following non revenue earning equipment for the U.S. fleet (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): December 31 Number of Units 2005 2004 Change Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 1,700 1,900 (11 )% No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale 4,700 4,800 (2 ) Other NLE units 2,200 1,600 38 Total(1) 8,600 8,300 4 % (1) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,500 vehicles in 2005 and 2004, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. NLE units represent vehicles held for sale, as well as vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. These vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to the higher level of lease vehicle replacement and increased out servicing activity of rental vehicles. In 2006, we expect the number of NLE units to remain at the current levels. Supply Chain Solutions Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) U.S. operating revenue: Automotive and industrial $ 449,376 425,103 419,655 6 % 1 High tech and consumer industries 252,032 230,030 247,475 10 (7 ) Transportation management 24,994 20,331 15,076 23 35 U.S. operating revenue 726,402 675,464 682,206 8 (1 ) International operating revenue 289,432 263,227 270,316 10 (3 ) Total operating revenue(1) 1,015,834 938,691 952,522 8 (1 ) Subcontracted transportation 621,992 415,312 409,906 50 1 Total revenue $ 1,637,826 1,354,003 1,362,428 21 % (1 ) Segment NBT $ 39,392 37,079 40,064 6 % (7 ) Segment NBT as a % of total revenue 2.4% 2.7% 2.9% (30 ) bps (20 ) bps Segment NBT as a % of operating revenue(1) 3.9% 4.0% 4.2% (10 ) bps (20 ) bps Memo: Fuel costs $ 91,976 65,685 57,804 40 % 14 (1) We use operating revenue, a non GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of our SCS business segment and as a measure of sales activity. Subcontracted transportation is deducted from total revenue to arrive at our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was primarily due to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation, is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2005, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect revenue improvements to continue over the near term. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of the year. 2004 versus 2003 SCS total revenue and operating revenue declined in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain U.S. and international customer contracts. Additionally, international operating revenue in 2003 included $21 million associated with an inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. The unfavorable operating revenue comparisons were partially offset by new contract start ups and expansions in the U.S., Canada and Latin America and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Both SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. In 2004, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 30% of SCS total revenue and 19% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT declined $3 million in 2004 primarily due to lower operating revenue partially offset by reduced overhead spending resulting from continued profit improvement actions. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is deducted from total revenue to arrive at our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 DCC total and operating revenue decreased in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain customer contracts, partially offset by the pass through of higher average fuel prices. DCC NBT declined $6 million in 2004 as a result of lower revenue, increased driver costs and higher safety and insurance expenses, partially offset by lower overhead spending. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Central Support Services CSS expenses were as follows: Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Sales and marketing $ 9,143 7,636 9,158 Human resources 14,647 13,982 18,000 Finance 56,964 56,136 55,180 Corporate services and public affairs 13,028 9,196 7,314 Information technology 63,569 69,457 78,084 Health and safety 8,717 7,952 7,682 Other 41,234 48,050 37,598 Total CSS 207,302 212,409 213,016 (2 )% Allocation of CSS to business segments (171,551 ) (179,348 ) (188,584 ) 4 5 Unallocated CSS $ 35,751 33,061 24,432 8 % 35 2005 versus 2004 Total CSS costs declined in 2005 primarily due to cost benefits associated with the insourcing and renegotiation of several information technology infrastructure services and lower performance based incentive compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarters facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarters relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. We expect reductions in CSS spending levels over the near term based on continuing cost containment and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 Total CSS costs decreased in 2004 as a result of ongoing cost containment and process improvement actions, most notably in information technology (IT). This decrease was partially offset by higher performance based incentive compensation costs attributed to the improved overall performance. Technology costs were lower in 2004 due primarily to reduced pricing on purchased IT services. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2004 largely due to Sarbanes Oxley compliance costs that were not allocated to the business segments and higher performance based incentive compensation. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Financing activities 241,505 (195,760 ) (232,796 ) Investing activities (988,855 ) (720,113 ) (543,165 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (3,956 ) 9,368 8,738 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 27,756 (39,656 ) 36,390 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to improved operating performance and the add back of depreciation expense attributed to VIEs that were consolidated effective July 1, 2003. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Cash used in financing activities decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher debt borrowings and proceeds from stock option exercises were partially offset by increased stock repurchases. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher capital expenditures, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. Cash used in investing activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due to higher capital expenditures and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions. Capital expenditures increased in 2004 due to planned higher levels of vehicle replacements for equipment under lease to our customers and new lease sales. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions completed during 2004. We manage our business to maximize operating cash flows and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities as free cash flow. Although free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure, we consider it to be an important measure of comparative operating performance. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Collections on direct finance leases 70,408 63,795 61,368 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,963 42,839 13,392 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,752 288,674 196,198 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 13,181 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) (734,509 ) Acquisitions (15,110 ) (148,791 ) (96,518 ) Other, net 21,511 6,995 3,723 Free cash flow $ (209,793 ) 146,736 260,448 We used $210 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $147 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) offset by lower acquisition spending. Free cash flow decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher capital spending and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions offset better operating performance, higher proceeds from sales of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions. Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow comparisons in the first half of 2004 were also positively impacted by the add back of depreciation expense of approximately $40 million attributed to VIEs that were consolidated as a result of the adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. We anticipate negative free cash flow levels to improve in 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower income tax payments. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,082,332 862,994 459,239 Commercial rental 251,278 241,858 219,880 1,333,610 1,104,852 679,119 Operating property and equipment 77,360 59,767 46,011 Total capital expenditures 1,410,970 1,164,619 725,130 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (11,591 ) (72,461 ) 9,379 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,399,379 1,092,158 734,509 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $0.4 million, $54 million and $67 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures grew in 2005 and 2004 due primarily to increased replacement activity in our full service lease business. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels should be relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. As a result of our fleet age and anticipated higher levels of new sales and replacement activity, total capital expenditures are anticipated to increase to approximately $1.6 billion in 2006, including lease vehicle replacements of approximately $1.1 billion and spending for anticipated incremental lease growth of approximately $200 million. We expect to fund 2006 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In both 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Ryder completed two acquisitions related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $15 million in 2005, $149 million in 2004 and $97 million in 2003. Approximately $4 million is due to the sellers at December 31, 2005 and will be paid subject to holdback 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) provisions set forth in the purchase agreements. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2006. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 1,783,216 1,815,900 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 188,271 79,033 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 600,000 135,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 162,124 147,153 Retirement of debentures (200,000 ) (72,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (343,933 ) (384,932 ) 406,462 (95,746 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (4,152 ) (9,380 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 433 54,094 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (593 ) 18,348 Total changes in debt 402,150 (32,684 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 32% at December 31, 2005, compared with 37% at December 31, 2004. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2005 Equity 2004 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,185,366 143% $ 1,783,216 118% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 117,062 161,138 Total obligations $ 2,302,428 151% $ 1,944,354 129% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total shareholders equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total shareholders equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess Ryders overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2005 was driven by our increased funding needs as a result of higher vehicle capital spending requirements, higher income tax payments and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A downgrade of Ryders debt rating below investment grade level would limit our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2005 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility is used primarily to finance working capital internationally and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. The credit facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no facility supported letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. During May 2005, the terms of the credit facility were amended thereby extending the expiration of the facility one year to 2010 and reducing the current annual facility fee from 15.0 basis points to 11.0 basis points. The annual facility fee applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2005 was 128%. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, we repaid $200 million of debentures. In September 2005, Ryder filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that were carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. The universal shelf registration statement became effective in November 2005. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) December 31, 2005, Ryder had $800 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder System, Inc., entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is similar to Ryders previous accounts receivable facility, which expired in December 2004, except that this program will be a 364 day facility. This program will be accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which would cause early termination, the program will expire on September 12, 2006, unless extended by the parties. At December 31, 2005, no receivables were sold pursuant to the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2005, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 474 Shelf registration statement 800 Trade receivables facility 200 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans and insurance companies) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be VIEs. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale and operating leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from such sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. These leases contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We did not enter into any sale and operating leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2003. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $16 million and $26 million, respectively, and we have accrued $3 million as a corresponding liability. See Note 17, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2005: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 268,716 438,880 865,837 610,113 2,183,546 Capital lease obligations 722 871 171 56 1,820 Total debt 269,438 439,751 866,008 610,169 2,185,366 Interest on debt(1) 113,332 174,251 120,934 223,016 631,533 Operating leases(2) 102,474 132,255 62,538 66,067 363,334 Purchase obligations(3) 28,794 33,543 8,975 71,312 Total contractual cash obligations 244,600 340,049 192,447 289,083 1,066,179 Insurance obligations(4) 111,163 99,107 40,156 52,814 303,240 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 13,115 1,001 17,104 31,220 Total $ 625,201 892,022 1,099,612 969,170 3,586,005 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2005. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to information technology services. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were derivative contracts, deferred compensation obligations and legal contractual obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2006, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $71 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2006 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $115 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In connection with the accrual of the additional minimum pension liability, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $221 million and $189 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which increased at December 31, 2005 as reductions in discount rates offset the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 7% in 2005. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may, from time to time, make voluntary contributions to our pension plans. During 2005, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $12 million compared with $70 million in 2004. After considering the 2005 contributions, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $115 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. Share Repurchases and Cash Dividends In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. At December 31, 2005, we had repurchased and retired approximately 2.6 million shares under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $109 million. Management has established a prearranged written plan under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allows for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We expect to complete the October 2005 program in the first quarter of 2006. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through employee stock purchase plans since May 1, 2004, which totaled approximately 2.4 million shares at December 31, 2005. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan under Rule 10b5 1 as part of the July 2004 program. In 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate, in part, the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003 up to $90 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the 2003 program. In 2004 and 2003, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million and 117,500 shares, respectively, under the 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million and $3 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $41 million in 2005, $39 million in 2004 and $38 million in 2003. During 2005, we increased our annual dividend to $0.64 per share of common stock. In February 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.16 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2005. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 16, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.5 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement totaled $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% and a fair value of $1.2 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2004 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $13 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements totaled $0.8 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $607 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $285 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2004 totaled $5 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2006 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $10 million and $16 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.1 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $9 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2005, we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004 and $1 million in 2003. We incurred environmental expenses of $9 million, $10 million and $12 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2005 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2005, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2006, which will cause depreciation expense in 2006 to decrease by approximately $13 million compared with 2005. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2006 by approximately $85 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2005, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $5 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2006 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 76% equity securities and 24% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an unrecognized loss of $428 million at the end of 2005 compared with a loss of $371 million at the end of 2004. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2005 results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and assets earning a rate of return below the assumed rates offset in part by the amortization of the opening balance. To the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. The amount of the unrecognized loss subject to amortization in 2006 will be $281 million. The effect on years beyond 2006 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2005 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2006 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2006 Net December 31, 2005 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.90% + 0.25% $5 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.90% 0.25% + $5 million + $41 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $2 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2005, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2006 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2005, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $156 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, in certain instances (typically when we manage transportation for our customers), we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis. In transportation management contracts where we act as an agent, we have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. In addition, we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments. During 2005, we entered into a significant SCS managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as principal in the arrangement. As a result, we recognized an additional $135 million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in 2005 by reporting revenue on a gross basis. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $235 million and $257 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. The amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at December 31, 2004 and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Share Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of SFAS No. 123R would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax benefits and headquarters complex sale. We believe that the comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 15,860 14,971 15,319 Dedicated Contract Carriage 16,800 17,757 18,267 Total $ 32,660 32,728 33,586 Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2005 versus 2004 Total revenue grew in 2005 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue for 2005 increased as a result of higher commercial rental and contract related maintenance revenue and the impact of acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $21 million of total additional revenue in 2005. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2005 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.6%. Full service lease revenue increased in 2005 primarily from the acquisition completed in March 2004 and growth in Canada as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) acquisitions) in the first half of 2005. Our U.S. business showed improved revenue growth trends in the second half of 2005 as a result of positive net sales. In 2006, we expect growth in full service lease revenue due to recent sales activity and improving retention results. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we also restructured our FMS operations to better service customers and drive future growth in full service lease. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue, which generally represents ancillary services supporting core product lines, benefited from ongoing initiatives aimed at growing these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of stronger pricing and revenue contributions attributed to the acquisition completed in March 2004. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue to improve in 2006 based on improved pricing discipline. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates approximately 85% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 296,435 292,241 252,968 1% 16 Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 284,187 257,828 206,653 10% 25 Average commercial rental fleet size(2) 36,500 36,000 32,800 1% 10 Average commercial rental power fleet size (2),(3) 26,100 25,000 22,900 4% 9 Commercial rental utilization 74.6% 76.9% 72.1% (230) bps 480 bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT grew $42 million in 2005 as a result of improved commercial rental results from higher pricing, higher gains on disposal of used vehicles resulting from stronger volume and pricing, and lower overhead costs, including performance based incentive compensation. 2004 versus 2003 Total revenue grew in 2004 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices and higher volumes attributed to acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $177 million of revenue in 2004. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2004 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. Full service lease revenue increased in 2004 primarily from acquisitions that added approximately 7,000 vehicles to our lease fleet. Comparisons were also favorably impacted by higher revenue in Canada and the U.K. as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) as a result of weak leasing demand in 2003 and flat net sales in 2004. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue increased due to initiatives implemented to drive growth in these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of higher rental pricing and utilization in each of our markets and a 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) larger fleet size. Commercial rental revenue in 2004 also benefited from revenue contributions attributed to acquisitions. FMS NBT grew $118 million in 2004 as a result of the acquisitions that allowed us to leverage our existing infrastructure, improved commercial rental results from higher rental pricing and utilization, higher gains on disposal of used revenue earning equipment from stronger pricing and volume, and lower pension costs. The impact of these items was partially offset by lower full service lease and contract maintenance revenue in our base business (excluding acquired contracts). Our global fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment and contract maintenance vehicles is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ Number of Units 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 End of period count By type: Trucks 63,200 63,700 62,400 (1 )% 2 Tractors 52,700 51,700 48,900 2 6 Trailers 40,600 43,100 43,200 (6 ) Other 5,800 5,900 5,700 (2 ) 4 Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 By product line: Full service lease 118,400 119,700 118,900 (1 )% 1 Commercial rental 40,500 41,700 38,500 (3 ) 8 Service and other vehicles 3,400 3,000 2,800 13 7 Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 Owned(1) 156,500 157,000 150,200 % 5 Leased 5,800 7,400 10,000 (22 ) (26 ) Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 Full year average 164,900 164,300 160,000 % 3 Customer vehicles under contract maintenance (end of period) 26,400 28,500 29,000 (7 )% (2 ) (1) Effective March 1, 2004, approximately 6,400 units were added to the fleet as part of the Ruan acquisition. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. NLE units represent vehicles held for sale, as well as vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. These vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to the higher level of lease vehicle replacement and increased out servicing activity of rental vehicles. In 2006, we expect the number of NLE units to remain at the current levels.

Subcontracted transportation is deducted from total revenue to arrive at our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was primarily due to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation, is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2005, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect revenue improvements to continue over the near term. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of the year. 2004 versus 2003 SCS total revenue and operating revenue declined in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain U.S. and international customer contracts. Additionally, international operating revenue in 2003 included $21 million associated with an inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. The unfavorable operating revenue comparisons were partially offset by new contract start ups and expansions in the U.S., Canada and Latin America and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Both SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. In 2004, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 30% of SCS total revenue and 19% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT declined $3 million in 2004 primarily due to lower operating revenue partially offset by reduced overhead spending resulting from continued profit improvement actions. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is deducted from total revenue to arrive at our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 DCC total and operating revenue decreased in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain customer contracts, partially offset by the pass through of higher average fuel prices. DCC NBT declined $6 million in 2004 as a result of lower revenue, increased driver costs and higher safety and insurance expenses, partially offset by lower overhead spending. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarters facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarters relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. We expect reductions in CSS spending levels over the near term based on continuing cost containment and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 Total CSS costs decreased in 2004 as a result of ongoing cost containment and process improvement actions, most notably in information technology (IT). This decrease was partially offset by higher performance based incentive compensation costs attributed to the improved overall performance. Technology costs were lower in 2004 due primarily to reduced pricing on purchased IT services. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2004 largely due to Sarbanes Oxley compliance costs that were not allocated to the business segments and higher performance based incentive compensation. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Financing activities 241,505 (195,760 ) (232,796 ) Investing activities (988,855 ) (720,113 ) (543,165 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (3,956 ) 9,368 8,738 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 27,756 (39,656 ) 36,390 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to improved operating performance and the add back of depreciation expense attributed to VIEs that were consolidated effective July 1, 2003. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Cash used in financing activities decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher debt borrowings and proceeds from stock option exercises were partially offset by increased stock repurchases. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher capital expenditures, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. Cash used in investing activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due to higher capital expenditures and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions. Capital expenditures increased in 2004 due to planned higher levels of vehicle replacements for equipment under lease to our customers and new lease sales. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions completed during 2004. We manage our business to maximize operating cash flows and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities as free cash flow. Although free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure, we consider it to be an important measure of comparative operating performance. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Collections on direct finance leases 70,408 63,795 61,368 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,963 42,839 13,392 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,752 288,674 196,198 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 13,181 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) (734,509 ) Acquisitions (15,110 ) (148,791 ) (96,518 ) Other, net 21,511 6,995 3,723 Free cash flow $ (209,793 ) 146,736 260,448 We used $210 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $147 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) offset by lower acquisition spending. Free cash flow decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher capital spending and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions offset better operating performance, higher proceeds from sales of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions. Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow comparisons in the first half of 2004 were also positively impacted by the add back of depreciation expense of approximately $40 million attributed to VIEs that were consolidated as a result of the adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. We anticipate negative free cash flow levels to improve in 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower income tax payments. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,082,332 862,994 459,239 Commercial rental 251,278 241,858 219,880 1,333,610 1,104,852 679,119 Operating property and equipment 77,360 59,767 46,011 Total capital expenditures 1,410,970 1,164,619 725,130 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (11,591 ) (72,461 ) 9,379 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,399,379 1,092,158 734,509 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $0.4 million, $54 million and $67 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures grew in 2005 and 2004 due primarily to increased replacement activity in our full service lease business. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels should be relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. As a result of our fleet age and anticipated higher levels of new sales and replacement activity, total capital expenditures are anticipated to increase to approximately $1.6 billion in 2006, including lease vehicle replacements of approximately $1.1 billion and spending for anticipated incremental lease growth of approximately $200 million. We expect to fund 2006 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In both 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Ryder completed two acquisitions related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $15 million in 2005, $149 million in 2004 and $97 million in 2003. Approximately $4 million is due to the sellers at December 31, 2005 and will be paid subject to holdback 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) provisions set forth in the purchase agreements. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2006. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 1,783,216 1,815,900 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 188,271 79,033 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 600,000 135,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 162,124 147,153 Retirement of debentures (200,000 ) (72,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (343,933 ) (384,932 ) 406,462 (95,746 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (4,152 ) (9,380 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 433 54,094 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (593 ) 18,348 Total changes in debt 402,150 (32,684 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 32% at December 31, 2005, compared with 37% at December 31, 2004. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2005 Equity 2004 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,185,366 143% $ 1,783,216 118% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 117,062 161,138 Total obligations $ 2,302,428 151% $ 1,944,354 129% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total shareholders equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total shareholders equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess Ryders overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2005 was driven by our increased funding needs as a result of higher vehicle capital spending requirements, higher income tax payments and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A downgrade of Ryders debt rating below investment grade level would limit our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2005 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility is used primarily to finance working capital internationally and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. The credit facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no facility supported letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. During May 2005, the terms of the credit facility were amended thereby extending the expiration of the facility one year to 2010 and reducing the current annual facility fee from 15.0 basis points to 11.0 basis points. The annual facility fee applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2005 was 128%. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, we repaid $200 million of debentures. In September 2005, Ryder filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that were carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. The universal shelf registration statement became effective in November 2005. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) December 31, 2005, Ryder had $800 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder System, Inc., entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is similar to Ryders previous accounts receivable facility, which expired in December 2004, except that this program will be a 364 day facility. This program will be accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which would cause early termination, the program will expire on September 12, 2006, unless extended by the parties. At December 31, 2005, no receivables were sold pursuant to the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2005, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 474 Shelf registration statement 800 Trade receivables facility 200 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans and insurance companies) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be VIEs. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale and operating leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from such sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. These leases contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We did not enter into any sale and operating leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2003. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $16 million and $26 million, respectively, and we have accrued $3 million as a corresponding liability. See Note 17, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2005: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 268,716 438,880 865,837 610,113 2,183,546 Capital lease obligations 722 871 171 56 1,820 Total debt 269,438 439,751 866,008 610,169 2,185,366 Interest on debt(1) 113,332 174,251 120,934 223,016 631,533 Operating leases(2) 102,474 132,255 62,538 66,067 363,334 Purchase obligations(3) 28,794 33,543 8,975 71,312 Total contractual cash obligations 244,600 340,049 192,447 289,083 1,066,179 Insurance obligations(4) 111,163 99,107 40,156 52,814 303,240 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 13,115 1,001 17,104 31,220 Total $ 625,201 892,022 1,099,612 969,170 3,586,005 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2005. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to information technology services. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were derivative contracts, deferred compensation obligations and legal contractual obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2006, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $71 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2006 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $115 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In connection with the accrual of the additional minimum pension liability, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $221 million and $189 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which increased at December 31, 2005 as reductions in discount rates offset the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 7% in 2005. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may, from time to time, make voluntary contributions to our pension plans. During 2005, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $12 million compared with $70 million in 2004. After considering the 2005 contributions, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $115 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. Share Repurchases and Cash Dividends In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. At December 31, 2005, we had repurchased and retired approximately 2.6 million shares under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $109 million. Management has established a prearranged written plan under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allows for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We expect to complete the October 2005 program in the first quarter of 2006. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through employee stock purchase plans since May 1, 2004, which totaled approximately 2.4 million shares at December 31, 2005. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan under Rule 10b5 1 as part of the July 2004 program. In 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate, in part, the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003 up to $90 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the 2003 program. In 2004 and 2003, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million and 117,500 shares, respectively, under the 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million and $3 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $41 million in 2005, $39 million in 2004 and $38 million in 2003. During 2005, we increased our annual dividend to $0.64 per share of common stock. In February 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.16 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2005. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 16, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.5 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement totaled $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% and a fair value of $1.2 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2004 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $13 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements totaled $0.8 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $607 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $285 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2004 totaled $5 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2006 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $10 million and $16 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.1 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $9 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2005, we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004 and $1 million in 2003. We incurred environmental expenses of $9 million, $10 million and $12 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2005 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2005, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2006, which will cause depreciation expense in 2006 to decrease by approximately $13 million compared with 2005. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2006 by approximately $85 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2005, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $5 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2006 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 76% equity securities and 24% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an unrecognized loss of $428 million at the end of 2005 compared with a loss of $371 million at the end of 2004. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2005 results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and assets earning a rate of return below the assumed rates offset in part by the amortization of the opening balance. To the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. The amount of the unrecognized loss subject to amortization in 2006 will be $281 million. The effect on years beyond 2006 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2005 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2006 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2006 Net December 31, 2005 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.90% + 0.25% $5 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.90% 0.25% + $5 million + $41 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $2 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2005, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2006 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2005, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $156 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, in certain instances (typically when we manage transportation for our customers), we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis. In transportation management contracts where we act as an agent, we have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. In addition, we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments. During 2005, we entered into a significant SCS managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as principal in the arrangement. As a result, we recognized an additional $135 million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in 2005 by reporting revenue on a gross basis. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $235 million and $257 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. The amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at December 31, 2004 and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Share Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of SFAS No. 123R would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax benefits and headquarters complex sale. We believe that the comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) acquisitions) in the first half of 2005. Our U.S. business showed improved revenue growth trends in the second half of 2005 as a result of positive net sales. In 2006, we expect growth in full service lease revenue due to recent sales activity and improving retention results. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we also restructured our FMS operations to better service customers and drive future growth in full service lease. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue, which generally represents ancillary services supporting core product lines, benefited from ongoing initiatives aimed at growing these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of stronger pricing and revenue contributions attributed to the acquisition completed in March 2004. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue to improve in 2006 based on improved pricing discipline. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates approximately 85% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 296,435 292,241 252,968 1% 16 Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 284,187 257,828 206,653 10% 25 Average commercial rental fleet size(2) 36,500 36,000 32,800 1% 10 Average commercial rental power fleet size (2),(3) 26,100 25,000 22,900 4% 9 Commercial rental utilization 74.6% 76.9% 72.1% (230) bps 480 bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT grew $42 million in 2005 as a result of improved commercial rental results from higher pricing, higher gains on disposal of used vehicles resulting from stronger volume and pricing, and lower overhead costs, including performance based incentive compensation. 2004 versus 2003 Total revenue grew in 2004 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices and higher volumes attributed to acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $177 million of revenue in 2004. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2004 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. Full service lease revenue increased in 2004 primarily from acquisitions that added approximately 7,000 vehicles to our lease fleet. Comparisons were also favorably impacted by higher revenue in Canada and the U.K. as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) as a result of weak leasing demand in 2003 and flat net sales in 2004. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue increased due to initiatives implemented to drive growth in these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of higher rental pricing and utilization in each of our markets and a 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) larger fleet size. Commercial rental revenue in 2004 also benefited from revenue contributions attributed to acquisitions. FMS NBT grew $118 million in 2004 as a result of the acquisitions that allowed us to leverage our existing infrastructure, improved commercial rental results from higher rental pricing and utilization, higher gains on disposal of used revenue earning equipment from stronger pricing and volume, and lower pension costs. The impact of these items was partially offset by lower full service lease and contract maintenance revenue in our base business (excluding acquired contracts).

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. NLE units represent vehicles held for sale, as well as vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. These vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to the higher level of lease vehicle replacement and increased out servicing activity of rental vehicles. In 2006, we expect the number of NLE units to remain at the current levels.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was primarily due to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation, is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2005, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect revenue improvements to continue over the near term. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of the year. 2004 versus 2003 SCS total revenue and operating revenue declined in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain U.S. and international customer contracts. Additionally, international operating revenue in 2003 included $21 million associated with an inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. The unfavorable operating revenue comparisons were partially offset by new contract start ups and expansions in the U.S., Canada and Latin America and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Both SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. In 2004, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 30% of SCS total revenue and 19% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT declined $3 million in 2004 primarily due to lower operating revenue partially offset by reduced overhead spending resulting from continued profit improvement actions. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 DCC total and operating revenue decreased in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain customer contracts, partially offset by the pass through of higher average fuel prices. DCC NBT declined $6 million in 2004 as a result of lower revenue, increased driver costs and higher safety and insurance expenses, partially offset by lower overhead spending. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarters facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarters relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. We expect reductions in CSS spending levels over the near term based on continuing cost containment and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 Total CSS costs decreased in 2004 as a result of ongoing cost containment and process improvement actions, most notably in information technology (IT). This decrease was partially offset by higher performance based incentive compensation costs attributed to the improved overall performance. Technology costs were lower in 2004 due primarily to reduced pricing on purchased IT services. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2004 largely due to Sarbanes Oxley compliance costs that were not allocated to the business segments and higher performance based incentive compensation. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Financing activities 241,505 (195,760 ) (232,796 ) Investing activities (988,855 ) (720,113 ) (543,165 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (3,956 ) 9,368 8,738 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 27,756 (39,656 ) 36,390 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to improved operating performance and the add back of depreciation expense attributed to VIEs that were consolidated effective July 1, 2003. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Cash used in financing activities decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher debt borrowings and proceeds from stock option exercises were partially offset by increased stock repurchases. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher capital expenditures, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. Cash used in investing activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due to higher capital expenditures and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions. Capital expenditures increased in 2004 due to planned higher levels of vehicle replacements for equipment under lease to our customers and new lease sales. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions completed during 2004. We manage our business to maximize operating cash flows and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities as free cash flow. Although free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure, we consider it to be an important measure of comparative operating performance. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Collections on direct finance leases 70,408 63,795 61,368 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,963 42,839 13,392 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,752 288,674 196,198 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 13,181 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) (734,509 ) Acquisitions (15,110 ) (148,791 ) (96,518 ) Other, net 21,511 6,995 3,723 Free cash flow $ (209,793 ) 146,736 260,448 We used $210 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $147 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) offset by lower acquisition spending. Free cash flow decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher capital spending and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions offset better operating performance, higher proceeds from sales of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions. Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow comparisons in the first half of 2004 were also positively impacted by the add back of depreciation expense of approximately $40 million attributed to VIEs that were consolidated as a result of the adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. We anticipate negative free cash flow levels to improve in 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower income tax payments. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,082,332 862,994 459,239 Commercial rental 251,278 241,858 219,880 1,333,610 1,104,852 679,119 Operating property and equipment 77,360 59,767 46,011 Total capital expenditures 1,410,970 1,164,619 725,130 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (11,591 ) (72,461 ) 9,379 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,399,379 1,092,158 734,509 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $0.4 million, $54 million and $67 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures grew in 2005 and 2004 due primarily to increased replacement activity in our full service lease business. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels should be relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. As a result of our fleet age and anticipated higher levels of new sales and replacement activity, total capital expenditures are anticipated to increase to approximately $1.6 billion in 2006, including lease vehicle replacements of approximately $1.1 billion and spending for anticipated incremental lease growth of approximately $200 million. We expect to fund 2006 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In both 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Ryder completed two acquisitions related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $15 million in 2005, $149 million in 2004 and $97 million in 2003. Approximately $4 million is due to the sellers at December 31, 2005 and will be paid subject to holdback 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) provisions set forth in the purchase agreements. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2006. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 1,783,216 1,815,900 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 188,271 79,033 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 600,000 135,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 162,124 147,153 Retirement of debentures (200,000 ) (72,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (343,933 ) (384,932 ) 406,462 (95,746 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (4,152 ) (9,380 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 433 54,094 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (593 ) 18,348 Total changes in debt 402,150 (32,684 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 32% at December 31, 2005, compared with 37% at December 31, 2004. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2005 Equity 2004 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,185,366 143% $ 1,783,216 118% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 117,062 161,138 Total obligations $ 2,302,428 151% $ 1,944,354 129% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total shareholders equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total shareholders equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess Ryders overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2005 was driven by our increased funding needs as a result of higher vehicle capital spending requirements, higher income tax payments and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A downgrade of Ryders debt rating below investment grade level would limit our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2005 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility is used primarily to finance working capital internationally and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. The credit facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no facility supported letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. During May 2005, the terms of the credit facility were amended thereby extending the expiration of the facility one year to 2010 and reducing the current annual facility fee from 15.0 basis points to 11.0 basis points. The annual facility fee applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2005 was 128%. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, we repaid $200 million of debentures. In September 2005, Ryder filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that were carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. The universal shelf registration statement became effective in November 2005. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) December 31, 2005, Ryder had $800 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder System, Inc., entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is similar to Ryders previous accounts receivable facility, which expired in December 2004, except that this program will be a 364 day facility. This program will be accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which would cause early termination, the program will expire on September 12, 2006, unless extended by the parties. At December 31, 2005, no receivables were sold pursuant to the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2005, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 474 Shelf registration statement 800 Trade receivables facility 200 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans and insurance companies) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be VIEs. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale and operating leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from such sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. These leases contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We did not enter into any sale and operating leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2003. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $16 million and $26 million, respectively, and we have accrued $3 million as a corresponding liability. See Note 17, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2005: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 268,716 438,880 865,837 610,113 2,183,546 Capital lease obligations 722 871 171 56 1,820 Total debt 269,438 439,751 866,008 610,169 2,185,366 Interest on debt(1) 113,332 174,251 120,934 223,016 631,533 Operating leases(2) 102,474 132,255 62,538 66,067 363,334 Purchase obligations(3) 28,794 33,543 8,975 71,312 Total contractual cash obligations 244,600 340,049 192,447 289,083 1,066,179 Insurance obligations(4) 111,163 99,107 40,156 52,814 303,240 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 13,115 1,001 17,104 31,220 Total $ 625,201 892,022 1,099,612 969,170 3,586,005 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2005. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to information technology services. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were derivative contracts, deferred compensation obligations and legal contractual obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2006, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $71 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2006 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $115 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In connection with the accrual of the additional minimum pension liability, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $221 million and $189 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which increased at December 31, 2005 as reductions in discount rates offset the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 7% in 2005. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may, from time to time, make voluntary contributions to our pension plans. During 2005, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $12 million compared with $70 million in 2004. After considering the 2005 contributions, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $115 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. Share Repurchases and Cash Dividends In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. At December 31, 2005, we had repurchased and retired approximately 2.6 million shares under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $109 million. Management has established a prearranged written plan under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allows for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We expect to complete the October 2005 program in the first quarter of 2006. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through employee stock purchase plans since May 1, 2004, which totaled approximately 2.4 million shares at December 31, 2005. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan under Rule 10b5 1 as part of the July 2004 program. In 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate, in part, the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003 up to $90 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the 2003 program. In 2004 and 2003, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million and 117,500 shares, respectively, under the 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million and $3 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $41 million in 2005, $39 million in 2004 and $38 million in 2003. During 2005, we increased our annual dividend to $0.64 per share of common stock. In February 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.16 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2005. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 16, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.5 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement totaled $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% and a fair value of $1.2 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2004 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $13 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements totaled $0.8 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $607 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $285 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2004 totaled $5 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2006 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $10 million and $16 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.1 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $9 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2005, we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004 and $1 million in 2003. We incurred environmental expenses of $9 million, $10 million and $12 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2005 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2005, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2006, which will cause depreciation expense in 2006 to decrease by approximately $13 million compared with 2005. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2006 by approximately $85 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2005, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $5 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2006 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 76% equity securities and 24% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an unrecognized loss of $428 million at the end of 2005 compared with a loss of $371 million at the end of 2004. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2005 results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and assets earning a rate of return below the assumed rates offset in part by the amortization of the opening balance. To the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. The amount of the unrecognized loss subject to amortization in 2006 will be $281 million. The effect on years beyond 2006 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2005 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2006 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2006 Net December 31, 2005 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.90% + 0.25% $5 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.90% 0.25% + $5 million + $41 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $2 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2005, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2006 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2005, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $156 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, in certain instances (typically when we manage transportation for our customers), we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis. In transportation management contracts where we act as an agent, we have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. In addition, we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments. During 2005, we entered into a significant SCS managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as principal in the arrangement. As a result, we recognized an additional $135 million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in 2005 by reporting revenue on a gross basis. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $235 million and $257 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. The amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at December 31, 2004 and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Share Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of SFAS No. 123R would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) larger fleet size. Commercial rental revenue in 2004 also benefited from revenue contributions attributed to acquisitions. FMS NBT grew $118 million in 2004 as a result of the acquisitions that allowed us to leverage our existing infrastructure, improved commercial rental results from higher rental pricing and utilization, higher gains on disposal of used revenue earning equipment from stronger pricing and volume, and lower pension costs. The impact of these items was partially offset by lower full service lease and contract maintenance revenue in our base business (excluding acquired contracts). Our global fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment and contract maintenance vehicles is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ Number of Units 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 End of period count By type: Trucks 63,200 63,700 62,400 (1 )% 2 Tractors 52,700 51,700 48,900 2 6 Trailers 40,600 43,100 43,200 (6 ) Other 5,800 5,900 5,700 (2 ) 4 Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 By product line: Full service lease 118,400 119,700 118,900 (1 )% 1 Commercial rental 40,500 41,700 38,500 (3 ) 8 Service and other vehicles 3,400 3,000 2,800 13 7 Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 Owned(1) 156,500 157,000 150,200 % 5 Leased 5,800 7,400 10,000 (22 ) (26 ) Total 162,300 164,400 160,200 (1 )% 3 Full year average 164,900 164,300 160,000 % 3 Customer vehicles under contract maintenance (end of period) 26,400 28,500 29,000 (7 )% (2 ) (1) Effective March 1, 2004, approximately 6,400 units were added to the fleet as part of the Ruan acquisition. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. NLE units represent vehicles held for sale, as well as vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. These vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to the higher level of lease vehicle replacement and increased out servicing activity of rental vehicles. In 2006, we expect the number of NLE units to remain at the current levels.

Subcontracted transportation is deducted from total revenue to arrive at our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was primarily due to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation, is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2005, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect revenue improvements to continue over the near term. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of the year. 2004 versus 2003 SCS total revenue and operating revenue declined in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain U.S. and international customer contracts. Additionally, international operating revenue in 2003 included $21 million associated with an inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. The unfavorable operating revenue comparisons were partially offset by new contract start ups and expansions in the U.S., Canada and Latin America and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Both SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. In 2004, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 30% of SCS total revenue and 19% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT declined $3 million in 2004 primarily due to lower operating revenue partially offset by reduced overhead spending resulting from continued profit improvement actions. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is deducted from total revenue to arrive at our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 DCC total and operating revenue decreased in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain customer contracts, partially offset by the pass through of higher average fuel prices. DCC NBT declined $6 million in 2004 as a result of lower revenue, increased driver costs and higher safety and insurance expenses, partially offset by lower overhead spending. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Central Support Services CSS expenses were as follows: Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Sales and marketing $ 9,143 7,636 9,158 Human resources 14,647 13,982 18,000 Finance 56,964 56,136 55,180 Corporate services and public affairs 13,028 9,196 7,314 Information technology 63,569 69,457 78,084 Health and safety 8,717 7,952 7,682 Other 41,234 48,050 37,598 Total CSS 207,302 212,409 213,016 (2 )% Allocation of CSS to business segments (171,551 ) (179,348 ) (188,584 ) 4 5 Unallocated CSS $ 35,751 33,061 24,432 8 % 35 2005 versus 2004 Total CSS costs declined in 2005 primarily due to cost benefits associated with the insourcing and renegotiation of several information technology infrastructure services and lower performance based incentive compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarters facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarters relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. We expect reductions in CSS spending levels over the near term based on continuing cost containment and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 Total CSS costs decreased in 2004 as a result of ongoing cost containment and process improvement actions, most notably in information technology (IT). This decrease was partially offset by higher performance based incentive compensation costs attributed to the improved overall performance. Technology costs were lower in 2004 due primarily to reduced pricing on purchased IT services. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2004 largely due to Sarbanes Oxley compliance costs that were not allocated to the business segments and higher performance based incentive compensation. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Financing activities 241,505 (195,760 ) (232,796 ) Investing activities (988,855 ) (720,113 ) (543,165 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (3,956 ) 9,368 8,738 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 27,756 (39,656 ) 36,390 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to improved operating performance and the add back of depreciation expense attributed to VIEs that were consolidated effective July 1, 2003. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Cash used in financing activities decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher debt borrowings and proceeds from stock option exercises were partially offset by increased stock repurchases. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher capital expenditures, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. Cash used in investing activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due to higher capital expenditures and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions. Capital expenditures increased in 2004 due to planned higher levels of vehicle replacements for equipment under lease to our customers and new lease sales. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions completed during 2004. We manage our business to maximize operating cash flows and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities as free cash flow. Although free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure, we consider it to be an important measure of comparative operating performance. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Collections on direct finance leases 70,408 63,795 61,368 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,963 42,839 13,392 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,752 288,674 196,198 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 13,181 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) (734,509 ) Acquisitions (15,110 ) (148,791 ) (96,518 ) Other, net 21,511 6,995 3,723 Free cash flow $ (209,793 ) 146,736 260,448 We used $210 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $147 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) offset by lower acquisition spending. Free cash flow decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher capital spending and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions offset better operating performance, higher proceeds from sales of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions. Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow comparisons in the first half of 2004 were also positively impacted by the add back of depreciation expense of approximately $40 million attributed to VIEs that were consolidated as a result of the adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. We anticipate negative free cash flow levels to improve in 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower income tax payments. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,082,332 862,994 459,239 Commercial rental 251,278 241,858 219,880 1,333,610 1,104,852 679,119 Operating property and equipment 77,360 59,767 46,011 Total capital expenditures 1,410,970 1,164,619 725,130 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (11,591 ) (72,461 ) 9,379 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,399,379 1,092,158 734,509 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $0.4 million, $54 million and $67 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures grew in 2005 and 2004 due primarily to increased replacement activity in our full service lease business. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels should be relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. As a result of our fleet age and anticipated higher levels of new sales and replacement activity, total capital expenditures are anticipated to increase to approximately $1.6 billion in 2006, including lease vehicle replacements of approximately $1.1 billion and spending for anticipated incremental lease growth of approximately $200 million. We expect to fund 2006 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In both 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Ryder completed two acquisitions related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $15 million in 2005, $149 million in 2004 and $97 million in 2003. Approximately $4 million is due to the sellers at December 31, 2005 and will be paid subject to holdback 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) provisions set forth in the purchase agreements. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2006. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 1,783,216 1,815,900 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 188,271 79,033 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 600,000 135,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 162,124 147,153 Retirement of debentures (200,000 ) (72,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (343,933 ) (384,932 ) 406,462 (95,746 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (4,152 ) (9,380 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 433 54,094 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (593 ) 18,348 Total changes in debt 402,150 (32,684 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 32% at December 31, 2005, compared with 37% at December 31, 2004. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2005 Equity 2004 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,185,366 143% $ 1,783,216 118% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 117,062 161,138 Total obligations $ 2,302,428 151% $ 1,944,354 129% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total shareholders equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total shareholders equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess Ryders overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2005 was driven by our increased funding needs as a result of higher vehicle capital spending requirements, higher income tax payments and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A downgrade of Ryders debt rating below investment grade level would limit our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2005 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility is used primarily to finance working capital internationally and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. The credit facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no facility supported letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. During May 2005, the terms of the credit facility were amended thereby extending the expiration of the facility one year to 2010 and reducing the current annual facility fee from 15.0 basis points to 11.0 basis points. The annual facility fee applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2005 was 128%. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, we repaid $200 million of debentures. In September 2005, Ryder filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that were carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. The universal shelf registration statement became effective in November 2005. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) December 31, 2005, Ryder had $800 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder System, Inc., entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is similar to Ryders previous accounts receivable facility, which expired in December 2004, except that this program will be a 364 day facility. This program will be accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which would cause early termination, the program will expire on September 12, 2006, unless extended by the parties. At December 31, 2005, no receivables were sold pursuant to the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2005, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 474 Shelf registration statement 800 Trade receivables facility 200 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans and insurance companies) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be VIEs. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale and operating leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from such sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. These leases contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We did not enter into any sale and operating leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2003. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $16 million and $26 million, respectively, and we have accrued $3 million as a corresponding liability. See Note 17, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2005: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 268,716 438,880 865,837 610,113 2,183,546 Capital lease obligations 722 871 171 56 1,820 Total debt 269,438 439,751 866,008 610,169 2,185,366 Interest on debt(1) 113,332 174,251 120,934 223,016 631,533 Operating leases(2) 102,474 132,255 62,538 66,067 363,334 Purchase obligations(3) 28,794 33,543 8,975 71,312 Total contractual cash obligations 244,600 340,049 192,447 289,083 1,066,179 Insurance obligations(4) 111,163 99,107 40,156 52,814 303,240 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 13,115 1,001 17,104 31,220 Total $ 625,201 892,022 1,099,612 969,170 3,586,005 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2005. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to information technology services. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were derivative contracts, deferred compensation obligations and legal contractual obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2006, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $71 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2006 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $115 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In connection with the accrual of the additional minimum pension liability, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $221 million and $189 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which increased at December 31, 2005 as reductions in discount rates offset the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 7% in 2005. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may, from time to time, make voluntary contributions to our pension plans. During 2005, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $12 million compared with $70 million in 2004. After considering the 2005 contributions, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $115 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. Share Repurchases and Cash Dividends In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. At December 31, 2005, we had repurchased and retired approximately 2.6 million shares under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $109 million. Management has established a prearranged written plan under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allows for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We expect to complete the October 2005 program in the first quarter of 2006. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through employee stock purchase plans since May 1, 2004, which totaled approximately 2.4 million shares at December 31, 2005. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan under Rule 10b5 1 as part of the July 2004 program. In 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate, in part, the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003 up to $90 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the 2003 program. In 2004 and 2003, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million and 117,500 shares, respectively, under the 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million and $3 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $41 million in 2005, $39 million in 2004 and $38 million in 2003. During 2005, we increased our annual dividend to $0.64 per share of common stock. In February 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.16 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2005. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 16, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.5 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement totaled $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% and a fair value of $1.2 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2004 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $13 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements totaled $0.8 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $607 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $285 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2004 totaled $5 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2006 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $10 million and $16 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.1 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $9 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2005, we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004 and $1 million in 2003. We incurred environmental expenses of $9 million, $10 million and $12 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2005 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2005, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2006, which will cause depreciation expense in 2006 to decrease by approximately $13 million compared with 2005. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2006 by approximately $85 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2005, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $5 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2006 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 76% equity securities and 24% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an unrecognized loss of $428 million at the end of 2005 compared with a loss of $371 million at the end of 2004. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2005 results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and assets earning a rate of return below the assumed rates offset in part by the amortization of the opening balance. To the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. The amount of the unrecognized loss subject to amortization in 2006 will be $281 million. The effect on years beyond 2006 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2005 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2006 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2006 Net December 31, 2005 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.90% + 0.25% $5 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.90% 0.25% + $5 million + $41 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $2 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2005, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2006 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2005, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $156 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, in certain instances (typically when we manage transportation for our customers), we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis. In transportation management contracts where we act as an agent, we have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. In addition, we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments. During 2005, we entered into a significant SCS managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as principal in the arrangement. As a result, we recognized an additional $135 million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in 2005 by reporting revenue on a gross basis. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $235 million and $257 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. The amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at December 31, 2004 and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Share Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of SFAS No. 123R would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax benefits and headquarters complex sale. We believe that the comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The totals in the table above include the following non revenue earning equipment for the U.S. fleet (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): December 31 Number of Units 2005 2004 Change Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 1,700 1,900 (11 )% No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale 4,700 4,800 (2 ) Other NLE units 2,200 1,600 38 Total(1) 8,600 8,300 4 % (1) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,500 vehicles in 2005 and 2004, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. NLE units represent vehicles held for sale, as well as vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. These vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to the higher level of lease vehicle replacement and increased out servicing activity of rental vehicles. In 2006, we expect the number of NLE units to remain at the current levels.

Subcontracted transportation is deducted from total revenue to arrive at our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was primarily due to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation, is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2005, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect revenue improvements to continue over the near term. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of the year. 2004 versus 2003 SCS total revenue and operating revenue declined in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain U.S. and international customer contracts. Additionally, international operating revenue in 2003 included $21 million associated with an inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. The unfavorable operating revenue comparisons were partially offset by new contract start ups and expansions in the U.S., Canada and Latin America and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Both SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. In 2004, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 30% of SCS total revenue and 19% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT declined $3 million in 2004 primarily due to lower operating revenue partially offset by reduced overhead spending resulting from continued profit improvement actions. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is deducted from total revenue to arrive at our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 DCC total and operating revenue decreased in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain customer contracts, partially offset by the pass through of higher average fuel prices. DCC NBT declined $6 million in 2004 as a result of lower revenue, increased driver costs and higher safety and insurance expenses, partially offset by lower overhead spending. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Central Support Services CSS expenses were as follows: Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Sales and marketing $ 9,143 7,636 9,158 Human resources 14,647 13,982 18,000 Finance 56,964 56,136 55,180 Corporate services and public affairs 13,028 9,196 7,314 Information technology 63,569 69,457 78,084 Health and safety 8,717 7,952 7,682 Other 41,234 48,050 37,598 Total CSS 207,302 212,409 213,016 (2 )% Allocation of CSS to business segments (171,551 ) (179,348 ) (188,584 ) 4 5 Unallocated CSS $ 35,751 33,061 24,432 8 % 35 2005 versus 2004 Total CSS costs declined in 2005 primarily due to cost benefits associated with the insourcing and renegotiation of several information technology infrastructure services and lower performance based incentive compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarters facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarters relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. We expect reductions in CSS spending levels over the near term based on continuing cost containment and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 Total CSS costs decreased in 2004 as a result of ongoing cost containment and process improvement actions, most notably in information technology (IT). This decrease was partially offset by higher performance based incentive compensation costs attributed to the improved overall performance. Technology costs were lower in 2004 due primarily to reduced pricing on purchased IT services. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2004 largely due to Sarbanes Oxley compliance costs that were not allocated to the business segments and higher performance based incentive compensation. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Financing activities 241,505 (195,760 ) (232,796 ) Investing activities (988,855 ) (720,113 ) (543,165 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (3,956 ) 9,368 8,738 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 27,756 (39,656 ) 36,390 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to improved operating performance and the add back of depreciation expense attributed to VIEs that were consolidated effective July 1, 2003. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Cash used in financing activities decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher debt borrowings and proceeds from stock option exercises were partially offset by increased stock repurchases. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher capital expenditures, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. Cash used in investing activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due to higher capital expenditures and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions. Capital expenditures increased in 2004 due to planned higher levels of vehicle replacements for equipment under lease to our customers and new lease sales. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions completed during 2004. We manage our business to maximize operating cash flows and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities as free cash flow. Although free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure, we consider it to be an important measure of comparative operating performance. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Collections on direct finance leases 70,408 63,795 61,368 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,963 42,839 13,392 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,752 288,674 196,198 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 13,181 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) (734,509 ) Acquisitions (15,110 ) (148,791 ) (96,518 ) Other, net 21,511 6,995 3,723 Free cash flow $ (209,793 ) 146,736 260,448 We used $210 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $147 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) offset by lower acquisition spending. Free cash flow decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher capital spending and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions offset better operating performance, higher proceeds from sales of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions. Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow comparisons in the first half of 2004 were also positively impacted by the add back of depreciation expense of approximately $40 million attributed to VIEs that were consolidated as a result of the adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. We anticipate negative free cash flow levels to improve in 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower income tax payments. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,082,332 862,994 459,239 Commercial rental 251,278 241,858 219,880 1,333,610 1,104,852 679,119 Operating property and equipment 77,360 59,767 46,011 Total capital expenditures 1,410,970 1,164,619 725,130 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (11,591 ) (72,461 ) 9,379 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,399,379 1,092,158 734,509 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $0.4 million, $54 million and $67 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures grew in 2005 and 2004 due primarily to increased replacement activity in our full service lease business. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels should be relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. As a result of our fleet age and anticipated higher levels of new sales and replacement activity, total capital expenditures are anticipated to increase to approximately $1.6 billion in 2006, including lease vehicle replacements of approximately $1.1 billion and spending for anticipated incremental lease growth of approximately $200 million. We expect to fund 2006 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In both 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Ryder completed two acquisitions related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $15 million in 2005, $149 million in 2004 and $97 million in 2003. Approximately $4 million is due to the sellers at December 31, 2005 and will be paid subject to holdback 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) provisions set forth in the purchase agreements. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2006. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 1,783,216 1,815,900 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 188,271 79,033 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 600,000 135,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 162,124 147,153 Retirement of debentures (200,000 ) (72,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (343,933 ) (384,932 ) 406,462 (95,746 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (4,152 ) (9,380 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 433 54,094 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (593 ) 18,348 Total changes in debt 402,150 (32,684 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 32% at December 31, 2005, compared with 37% at December 31, 2004. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2005 Equity 2004 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,185,366 143% $ 1,783,216 118% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 117,062 161,138 Total obligations $ 2,302,428 151% $ 1,944,354 129% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total shareholders equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total shareholders equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess Ryders overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2005 was driven by our increased funding needs as a result of higher vehicle capital spending requirements, higher income tax payments and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A downgrade of Ryders debt rating below investment grade level would limit our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2005 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility is used primarily to finance working capital internationally and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. The credit facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no facility supported letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. During May 2005, the terms of the credit facility were amended thereby extending the expiration of the facility one year to 2010 and reducing the current annual facility fee from 15.0 basis points to 11.0 basis points. The annual facility fee applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2005 was 128%. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, we repaid $200 million of debentures. In September 2005, Ryder filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that were carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. The universal shelf registration statement became effective in November 2005. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) December 31, 2005, Ryder had $800 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder System, Inc., entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is similar to Ryders previous accounts receivable facility, which expired in December 2004, except that this program will be a 364 day facility. This program will be accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which would cause early termination, the program will expire on September 12, 2006, unless extended by the parties. At December 31, 2005, no receivables were sold pursuant to the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2005, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 474 Shelf registration statement 800 Trade receivables facility 200 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans and insurance companies) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be VIEs. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale and operating leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from such sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. These leases contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We did not enter into any sale and operating leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2003. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $16 million and $26 million, respectively, and we have accrued $3 million as a corresponding liability. See Note 17, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2005: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 268,716 438,880 865,837 610,113 2,183,546 Capital lease obligations 722 871 171 56 1,820 Total debt 269,438 439,751 866,008 610,169 2,185,366 Interest on debt(1) 113,332 174,251 120,934 223,016 631,533 Operating leases(2) 102,474 132,255 62,538 66,067 363,334 Purchase obligations(3) 28,794 33,543 8,975 71,312 Total contractual cash obligations 244,600 340,049 192,447 289,083 1,066,179 Insurance obligations(4) 111,163 99,107 40,156 52,814 303,240 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 13,115 1,001 17,104 31,220 Total $ 625,201 892,022 1,099,612 969,170 3,586,005 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2005. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to information technology services. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were derivative contracts, deferred compensation obligations and legal contractual obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2006, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $71 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2006 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $115 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In connection with the accrual of the additional minimum pension liability, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $221 million and $189 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which increased at December 31, 2005 as reductions in discount rates offset the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 7% in 2005. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may, from time to time, make voluntary contributions to our pension plans. During 2005, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $12 million compared with $70 million in 2004. After considering the 2005 contributions, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $115 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. Share Repurchases and Cash Dividends In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. At December 31, 2005, we had repurchased and retired approximately 2.6 million shares under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $109 million. Management has established a prearranged written plan under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allows for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We expect to complete the October 2005 program in the first quarter of 2006. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through employee stock purchase plans since May 1, 2004, which totaled approximately 2.4 million shares at December 31, 2005. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan under Rule 10b5 1 as part of the July 2004 program. In 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate, in part, the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003 up to $90 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the 2003 program. In 2004 and 2003, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million and 117,500 shares, respectively, under the 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million and $3 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $41 million in 2005, $39 million in 2004 and $38 million in 2003. During 2005, we increased our annual dividend to $0.64 per share of common stock. In February 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.16 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2005. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 16, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.5 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement totaled $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% and a fair value of $1.2 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2004 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $13 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements totaled $0.8 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $607 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $285 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2004 totaled $5 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2006 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $10 million and $16 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.1 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $9 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2005, we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004 and $1 million in 2003. We incurred environmental expenses of $9 million, $10 million and $12 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2005 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2005, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2006, which will cause depreciation expense in 2006 to decrease by approximately $13 million compared with 2005. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2006 by approximately $85 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2005, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $5 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2006 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 76% equity securities and 24% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an unrecognized loss of $428 million at the end of 2005 compared with a loss of $371 million at the end of 2004. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2005 results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and assets earning a rate of return below the assumed rates offset in part by the amortization of the opening balance. To the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. The amount of the unrecognized loss subject to amortization in 2006 will be $281 million. The effect on years beyond 2006 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2005 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2006 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2006 Net December 31, 2005 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.90% + 0.25% $5 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.90% 0.25% + $5 million + $41 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $2 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2005, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2006 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2005, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $156 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, in certain instances (typically when we manage transportation for our customers), we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis. In transportation management contracts where we act as an agent, we have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. In addition, we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments. During 2005, we entered into a significant SCS managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as principal in the arrangement. As a result, we recognized an additional $135 million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in 2005 by reporting revenue on a gross basis. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $235 million and $257 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. The amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at December 31, 2004 and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Share Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of SFAS No. 123R would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax benefits and headquarters complex sale. We believe that the comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was primarily due to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation, is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2005, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect revenue improvements to continue over the near term. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of the year. 2004 versus 2003 SCS total revenue and operating revenue declined in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain U.S. and international customer contracts. Additionally, international operating revenue in 2003 included $21 million associated with an inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk, that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. The unfavorable operating revenue comparisons were partially offset by new contract start ups and expansions in the U.S., Canada and Latin America and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Both SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.6%. In 2004, General Motors Corporation accounted for approximately 30% of SCS total revenue and 19% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT declined $3 million in 2004 primarily due to lower operating revenue partially offset by reduced overhead spending resulting from continued profit improvement actions. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is deducted from total revenue to arrive at our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 DCC total and operating revenue decreased in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain customer contracts, partially offset by the pass through of higher average fuel prices. DCC NBT declined $6 million in 2004 as a result of lower revenue, increased driver costs and higher safety and insurance expenses, partially offset by lower overhead spending. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarters facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarters relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. We expect reductions in CSS spending levels over the near term based on continuing cost containment and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 Total CSS costs decreased in 2004 as a result of ongoing cost containment and process improvement actions, most notably in information technology (IT). This decrease was partially offset by higher performance based incentive compensation costs attributed to the improved overall performance. Technology costs were lower in 2004 due primarily to reduced pricing on purchased IT services. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2004 largely due to Sarbanes Oxley compliance costs that were not allocated to the business segments and higher performance based incentive compensation. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Financing activities 241,505 (195,760 ) (232,796 ) Investing activities (988,855 ) (720,113 ) (543,165 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (3,956 ) 9,368 8,738 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 27,756 (39,656 ) 36,390 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to improved operating performance and the add back of depreciation expense attributed to VIEs that were consolidated effective July 1, 2003. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Cash used in financing activities decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher debt borrowings and proceeds from stock option exercises were partially offset by increased stock repurchases. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher capital expenditures, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. Cash used in investing activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due to higher capital expenditures and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions. Capital expenditures increased in 2004 due to planned higher levels of vehicle replacements for equipment under lease to our customers and new lease sales. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions completed during 2004. We manage our business to maximize operating cash flows and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities as free cash flow. Although free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure, we consider it to be an important measure of comparative operating performance. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Collections on direct finance leases 70,408 63,795 61,368 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,963 42,839 13,392 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,752 288,674 196,198 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 13,181 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) (734,509 ) Acquisitions (15,110 ) (148,791 ) (96,518 ) Other, net 21,511 6,995 3,723 Free cash flow $ (209,793 ) 146,736 260,448 We used $210 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $147 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) offset by lower acquisition spending. Free cash flow decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher capital spending and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions offset better operating performance, higher proceeds from sales of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions. Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow comparisons in the first half of 2004 were also positively impacted by the add back of depreciation expense of approximately $40 million attributed to VIEs that were consolidated as a result of the adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. We anticipate negative free cash flow levels to improve in 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower income tax payments. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,082,332 862,994 459,239 Commercial rental 251,278 241,858 219,880 1,333,610 1,104,852 679,119 Operating property and equipment 77,360 59,767 46,011 Total capital expenditures 1,410,970 1,164,619 725,130 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (11,591 ) (72,461 ) 9,379 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,399,379 1,092,158 734,509 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $0.4 million, $54 million and $67 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures grew in 2005 and 2004 due primarily to increased replacement activity in our full service lease business. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels should be relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. As a result of our fleet age and anticipated higher levels of new sales and replacement activity, total capital expenditures are anticipated to increase to approximately $1.6 billion in 2006, including lease vehicle replacements of approximately $1.1 billion and spending for anticipated incremental lease growth of approximately $200 million. We expect to fund 2006 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In both 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Ryder completed two acquisitions related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $15 million in 2005, $149 million in 2004 and $97 million in 2003. Approximately $4 million is due to the sellers at December 31, 2005 and will be paid subject to holdback 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) provisions set forth in the purchase agreements. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2006. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 1,783,216 1,815,900 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 188,271 79,033 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 600,000 135,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 162,124 147,153 Retirement of debentures (200,000 ) (72,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (343,933 ) (384,932 ) 406,462 (95,746 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (4,152 ) (9,380 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 433 54,094 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (593 ) 18,348 Total changes in debt 402,150 (32,684 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 32% at December 31, 2005, compared with 37% at December 31, 2004. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2005 Equity 2004 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,185,366 143% $ 1,783,216 118% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 117,062 161,138 Total obligations $ 2,302,428 151% $ 1,944,354 129% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total shareholders equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total shareholders equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess Ryders overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2005 was driven by our increased funding needs as a result of higher vehicle capital spending requirements, higher income tax payments and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A downgrade of Ryders debt rating below investment grade level would limit our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2005 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility is used primarily to finance working capital internationally and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. The credit facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no facility supported letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. During May 2005, the terms of the credit facility were amended thereby extending the expiration of the facility one year to 2010 and reducing the current annual facility fee from 15.0 basis points to 11.0 basis points. The annual facility fee applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2005 was 128%. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, we repaid $200 million of debentures. In September 2005, Ryder filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that were carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. The universal shelf registration statement became effective in November 2005. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) December 31, 2005, Ryder had $800 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder System, Inc., entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is similar to Ryders previous accounts receivable facility, which expired in December 2004, except that this program will be a 364 day facility. This program will be accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which would cause early termination, the program will expire on September 12, 2006, unless extended by the parties. At December 31, 2005, no receivables were sold pursuant to the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2005, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 474 Shelf registration statement 800 Trade receivables facility 200 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans and insurance companies) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be VIEs. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale and operating leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from such sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. These leases contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We did not enter into any sale and operating leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2003. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $16 million and $26 million, respectively, and we have accrued $3 million as a corresponding liability. See Note 17, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2005: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 268,716 438,880 865,837 610,113 2,183,546 Capital lease obligations 722 871 171 56 1,820 Total debt 269,438 439,751 866,008 610,169 2,185,366 Interest on debt(1) 113,332 174,251 120,934 223,016 631,533 Operating leases(2) 102,474 132,255 62,538 66,067 363,334 Purchase obligations(3) 28,794 33,543 8,975 71,312 Total contractual cash obligations 244,600 340,049 192,447 289,083 1,066,179 Insurance obligations(4) 111,163 99,107 40,156 52,814 303,240 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 13,115 1,001 17,104 31,220 Total $ 625,201 892,022 1,099,612 969,170 3,586,005 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2005. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to information technology services. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were derivative contracts, deferred compensation obligations and legal contractual obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2006, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $71 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2006 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $115 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In connection with the accrual of the additional minimum pension liability, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $221 million and $189 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which increased at December 31, 2005 as reductions in discount rates offset the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 7% in 2005. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may, from time to time, make voluntary contributions to our pension plans. During 2005, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $12 million compared with $70 million in 2004. After considering the 2005 contributions, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $115 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. Share Repurchases and Cash Dividends In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. At December 31, 2005, we had repurchased and retired approximately 2.6 million shares under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $109 million. Management has established a prearranged written plan under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allows for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We expect to complete the October 2005 program in the first quarter of 2006. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through employee stock purchase plans since May 1, 2004, which totaled approximately 2.4 million shares at December 31, 2005. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan under Rule 10b5 1 as part of the July 2004 program. In 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate, in part, the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003 up to $90 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the 2003 program. In 2004 and 2003, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million and 117,500 shares, respectively, under the 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million and $3 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $41 million in 2005, $39 million in 2004 and $38 million in 2003. During 2005, we increased our annual dividend to $0.64 per share of common stock. In February 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.16 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2005. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 16, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.5 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement totaled $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% and a fair value of $1.2 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2004 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $13 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements totaled $0.8 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $607 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $285 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2004 totaled $5 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2006 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $10 million and $16 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.1 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $9 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2005, we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004 and $1 million in 2003. We incurred environmental expenses of $9 million, $10 million and $12 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2005 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2005, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2006, which will cause depreciation expense in 2006 to decrease by approximately $13 million compared with 2005. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2006 by approximately $85 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2005, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $5 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2006 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 76% equity securities and 24% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an unrecognized loss of $428 million at the end of 2005 compared with a loss of $371 million at the end of 2004. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2005 results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and assets earning a rate of return below the assumed rates offset in part by the amortization of the opening balance. To the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. The amount of the unrecognized loss subject to amortization in 2006 will be $281 million. The effect on years beyond 2006 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2005 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2006 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2006 Net December 31, 2005 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.90% + 0.25% $5 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.90% 0.25% + $5 million + $41 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $2 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2005, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2006 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2005, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $156 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, in certain instances (typically when we manage transportation for our customers), we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis. In transportation management contracts where we act as an agent, we have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. In addition, we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments. During 2005, we entered into a significant SCS managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as principal in the arrangement. As a result, we recognized an additional $135 million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in 2005 by reporting revenue on a gross basis. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $235 million and $257 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. The amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at December 31, 2004 and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Share Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of SFAS No. 123R would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax benefits and headquarters complex sale. We believe that the comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Forward looking statements (within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) are statements that relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends concerning matters that are not historical facts.

Subcontracted transportation is deducted from total revenue to arrive at our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 DCC total and operating revenue decreased in 2004 due to the non renewal of certain customer contracts, partially offset by the pass through of higher average fuel prices. DCC NBT declined $6 million in 2004 as a result of lower revenue, increased driver costs and higher safety and insurance expenses, partially offset by lower overhead spending. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Central Support Services CSS expenses were as follows: Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Sales and marketing $ 9,143 7,636 9,158 Human resources 14,647 13,982 18,000 Finance 56,964 56,136 55,180 Corporate services and public affairs 13,028 9,196 7,314 Information technology 63,569 69,457 78,084 Health and safety 8,717 7,952 7,682 Other 41,234 48,050 37,598 Total CSS 207,302 212,409 213,016 (2 )% Allocation of CSS to business segments (171,551 ) (179,348 ) (188,584 ) 4 5 Unallocated CSS $ 35,751 33,061 24,432 8 % 35 2005 versus 2004 Total CSS costs declined in 2005 primarily due to cost benefits associated with the insourcing and renegotiation of several information technology infrastructure services and lower performance based incentive compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarters facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarters relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. We expect reductions in CSS spending levels over the near term based on continuing cost containment and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 Total CSS costs decreased in 2004 as a result of ongoing cost containment and process improvement actions, most notably in information technology (IT). This decrease was partially offset by higher performance based incentive compensation costs attributed to the improved overall performance. Technology costs were lower in 2004 due primarily to reduced pricing on purchased IT services. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2004 largely due to Sarbanes Oxley compliance costs that were not allocated to the business segments and higher performance based incentive compensation. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Financing activities 241,505 (195,760 ) (232,796 ) Investing activities (988,855 ) (720,113 ) (543,165 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (3,956 ) 9,368 8,738 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 27,756 (39,656 ) 36,390 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to improved operating performance and the add back of depreciation expense attributed to VIEs that were consolidated effective July 1, 2003. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Cash used in financing activities decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher debt borrowings and proceeds from stock option exercises were partially offset by increased stock repurchases. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher capital expenditures, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. Cash used in investing activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due to higher capital expenditures and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions. Capital expenditures increased in 2004 due to planned higher levels of vehicle replacements for equipment under lease to our customers and new lease sales. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions completed during 2004. We manage our business to maximize operating cash flows and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities as free cash flow. Although free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure, we consider it to be an important measure of comparative operating performance. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Collections on direct finance leases 70,408 63,795 61,368 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,963 42,839 13,392 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,752 288,674 196,198 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 13,181 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) (734,509 ) Acquisitions (15,110 ) (148,791 ) (96,518 ) Other, net 21,511 6,995 3,723 Free cash flow $ (209,793 ) 146,736 260,448 We used $210 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $147 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) offset by lower acquisition spending. Free cash flow decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher capital spending and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions offset better operating performance, higher proceeds from sales of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions. Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow comparisons in the first half of 2004 were also positively impacted by the add back of depreciation expense of approximately $40 million attributed to VIEs that were consolidated as a result of the adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. We anticipate negative free cash flow levels to improve in 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower income tax payments. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,082,332 862,994 459,239 Commercial rental 251,278 241,858 219,880 1,333,610 1,104,852 679,119 Operating property and equipment 77,360 59,767 46,011 Total capital expenditures 1,410,970 1,164,619 725,130 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (11,591 ) (72,461 ) 9,379 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,399,379 1,092,158 734,509 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $0.4 million, $54 million and $67 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures grew in 2005 and 2004 due primarily to increased replacement activity in our full service lease business. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels should be relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. As a result of our fleet age and anticipated higher levels of new sales and replacement activity, total capital expenditures are anticipated to increase to approximately $1.6 billion in 2006, including lease vehicle replacements of approximately $1.1 billion and spending for anticipated incremental lease growth of approximately $200 million. We expect to fund 2006 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In both 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Ryder completed two acquisitions related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $15 million in 2005, $149 million in 2004 and $97 million in 2003. Approximately $4 million is due to the sellers at December 31, 2005 and will be paid subject to holdback 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) provisions set forth in the purchase agreements. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2006. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 1,783,216 1,815,900 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 188,271 79,033 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 600,000 135,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 162,124 147,153 Retirement of debentures (200,000 ) (72,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (343,933 ) (384,932 ) 406,462 (95,746 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (4,152 ) (9,380 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 433 54,094 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (593 ) 18,348 Total changes in debt 402,150 (32,684 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 32% at December 31, 2005, compared with 37% at December 31, 2004. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2005 Equity 2004 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,185,366 143% $ 1,783,216 118% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 117,062 161,138 Total obligations $ 2,302,428 151% $ 1,944,354 129% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total shareholders equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total shareholders equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess Ryders overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2005 was driven by our increased funding needs as a result of higher vehicle capital spending requirements, higher income tax payments and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A downgrade of Ryders debt rating below investment grade level would limit our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2005 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility is used primarily to finance working capital internationally and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. The credit facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no facility supported letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. During May 2005, the terms of the credit facility were amended thereby extending the expiration of the facility one year to 2010 and reducing the current annual facility fee from 15.0 basis points to 11.0 basis points. The annual facility fee applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2005 was 128%. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, we repaid $200 million of debentures. In September 2005, Ryder filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that were carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. The universal shelf registration statement became effective in November 2005. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) December 31, 2005, Ryder had $800 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder System, Inc., entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is similar to Ryders previous accounts receivable facility, which expired in December 2004, except that this program will be a 364 day facility. This program will be accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which would cause early termination, the program will expire on September 12, 2006, unless extended by the parties. At December 31, 2005, no receivables were sold pursuant to the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2005, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 474 Shelf registration statement 800 Trade receivables facility 200 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans and insurance companies) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be VIEs. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale and operating leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from such sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. These leases contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We did not enter into any sale and operating leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2003. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $16 million and $26 million, respectively, and we have accrued $3 million as a corresponding liability. See Note 17, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2005: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 268,716 438,880 865,837 610,113 2,183,546 Capital lease obligations 722 871 171 56 1,820 Total debt 269,438 439,751 866,008 610,169 2,185,366 Interest on debt(1) 113,332 174,251 120,934 223,016 631,533 Operating leases(2) 102,474 132,255 62,538 66,067 363,334 Purchase obligations(3) 28,794 33,543 8,975 71,312 Total contractual cash obligations 244,600 340,049 192,447 289,083 1,066,179 Insurance obligations(4) 111,163 99,107 40,156 52,814 303,240 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 13,115 1,001 17,104 31,220 Total $ 625,201 892,022 1,099,612 969,170 3,586,005 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2005. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to information technology services. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were derivative contracts, deferred compensation obligations and legal contractual obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2006, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $71 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2006 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $115 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In connection with the accrual of the additional minimum pension liability, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $221 million and $189 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which increased at December 31, 2005 as reductions in discount rates offset the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 7% in 2005. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may, from time to time, make voluntary contributions to our pension plans. During 2005, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $12 million compared with $70 million in 2004. After considering the 2005 contributions, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $115 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. Share Repurchases and Cash Dividends In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. At December 31, 2005, we had repurchased and retired approximately 2.6 million shares under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $109 million. Management has established a prearranged written plan under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allows for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We expect to complete the October 2005 program in the first quarter of 2006. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through employee stock purchase plans since May 1, 2004, which totaled approximately 2.4 million shares at December 31, 2005. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan under Rule 10b5 1 as part of the July 2004 program. In 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate, in part, the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003 up to $90 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the 2003 program. In 2004 and 2003, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million and 117,500 shares, respectively, under the 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million and $3 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $41 million in 2005, $39 million in 2004 and $38 million in 2003. During 2005, we increased our annual dividend to $0.64 per share of common stock. In February 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.16 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2005. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 16, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.5 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement totaled $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% and a fair value of $1.2 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2004 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $13 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements totaled $0.8 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $607 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $285 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2004 totaled $5 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2006 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $10 million and $16 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.1 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $9 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2005, we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004 and $1 million in 2003. We incurred environmental expenses of $9 million, $10 million and $12 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2005 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2005, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2006, which will cause depreciation expense in 2006 to decrease by approximately $13 million compared with 2005. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2006 by approximately $85 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2005, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $5 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2006 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 76% equity securities and 24% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an unrecognized loss of $428 million at the end of 2005 compared with a loss of $371 million at the end of 2004. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2005 results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and assets earning a rate of return below the assumed rates offset in part by the amortization of the opening balance. To the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. The amount of the unrecognized loss subject to amortization in 2006 will be $281 million. The effect on years beyond 2006 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2005 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2006 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2006 Net December 31, 2005 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.90% + 0.25% $5 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.90% 0.25% + $5 million + $41 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $2 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2005, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2006 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2005, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $156 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, in certain instances (typically when we manage transportation for our customers), we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis. In transportation management contracts where we act as an agent, we have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. In addition, we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments. During 2005, we entered into a significant SCS managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as principal in the arrangement. As a result, we recognized an additional $135 million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in 2005 by reporting revenue on a gross basis. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $235 million and $257 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. The amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at December 31, 2004 and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Share Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of SFAS No. 123R would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax benefits and headquarters complex sale. We believe that the comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Central Support Services CSS expenses were as follows: Years ended December 31 Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Sales and marketing $ 9,143 7,636 9,158 Human resources 14,647 13,982 18,000 Finance 56,964 56,136 55,180 Corporate services and public affairs 13,028 9,196 7,314 Information technology 63,569 69,457 78,084 Health and safety 8,717 7,952 7,682 Other 41,234 48,050 37,598 Total CSS 207,302 212,409 213,016 (2 )% Allocation of CSS to business segments (171,551 ) (179,348 ) (188,584 ) 4 5 Unallocated CSS $ 35,751 33,061 24,432 8 % 35 2005 versus 2004 Total CSS costs declined in 2005 primarily due to cost benefits associated with the insourcing and renegotiation of several information technology infrastructure services and lower performance based incentive compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarters facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarters relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. We expect reductions in CSS spending levels over the near term based on continuing cost containment and process improvement actions. 2004 versus 2003 Total CSS costs decreased in 2004 as a result of ongoing cost containment and process improvement actions, most notably in information technology (IT). This decrease was partially offset by higher performance based incentive compensation costs attributed to the improved overall performance. Technology costs were lower in 2004 due primarily to reduced pricing on purchased IT services. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2004 largely due to Sarbanes Oxley compliance costs that were not allocated to the business segments and higher performance based incentive compensation. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Financing activities 241,505 (195,760 ) (232,796 ) Investing activities (988,855 ) (720,113 ) (543,165 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (3,956 ) 9,368 8,738 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 27,756 (39,656 ) 36,390 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to improved operating performance and the add back of depreciation expense attributed to VIEs that were consolidated effective July 1, 2003. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Cash used in financing activities decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher debt borrowings and proceeds from stock option exercises were partially offset by increased stock repurchases. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher capital expenditures, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. Cash used in investing activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due to higher capital expenditures and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions. Capital expenditures increased in 2004 due to planned higher levels of vehicle replacements for equipment under lease to our customers and new lease sales. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions completed during 2004. We manage our business to maximize operating cash flows and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities as free cash flow. Although free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure, we consider it to be an important measure of comparative operating performance. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Collections on direct finance leases 70,408 63,795 61,368 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,963 42,839 13,392 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,752 288,674 196,198 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 13,181 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) (734,509 ) Acquisitions (15,110 ) (148,791 ) (96,518 ) Other, net 21,511 6,995 3,723 Free cash flow $ (209,793 ) 146,736 260,448 We used $210 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $147 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) offset by lower acquisition spending. Free cash flow decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher capital spending and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions offset better operating performance, higher proceeds from sales of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions. Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow comparisons in the first half of 2004 were also positively impacted by the add back of depreciation expense of approximately $40 million attributed to VIEs that were consolidated as a result of the adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. We anticipate negative free cash flow levels to improve in 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower income tax payments. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,082,332 862,994 459,239 Commercial rental 251,278 241,858 219,880 1,333,610 1,104,852 679,119 Operating property and equipment 77,360 59,767 46,011 Total capital expenditures 1,410,970 1,164,619 725,130 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (11,591 ) (72,461 ) 9,379 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,399,379 1,092,158 734,509 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $0.4 million, $54 million and $67 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures grew in 2005 and 2004 due primarily to increased replacement activity in our full service lease business. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels should be relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. As a result of our fleet age and anticipated higher levels of new sales and replacement activity, total capital expenditures are anticipated to increase to approximately $1.6 billion in 2006, including lease vehicle replacements of approximately $1.1 billion and spending for anticipated incremental lease growth of approximately $200 million. We expect to fund 2006 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In both 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Ryder completed two acquisitions related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $15 million in 2005, $149 million in 2004 and $97 million in 2003. Approximately $4 million is due to the sellers at December 31, 2005 and will be paid subject to holdback 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) provisions set forth in the purchase agreements. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2006. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 1,783,216 1,815,900 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 188,271 79,033 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 600,000 135,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 162,124 147,153 Retirement of debentures (200,000 ) (72,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (343,933 ) (384,932 ) 406,462 (95,746 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (4,152 ) (9,380 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 433 54,094 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (593 ) 18,348 Total changes in debt 402,150 (32,684 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 32% at December 31, 2005, compared with 37% at December 31, 2004. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2005 Equity 2004 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,185,366 143% $ 1,783,216 118% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 117,062 161,138 Total obligations $ 2,302,428 151% $ 1,944,354 129% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total shareholders equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total shareholders equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess Ryders overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2005 was driven by our increased funding needs as a result of higher vehicle capital spending requirements, higher income tax payments and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A downgrade of Ryders debt rating below investment grade level would limit our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2005 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility is used primarily to finance working capital internationally and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. The credit facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no facility supported letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. During May 2005, the terms of the credit facility were amended thereby extending the expiration of the facility one year to 2010 and reducing the current annual facility fee from 15.0 basis points to 11.0 basis points. The annual facility fee applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2005 was 128%. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, we repaid $200 million of debentures. In September 2005, Ryder filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that were carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. The universal shelf registration statement became effective in November 2005. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) December 31, 2005, Ryder had $800 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder System, Inc., entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is similar to Ryders previous accounts receivable facility, which expired in December 2004, except that this program will be a 364 day facility. This program will be accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which would cause early termination, the program will expire on September 12, 2006, unless extended by the parties. At December 31, 2005, no receivables were sold pursuant to the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2005, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 474 Shelf registration statement 800 Trade receivables facility 200 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans and insurance companies) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be VIEs. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale and operating leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from such sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. These leases contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We did not enter into any sale and operating leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2003. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $16 million and $26 million, respectively, and we have accrued $3 million as a corresponding liability. See Note 17, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2005: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 268,716 438,880 865,837 610,113 2,183,546 Capital lease obligations 722 871 171 56 1,820 Total debt 269,438 439,751 866,008 610,169 2,185,366 Interest on debt(1) 113,332 174,251 120,934 223,016 631,533 Operating leases(2) 102,474 132,255 62,538 66,067 363,334 Purchase obligations(3) 28,794 33,543 8,975 71,312 Total contractual cash obligations 244,600 340,049 192,447 289,083 1,066,179 Insurance obligations(4) 111,163 99,107 40,156 52,814 303,240 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 13,115 1,001 17,104 31,220 Total $ 625,201 892,022 1,099,612 969,170 3,586,005 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2005. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to information technology services. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were derivative contracts, deferred compensation obligations and legal contractual obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2006, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $71 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2006 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $115 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In connection with the accrual of the additional minimum pension liability, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $221 million and $189 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which increased at December 31, 2005 as reductions in discount rates offset the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 7% in 2005. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may, from time to time, make voluntary contributions to our pension plans. During 2005, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $12 million compared with $70 million in 2004. After considering the 2005 contributions, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $115 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. Share Repurchases and Cash Dividends In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. At December 31, 2005, we had repurchased and retired approximately 2.6 million shares under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $109 million. Management has established a prearranged written plan under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allows for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We expect to complete the October 2005 program in the first quarter of 2006. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through employee stock purchase plans since May 1, 2004, which totaled approximately 2.4 million shares at December 31, 2005. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan under Rule 10b5 1 as part of the July 2004 program. In 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate, in part, the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003 up to $90 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the 2003 program. In 2004 and 2003, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million and 117,500 shares, respectively, under the 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million and $3 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $41 million in 2005, $39 million in 2004 and $38 million in 2003. During 2005, we increased our annual dividend to $0.64 per share of common stock. In February 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.16 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2005. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 16, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.5 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement totaled $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% and a fair value of $1.2 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2004 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $13 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements totaled $0.8 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $607 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $285 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2004 totaled $5 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2006 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $10 million and $16 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.1 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $9 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2005, we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004 and $1 million in 2003. We incurred environmental expenses of $9 million, $10 million and $12 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2005 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2005, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2006, which will cause depreciation expense in 2006 to decrease by approximately $13 million compared with 2005. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2006 by approximately $85 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2005, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $5 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2006 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 76% equity securities and 24% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an unrecognized loss of $428 million at the end of 2005 compared with a loss of $371 million at the end of 2004. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2005 results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and assets earning a rate of return below the assumed rates offset in part by the amortization of the opening balance. To the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. The amount of the unrecognized loss subject to amortization in 2006 will be $281 million. The effect on years beyond 2006 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2005 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2006 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2006 Net December 31, 2005 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.90% + 0.25% $5 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.90% 0.25% + $5 million + $41 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $2 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2005, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2006 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2005, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $156 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, in certain instances (typically when we manage transportation for our customers), we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis. In transportation management contracts where we act as an agent, we have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. In addition, we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments. During 2005, we entered into a significant SCS managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as principal in the arrangement. As a result, we recognized an additional $135 million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in 2005 by reporting revenue on a gross basis. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $235 million and $257 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. The amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at December 31, 2004 and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Share Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of SFAS No. 123R would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax benefits and headquarters complex sale. We believe that the comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Forward looking statements (within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) are statements that relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends concerning matters that are not historical facts.

This Annual Report contains forward looking statements including, but not limited to, statements regarding: our expectations as to anticipated revenue and earnings growth across all business segments; our ability to improve our competitive advantage by leveraging our vehicle buying power, reducing vehicle downtime, providing innovative broad based supply chain solutions and increasing our customers competitive positions; anticipated gains on the sale of used vehicles; the impact of the restructuring activities and growth initiatives on our FMS business segment; our ability to successfully achieve the operational goals that are the basis of our business strategies, including offering competitive pricing, diversifying our customer base, optimizing asset utilization, leveraging the expertise of our various business segments, serving our customers global needs and expanding our support services; impact of losses from conditional obligations arising from guarantees; number of NLE vehicles in inventory over the near term; our belief as to the adequacy of our insurance coverages, funding sources and the effectiveness of our interest and foreign currency exchange rate risk management programs; our relationship with our employees; our belief that we can continue to realize significant savings from our cost management initiatives and process improvement actions, and that such initiatives and actions will mitigate pricing pressures from our SCS customers; estimates of free cash flow, leverage ratios and capital expenditures for 2006; 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the adequacy of our accounting estimates and reserves for pension expense, depreciation and residual value guarantees, self insurance reserves, goodwill impairment, accounting changes and income taxes, and the future impact of FIN 47; our belief that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in their audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period; our ability to fund all of our operations in 2006 through internally generated funds and outside funding sources; and the anticipated impact of fuel prices and cost of environmental liabilities. These statements, as well as other forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report, are based on our current plans and expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We caution readers that certain important factors could cause actual results and events to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward looking statements. For a detailed description of certain of these risk factors, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report. The risks included in this Annual Report are not exhaustive. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors or to assess the impact of such risk factors on our business. As a result, no assurance can be given as to our future results or achievements. You should not place undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report. We do not intend, or assume any obligation, to update or revise any forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required by ITEM 7A is included in ITEM 7 (pages 43 through 44) of PART II of this report. 50 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to improved operating performance and the add back of depreciation expense attributed to VIEs that were consolidated effective July 1, 2003. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Cash used in financing activities decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher debt borrowings and proceeds from stock option exercises were partially offset by increased stock repurchases. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher capital expenditures, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. Cash used in investing activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003 due to higher capital expenditures and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions. Capital expenditures increased in 2004 due to planned higher levels of vehicle replacements for equipment under lease to our customers and new lease sales. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions completed during 2004. We manage our business to maximize operating cash flows and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities as free cash flow. Although free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure, we consider it to be an important measure of comparative operating performance. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 779,062 866,849 803,613 Collections on direct finance leases 70,408 63,795 61,368 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,963 42,839 13,392 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,752 288,674 196,198 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 13,181 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) (734,509 ) Acquisitions (15,110 ) (148,791 ) (96,518 ) Other, net 21,511 6,995 3,723 Free cash flow $ (209,793 ) 146,736 260,448 We used $210 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $147 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) offset by lower acquisition spending. Free cash flow decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher capital spending and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions offset better operating performance, higher proceeds from sales of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions. Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow comparisons in the first half of 2004 were also positively impacted by the add back of depreciation expense of approximately $40 million attributed to VIEs that were consolidated as a result of the adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. We anticipate negative free cash flow levels to improve in 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower income tax payments. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,082,332 862,994 459,239 Commercial rental 251,278 241,858 219,880 1,333,610 1,104,852 679,119 Operating property and equipment 77,360 59,767 46,011 Total capital expenditures 1,410,970 1,164,619 725,130 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (11,591 ) (72,461 ) 9,379 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,399,379 1,092,158 734,509 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $0.4 million, $54 million and $67 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures grew in 2005 and 2004 due primarily to increased replacement activity in our full service lease business. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels should be relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. As a result of our fleet age and anticipated higher levels of new sales and replacement activity, total capital expenditures are anticipated to increase to approximately $1.6 billion in 2006, including lease vehicle replacements of approximately $1.1 billion and spending for anticipated incremental lease growth of approximately $200 million. We expect to fund 2006 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In both 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Ryder completed two acquisitions related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $15 million in 2005, $149 million in 2004 and $97 million in 2003. Approximately $4 million is due to the sellers at December 31, 2005 and will be paid subject to holdback 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) provisions set forth in the purchase agreements. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2006. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 1,783,216 1,815,900 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 188,271 79,033 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 600,000 135,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 162,124 147,153 Retirement of debentures (200,000 ) (72,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (343,933 ) (384,932 ) 406,462 (95,746 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (4,152 ) (9,380 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 433 54,094 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (593 ) 18,348 Total changes in debt 402,150 (32,684 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 32% at December 31, 2005, compared with 37% at December 31, 2004. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2005 Equity 2004 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,185,366 143% $ 1,783,216 118% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 117,062 161,138 Total obligations $ 2,302,428 151% $ 1,944,354 129% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total shareholders equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total shareholders equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess Ryders overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2005 was driven by our increased funding needs as a result of higher vehicle capital spending requirements, higher income tax payments and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A downgrade of Ryders debt rating below investment grade level would limit our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2005 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility is used primarily to finance working capital internationally and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. The credit facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no facility supported letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. During May 2005, the terms of the credit facility were amended thereby extending the expiration of the facility one year to 2010 and reducing the current annual facility fee from 15.0 basis points to 11.0 basis points. The annual facility fee applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2005 was 128%. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, we repaid $200 million of debentures. In September 2005, Ryder filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that were carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. The universal shelf registration statement became effective in November 2005. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) December 31, 2005, Ryder had $800 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder System, Inc., entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is similar to Ryders previous accounts receivable facility, which expired in December 2004, except that this program will be a 364 day facility. This program will be accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which would cause early termination, the program will expire on September 12, 2006, unless extended by the parties. At December 31, 2005, no receivables were sold pursuant to the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2005, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 474 Shelf registration statement 800 Trade receivables facility 200 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans and insurance companies) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be VIEs. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale and operating leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from such sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. These leases contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We did not enter into any sale and operating leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2003. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $16 million and $26 million, respectively, and we have accrued $3 million as a corresponding liability. See Note 17, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2005: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 268,716 438,880 865,837 610,113 2,183,546 Capital lease obligations 722 871 171 56 1,820 Total debt 269,438 439,751 866,008 610,169 2,185,366 Interest on debt(1) 113,332 174,251 120,934 223,016 631,533 Operating leases(2) 102,474 132,255 62,538 66,067 363,334 Purchase obligations(3) 28,794 33,543 8,975 71,312 Total contractual cash obligations 244,600 340,049 192,447 289,083 1,066,179 Insurance obligations(4) 111,163 99,107 40,156 52,814 303,240 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 13,115 1,001 17,104 31,220 Total $ 625,201 892,022 1,099,612 969,170 3,586,005 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2005. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to information technology services. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were derivative contracts, deferred compensation obligations and legal contractual obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2006, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $71 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2006 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $115 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In connection with the accrual of the additional minimum pension liability, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $221 million and $189 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which increased at December 31, 2005 as reductions in discount rates offset the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 7% in 2005. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may, from time to time, make voluntary contributions to our pension plans. During 2005, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $12 million compared with $70 million in 2004. After considering the 2005 contributions, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $115 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. Share Repurchases and Cash Dividends In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. At December 31, 2005, we had repurchased and retired approximately 2.6 million shares under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $109 million. Management has established a prearranged written plan under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allows for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We expect to complete the October 2005 program in the first quarter of 2006. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through employee stock purchase plans since May 1, 2004, which totaled approximately 2.4 million shares at December 31, 2005. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan under Rule 10b5 1 as part of the July 2004 program. In 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate, in part, the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003 up to $90 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the 2003 program. In 2004 and 2003, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million and 117,500 shares, respectively, under the 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million and $3 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $41 million in 2005, $39 million in 2004 and $38 million in 2003. During 2005, we increased our annual dividend to $0.64 per share of common stock. In February 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.16 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2005. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 16, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.5 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement totaled $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% and a fair value of $1.2 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2004 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $13 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements totaled $0.8 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $607 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $285 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2004 totaled $5 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2006 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $10 million and $16 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.1 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $9 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2005, we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004 and $1 million in 2003. We incurred environmental expenses of $9 million, $10 million and $12 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2005 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2005, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2006, which will cause depreciation expense in 2006 to decrease by approximately $13 million compared with 2005. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2006 by approximately $85 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2005, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $5 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2006 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 76% equity securities and 24% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an unrecognized loss of $428 million at the end of 2005 compared with a loss of $371 million at the end of 2004. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2005 results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and assets earning a rate of return below the assumed rates offset in part by the amortization of the opening balance. To the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. The amount of the unrecognized loss subject to amortization in 2006 will be $281 million. The effect on years beyond 2006 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2005 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2006 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2006 Net December 31, 2005 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.90% + 0.25% $5 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.90% 0.25% + $5 million + $41 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $2 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2005, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2006 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2005, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $156 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, in certain instances (typically when we manage transportation for our customers), we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis. In transportation management contracts where we act as an agent, we have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. In addition, we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments. During 2005, we entered into a significant SCS managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as principal in the arrangement. As a result, we recognized an additional $135 million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in 2005 by reporting revenue on a gross basis. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $235 million and $257 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. The amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at December 31, 2004 and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Share Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of SFAS No. 123R would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax benefits and headquarters complex sale. We believe that the comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) offset by lower acquisition spending. Free cash flow decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 as higher capital spending and payments made in connection with FMS acquisitions offset better operating performance, higher proceeds from sales of used vehicles, the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions. Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow comparisons in the first half of 2004 were also positively impacted by the add back of depreciation expense of approximately $40 million attributed to VIEs that were consolidated as a result of the adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. We anticipate negative free cash flow levels to improve in 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower income tax payments. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,082,332 862,994 459,239 Commercial rental 251,278 241,858 219,880 1,333,610 1,104,852 679,119 Operating property and equipment 77,360 59,767 46,011 Total capital expenditures 1,410,970 1,164,619 725,130 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (11,591 ) (72,461 ) 9,379 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,399,379 1,092,158 734,509 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $0.4 million, $54 million and $67 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures grew in 2005 and 2004 due primarily to increased replacement activity in our full service lease business. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels should be relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. As a result of our fleet age and anticipated higher levels of new sales and replacement activity, total capital expenditures are anticipated to increase to approximately $1.6 billion in 2006, including lease vehicle replacements of approximately $1.1 billion and spending for anticipated incremental lease growth of approximately $200 million. We expect to fund 2006 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In both 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Ryder completed two acquisitions related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $15 million in 2005, $149 million in 2004 and $97 million in 2003. Approximately $4 million is due to the sellers at December 31, 2005 and will be paid subject to holdback 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) provisions set forth in the purchase agreements. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2006. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 1,783,216 1,815,900 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 188,271 79,033 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 600,000 135,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 162,124 147,153 Retirement of debentures (200,000 ) (72,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (343,933 ) (384,932 ) 406,462 (95,746 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (4,152 ) (9,380 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 433 54,094 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (593 ) 18,348 Total changes in debt 402,150 (32,684 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 32% at December 31, 2005, compared with 37% at December 31, 2004. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2005 Equity 2004 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,185,366 143% $ 1,783,216 118% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 117,062 161,138 Total obligations $ 2,302,428 151% $ 1,944,354 129% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total shareholders equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total shareholders equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess Ryders overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2005 was driven by our increased funding needs as a result of higher vehicle capital spending requirements, higher income tax payments and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A downgrade of Ryders debt rating below investment grade level would limit our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2005 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility is used primarily to finance working capital internationally and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. The credit facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no facility supported letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. During May 2005, the terms of the credit facility were amended thereby extending the expiration of the facility one year to 2010 and reducing the current annual facility fee from 15.0 basis points to 11.0 basis points. The annual facility fee applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2005 was 128%. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, we repaid $200 million of debentures. In September 2005, Ryder filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that were carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. The universal shelf registration statement became effective in November 2005. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) December 31, 2005, Ryder had $800 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder System, Inc., entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is similar to Ryders previous accounts receivable facility, which expired in December 2004, except that this program will be a 364 day facility. This program will be accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which would cause early termination, the program will expire on September 12, 2006, unless extended by the parties. At December 31, 2005, no receivables were sold pursuant to the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2005, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 474 Shelf registration statement 800 Trade receivables facility 200 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans and insurance companies) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be VIEs. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale and operating leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from such sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. These leases contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We did not enter into any sale and operating leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2003. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $16 million and $26 million, respectively, and we have accrued $3 million as a corresponding liability. See Note 17, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2005: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 268,716 438,880 865,837 610,113 2,183,546 Capital lease obligations 722 871 171 56 1,820 Total debt 269,438 439,751 866,008 610,169 2,185,366 Interest on debt(1) 113,332 174,251 120,934 223,016 631,533 Operating leases(2) 102,474 132,255 62,538 66,067 363,334 Purchase obligations(3) 28,794 33,543 8,975 71,312 Total contractual cash obligations 244,600 340,049 192,447 289,083 1,066,179 Insurance obligations(4) 111,163 99,107 40,156 52,814 303,240 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 13,115 1,001 17,104 31,220 Total $ 625,201 892,022 1,099,612 969,170 3,586,005 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2005. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to information technology services. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were derivative contracts, deferred compensation obligations and legal contractual obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2006, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $71 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2006 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $115 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In connection with the accrual of the additional minimum pension liability, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $221 million and $189 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which increased at December 31, 2005 as reductions in discount rates offset the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 7% in 2005. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may, from time to time, make voluntary contributions to our pension plans. During 2005, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $12 million compared with $70 million in 2004. After considering the 2005 contributions, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $115 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. Share Repurchases and Cash Dividends In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. At December 31, 2005, we had repurchased and retired approximately 2.6 million shares under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $109 million. Management has established a prearranged written plan under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allows for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We expect to complete the October 2005 program in the first quarter of 2006. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through employee stock purchase plans since May 1, 2004, which totaled approximately 2.4 million shares at December 31, 2005. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan under Rule 10b5 1 as part of the July 2004 program. In 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate, in part, the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003 up to $90 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the 2003 program. In 2004 and 2003, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million and 117,500 shares, respectively, under the 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million and $3 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $41 million in 2005, $39 million in 2004 and $38 million in 2003. During 2005, we increased our annual dividend to $0.64 per share of common stock. In February 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.16 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2005. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 16, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.5 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement totaled $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% and a fair value of $1.2 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2004 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $13 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements totaled $0.8 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $607 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $285 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2004 totaled $5 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2006 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $10 million and $16 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.1 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $9 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2005, we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004 and $1 million in 2003. We incurred environmental expenses of $9 million, $10 million and $12 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2005 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2005, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2006, which will cause depreciation expense in 2006 to decrease by approximately $13 million compared with 2005. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2006 by approximately $85 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2005, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $5 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2006 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 76% equity securities and 24% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an unrecognized loss of $428 million at the end of 2005 compared with a loss of $371 million at the end of 2004. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2005 results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and assets earning a rate of return below the assumed rates offset in part by the amortization of the opening balance. To the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. The amount of the unrecognized loss subject to amortization in 2006 will be $281 million. The effect on years beyond 2006 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2005 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2006 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2006 Net December 31, 2005 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.90% + 0.25% $5 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.90% 0.25% + $5 million + $41 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $2 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2005, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2006 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2005, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $156 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, in certain instances (typically when we manage transportation for our customers), we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis. In transportation management contracts where we act as an agent, we have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. In addition, we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments. During 2005, we entered into a significant SCS managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as principal in the arrangement. As a result, we recognized an additional $135 million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in 2005 by reporting revenue on a gross basis. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $235 million and $257 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. The amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at December 31, 2004 and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Share Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of SFAS No. 123R would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax benefits and headquarters complex sale. We believe that the comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) provisions set forth in the purchase agreements. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2006. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2005 2004 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 1,783,216 1,815,900 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 188,271 79,033 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 600,000 135,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 162,124 147,153 Retirement of debentures (200,000 ) (72,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (343,933 ) (384,932 ) 406,462 (95,746 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (4,152 ) (9,380 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 433 54,094 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (593 ) 18,348 Total changes in debt 402,150 (32,684 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 32% at December 31, 2005, compared with 37% at December 31, 2004. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2005 Equity 2004 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,185,366 143% $ 1,783,216 118% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 117,062 161,138 Total obligations $ 2,302,428 151% $ 1,944,354 129% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total shareholders equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total shareholders equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess Ryders overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2005 was driven by our increased funding needs as a result of higher vehicle capital spending requirements, higher income tax payments and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A downgrade of Ryders debt rating below investment grade level would limit our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2005 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility is used primarily to finance working capital internationally and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. The credit facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no facility supported letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. During May 2005, the terms of the credit facility were amended thereby extending the expiration of the facility one year to 2010 and reducing the current annual facility fee from 15.0 basis points to 11.0 basis points. The annual facility fee applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2005 was 128%. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, we repaid $200 million of debentures. In September 2005, Ryder filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that were carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. The universal shelf registration statement became effective in November 2005. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) December 31, 2005, Ryder had $800 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder System, Inc., entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is similar to Ryders previous accounts receivable facility, which expired in December 2004, except that this program will be a 364 day facility. This program will be accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which would cause early termination, the program will expire on September 12, 2006, unless extended by the parties. At December 31, 2005, no receivables were sold pursuant to the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2005, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 474 Shelf registration statement 800 Trade receivables facility 200 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans and insurance companies) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be VIEs. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale and operating leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from such sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. These leases contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We did not enter into any sale and operating leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2003. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $16 million and $26 million, respectively, and we have accrued $3 million as a corresponding liability. See Note 17, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2005: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 268,716 438,880 865,837 610,113 2,183,546 Capital lease obligations 722 871 171 56 1,820 Total debt 269,438 439,751 866,008 610,169 2,185,366 Interest on debt(1) 113,332 174,251 120,934 223,016 631,533 Operating leases(2) 102,474 132,255 62,538 66,067 363,334 Purchase obligations(3) 28,794 33,543 8,975 71,312 Total contractual cash obligations 244,600 340,049 192,447 289,083 1,066,179 Insurance obligations(4) 111,163 99,107 40,156 52,814 303,240 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 13,115 1,001 17,104 31,220 Total $ 625,201 892,022 1,099,612 969,170 3,586,005 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2005. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to information technology services. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were derivative contracts, deferred compensation obligations and legal contractual obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2006, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $71 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2006 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $115 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In connection with the accrual of the additional minimum pension liability, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $221 million and $189 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which increased at December 31, 2005 as reductions in discount rates offset the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 7% in 2005. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may, from time to time, make voluntary contributions to our pension plans. During 2005, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $12 million compared with $70 million in 2004. After considering the 2005 contributions, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $115 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. Share Repurchases and Cash Dividends In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. At December 31, 2005, we had repurchased and retired approximately 2.6 million shares under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $109 million. Management has established a prearranged written plan under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allows for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We expect to complete the October 2005 program in the first quarter of 2006. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through employee stock purchase plans since May 1, 2004, which totaled approximately 2.4 million shares at December 31, 2005. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan under Rule 10b5 1 as part of the July 2004 program. In 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate, in part, the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003 up to $90 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the 2003 program. In 2004 and 2003, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million and 117,500 shares, respectively, under the 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million and $3 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $41 million in 2005, $39 million in 2004 and $38 million in 2003. During 2005, we increased our annual dividend to $0.64 per share of common stock. In February 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.16 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2005. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 16, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.5 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement totaled $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% and a fair value of $1.2 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2004 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $13 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements totaled $0.8 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $607 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $285 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2004 totaled $5 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2006 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $10 million and $16 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.1 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $9 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2005, we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004 and $1 million in 2003. We incurred environmental expenses of $9 million, $10 million and $12 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2005 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2005, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2006, which will cause depreciation expense in 2006 to decrease by approximately $13 million compared with 2005. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2006 by approximately $85 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2005, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $5 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2006 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 76% equity securities and 24% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an unrecognized loss of $428 million at the end of 2005 compared with a loss of $371 million at the end of 2004. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2005 results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and assets earning a rate of return below the assumed rates offset in part by the amortization of the opening balance. To the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. The amount of the unrecognized loss subject to amortization in 2006 will be $281 million. The effect on years beyond 2006 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2005 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2006 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2006 Net December 31, 2005 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.90% + 0.25% $5 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.90% 0.25% + $5 million + $41 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $2 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2005, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2006 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2005, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $156 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, in certain instances (typically when we manage transportation for our customers), we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis. In transportation management contracts where we act as an agent, we have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. In addition, we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments. During 2005, we entered into a significant SCS managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as principal in the arrangement. As a result, we recognized an additional $135 million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in 2005 by reporting revenue on a gross basis. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $235 million and $257 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. The amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at December 31, 2004 and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Share Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of SFAS No. 123R would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax benefits and headquarters complex sale. We believe that the comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Forward looking statements (within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) are statements that relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends concerning matters that are not historical facts.

These statements, as well as other forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report, are based on our current plans and expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We caution readers that certain important factors could cause actual results and events to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward looking statements. For a detailed description of certain of these risk factors, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report. The risks included in this Annual Report are not exhaustive. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors or to assess the impact of such risk factors on our business. As a result, no assurance can be given as to our future results or achievements. You should not place undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report. We do not intend, or assume any obligation, to update or revise any forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total shareholders equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess Ryders overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2005 was driven by our increased funding needs as a result of higher vehicle capital spending requirements, higher income tax payments and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A downgrade of Ryders debt rating below investment grade level would limit our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2005 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility is used primarily to finance working capital internationally and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. The credit facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no facility supported letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. During May 2005, the terms of the credit facility were amended thereby extending the expiration of the facility one year to 2010 and reducing the current annual facility fee from 15.0 basis points to 11.0 basis points. The annual facility fee applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2005 was 128%. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, we repaid $200 million of debentures. In September 2005, Ryder filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that were carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. The universal shelf registration statement became effective in November 2005. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) December 31, 2005, Ryder had $800 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder System, Inc., entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is similar to Ryders previous accounts receivable facility, which expired in December 2004, except that this program will be a 364 day facility. This program will be accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which would cause early termination, the program will expire on September 12, 2006, unless extended by the parties. At December 31, 2005, no receivables were sold pursuant to the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2005, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 474 Shelf registration statement 800 Trade receivables facility 200 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans and insurance companies) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be VIEs. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale and operating leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from such sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. These leases contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We did not enter into any sale and operating leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2003. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $16 million and $26 million, respectively, and we have accrued $3 million as a corresponding liability. See Note 17, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2005: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 268,716 438,880 865,837 610,113 2,183,546 Capital lease obligations 722 871 171 56 1,820 Total debt 269,438 439,751 866,008 610,169 2,185,366 Interest on debt(1) 113,332 174,251 120,934 223,016 631,533 Operating leases(2) 102,474 132,255 62,538 66,067 363,334 Purchase obligations(3) 28,794 33,543 8,975 71,312 Total contractual cash obligations 244,600 340,049 192,447 289,083 1,066,179 Insurance obligations(4) 111,163 99,107 40,156 52,814 303,240 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 13,115 1,001 17,104 31,220 Total $ 625,201 892,022 1,099,612 969,170 3,586,005 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates.

Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to information technology services. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were derivative contracts, deferred compensation obligations and legal contractual obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2006, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $71 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2006 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $115 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In connection with the accrual of the additional minimum pension liability, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $221 million and $189 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which increased at December 31, 2005 as reductions in discount rates offset the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 7% in 2005. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may, from time to time, make voluntary contributions to our pension plans. During 2005, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $12 million compared with $70 million in 2004. After considering the 2005 contributions, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $115 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. Share Repurchases and Cash Dividends In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. At December 31, 2005, we had repurchased and retired approximately 2.6 million shares under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $109 million. Management has established a prearranged written plan under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allows for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We expect to complete the October 2005 program in the first quarter of 2006. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through employee stock purchase plans since May 1, 2004, which totaled approximately 2.4 million shares at December 31, 2005. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan under Rule 10b5 1 as part of the July 2004 program. In 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate, in part, the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003 up to $90 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the 2003 program. In 2004 and 2003, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million and 117,500 shares, respectively, under the 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million and $3 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $41 million in 2005, $39 million in 2004 and $38 million in 2003. During 2005, we increased our annual dividend to $0.64 per share of common stock. In February 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.16 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2005. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 16, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.5 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement totaled $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% and a fair value of $1.2 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2004 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $13 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements totaled $0.8 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $607 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $285 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2004 totaled $5 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2006 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $10 million and $16 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.1 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $9 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2005, we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004 and $1 million in 2003. We incurred environmental expenses of $9 million, $10 million and $12 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2005 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2005, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2006, which will cause depreciation expense in 2006 to decrease by approximately $13 million compared with 2005. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2006 by approximately $85 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2005, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $5 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2006 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 76% equity securities and 24% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an unrecognized loss of $428 million at the end of 2005 compared with a loss of $371 million at the end of 2004. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2005 results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and assets earning a rate of return below the assumed rates offset in part by the amortization of the opening balance. To the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. The amount of the unrecognized loss subject to amortization in 2006 will be $281 million. The effect on years beyond 2006 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2005 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2006 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2006 Net December 31, 2005 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.90% + 0.25% $5 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.90% 0.25% + $5 million + $41 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $2 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2005, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2006 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2005, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $156 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, in certain instances (typically when we manage transportation for our customers), we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis. In transportation management contracts where we act as an agent, we have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. In addition, we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments. During 2005, we entered into a significant SCS managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as principal in the arrangement. As a result, we recognized an additional $135 million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in 2005 by reporting revenue on a gross basis. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $235 million and $257 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. The amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at December 31, 2004 and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Share Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of SFAS No. 123R would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax benefits and headquarters complex sale. We believe that the comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Forward looking statements (within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) are statements that relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends concerning matters that are not historical facts.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) December 31, 2005, Ryder had $800 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder System, Inc., entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is similar to Ryders previous accounts receivable facility, which expired in December 2004, except that this program will be a 364 day facility. This program will be accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which would cause early termination, the program will expire on September 12, 2006, unless extended by the parties. At December 31, 2005, no receivables were sold pursuant to the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2005, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 474 Shelf registration statement 800 Trade receivables facility 200 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans and insurance companies) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be VIEs. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale and operating leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from such sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. These leases contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We did not enter into any sale and operating leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2003. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $16 million and $26 million, respectively, and we have accrued $3 million as a corresponding liability. See Note 17, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2005: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 268,716 438,880 865,837 610,113 2,183,546 Capital lease obligations 722 871 171 56 1,820 Total debt 269,438 439,751 866,008 610,169 2,185,366 Interest on debt(1) 113,332 174,251 120,934 223,016 631,533 Operating leases(2) 102,474 132,255 62,538 66,067 363,334 Purchase obligations(3) 28,794 33,543 8,975 71,312 Total contractual cash obligations 244,600 340,049 192,447 289,083 1,066,179 Insurance obligations(4) 111,163 99,107 40,156 52,814 303,240 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 13,115 1,001 17,104 31,220 Total $ 625,201 892,022 1,099,612 969,170 3,586,005 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2005. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to information technology services. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were derivative contracts, deferred compensation obligations and legal contractual obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2006, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $71 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2006 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $115 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In connection with the accrual of the additional minimum pension liability, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $221 million and $189 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which increased at December 31, 2005 as reductions in discount rates offset the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 7% in 2005. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may, from time to time, make voluntary contributions to our pension plans. During 2005, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $12 million compared with $70 million in 2004. After considering the 2005 contributions, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $115 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. Share Repurchases and Cash Dividends In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. At December 31, 2005, we had repurchased and retired approximately 2.6 million shares under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $109 million. Management has established a prearranged written plan under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allows for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We expect to complete the October 2005 program in the first quarter of 2006. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through employee stock purchase plans since May 1, 2004, which totaled approximately 2.4 million shares at December 31, 2005. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan under Rule 10b5 1 as part of the July 2004 program. In 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate, in part, the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003 up to $90 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the 2003 program. In 2004 and 2003, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million and 117,500 shares, respectively, under the 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million and $3 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $41 million in 2005, $39 million in 2004 and $38 million in 2003. During 2005, we increased our annual dividend to $0.64 per share of common stock. In February 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.16 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2005. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 16, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.5 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement totaled $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% and a fair value of $1.2 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2004 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $13 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements totaled $0.8 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $607 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $285 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2004 totaled $5 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2006 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $10 million and $16 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.1 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $9 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2005, we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004 and $1 million in 2003. We incurred environmental expenses of $9 million, $10 million and $12 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2005 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2005, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2006, which will cause depreciation expense in 2006 to decrease by approximately $13 million compared with 2005. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2006 by approximately $85 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2005, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $5 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2006 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 76% equity securities and 24% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an unrecognized loss of $428 million at the end of 2005 compared with a loss of $371 million at the end of 2004. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2005 results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and assets earning a rate of return below the assumed rates offset in part by the amortization of the opening balance. To the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. The amount of the unrecognized loss subject to amortization in 2006 will be $281 million. The effect on years beyond 2006 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2005 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2006 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2006 Net December 31, 2005 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.90% + 0.25% $5 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.90% 0.25% + $5 million + $41 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $2 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2005, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2006 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2005, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $156 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, in certain instances (typically when we manage transportation for our customers), we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis. In transportation management contracts where we act as an agent, we have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. In addition, we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments. During 2005, we entered into a significant SCS managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as principal in the arrangement. As a result, we recognized an additional $135 million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in 2005 by reporting revenue on a gross basis. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $235 million and $257 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. The amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at December 31, 2004 and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Share Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of SFAS No. 123R would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax benefits and headquarters complex sale. We believe that the comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Forward looking statements (within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) are statements that relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends concerning matters that are not historical facts. These statements are often preceded by or include the words believe, expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, will, may, could, should or similar expressions. This Annual Report contains forward looking statements including, but not limited to, statements regarding: our expectations as to anticipated revenue and earnings growth across all business segments; our ability to improve our competitive advantage by leveraging our vehicle buying power, reducing vehicle downtime, providing innovative broad based supply chain solutions and increasing our customers competitive positions; anticipated gains on the sale of used vehicles; the impact of the restructuring activities and growth initiatives on our FMS business segment; our ability to successfully achieve the operational goals that are the basis of our business strategies, including offering competitive pricing, diversifying our customer base, optimizing asset utilization, leveraging the expertise of our various business segments, serving our customers global needs and expanding our support services; impact of losses from conditional obligations arising from guarantees; number of NLE vehicles in inventory over the near term; our belief as to the adequacy of our insurance coverages, funding sources and the effectiveness of our interest and foreign currency exchange rate risk management programs; our relationship with our employees; our belief that we can continue to realize significant savings from our cost management initiatives and process improvement actions, and that such initiatives and actions will mitigate pricing pressures from our SCS customers; estimates of free cash flow, leverage ratios and capital expenditures for 2006; 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These statements, as well as other forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report, are based on our current plans and expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We caution readers that certain important factors could cause actual results and events to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward looking statements. For a detailed description of certain of these risk factors, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report. The risks included in this Annual Report are not exhaustive. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors or to assess the impact of such risk factors on our business. As a result, no assurance can be given as to our future results or achievements. You should not place undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report. We do not intend, or assume any obligation, to update or revise any forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $16 million and $26 million, respectively, and we have accrued $3 million as a corresponding liability. See Note 17, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2005: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 268,716 438,880 865,837 610,113 2,183,546 Capital lease obligations 722 871 171 56 1,820 Total debt 269,438 439,751 866,008 610,169 2,185,366 Interest on debt(1) 113,332 174,251 120,934 223,016 631,533 Operating leases(2) 102,474 132,255 62,538 66,067 363,334 Purchase obligations(3) 28,794 33,543 8,975 71,312 Total contractual cash obligations 244,600 340,049 192,447 289,083 1,066,179 Insurance obligations(4) 111,163 99,107 40,156 52,814 303,240 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 13,115 1,001 17,104 31,220 Total $ 625,201 892,022 1,099,612 969,170 3,586,005 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2005. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to information technology services. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were derivative contracts, deferred compensation obligations and legal contractual obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2006, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $71 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2006 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $115 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In connection with the accrual of the additional minimum pension liability, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $221 million and $189 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which increased at December 31, 2005 as reductions in discount rates offset the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 7% in 2005. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may, from time to time, make voluntary contributions to our pension plans. During 2005, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $12 million compared with $70 million in 2004. After considering the 2005 contributions, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $115 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. Share Repurchases and Cash Dividends In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. At December 31, 2005, we had repurchased and retired approximately 2.6 million shares under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $109 million. Management has established a prearranged written plan under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allows for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We expect to complete the October 2005 program in the first quarter of 2006. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through employee stock purchase plans since May 1, 2004, which totaled approximately 2.4 million shares at December 31, 2005. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan under Rule 10b5 1 as part of the July 2004 program. In 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate, in part, the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003 up to $90 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the 2003 program. In 2004 and 2003, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million and 117,500 shares, respectively, under the 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million and $3 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $41 million in 2005, $39 million in 2004 and $38 million in 2003. During 2005, we increased our annual dividend to $0.64 per share of common stock. In February 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.16 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2005. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 16, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.5 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement totaled $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% and a fair value of $1.2 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2004 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $13 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements totaled $0.8 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $607 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $285 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2004 totaled $5 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2006 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $10 million and $16 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.1 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $9 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2005, we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004 and $1 million in 2003. We incurred environmental expenses of $9 million, $10 million and $12 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2005 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2005, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2006, which will cause depreciation expense in 2006 to decrease by approximately $13 million compared with 2005. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2006 by approximately $85 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2005, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $5 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2006 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 76% equity securities and 24% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an unrecognized loss of $428 million at the end of 2005 compared with a loss of $371 million at the end of 2004. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2005 results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and assets earning a rate of return below the assumed rates offset in part by the amortization of the opening balance. To the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. The amount of the unrecognized loss subject to amortization in 2006 will be $281 million. The effect on years beyond 2006 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2005 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2006 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2006 Net December 31, 2005 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.90% + 0.25% $5 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.90% 0.25% + $5 million + $41 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $2 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2005, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2006 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2005, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $156 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, in certain instances (typically when we manage transportation for our customers), we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis. In transportation management contracts where we act as an agent, we have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. In addition, we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments. During 2005, we entered into a significant SCS managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as principal in the arrangement. As a result, we recognized an additional $135 million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in 2005 by reporting revenue on a gross basis. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $235 million and $257 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. The amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at December 31, 2004 and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Share Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of SFAS No. 123R would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax benefits and headquarters complex sale. We believe that the comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required by ITEM 7A is included in ITEM 7 (pages 43 through 44) of PART II of this report. 50 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In connection with the accrual of the additional minimum pension liability, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $221 million and $189 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which increased at December 31, 2005 as reductions in discount rates offset the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 7% in 2005. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may, from time to time, make voluntary contributions to our pension plans. During 2005, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $12 million compared with $70 million in 2004. After considering the 2005 contributions, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $115 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. Share Repurchases and Cash Dividends In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. At December 31, 2005, we had repurchased and retired approximately 2.6 million shares under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $109 million. Management has established a prearranged written plan under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allows for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We expect to complete the October 2005 program in the first quarter of 2006. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through employee stock purchase plans since May 1, 2004, which totaled approximately 2.4 million shares at December 31, 2005. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan under Rule 10b5 1 as part of the July 2004 program. In 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate, in part, the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003 up to $90 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the 2003 program. In 2004 and 2003, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million and 117,500 shares, respectively, under the 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million and $3 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $41 million in 2005, $39 million in 2004 and $38 million in 2003. During 2005, we increased our annual dividend to $0.64 per share of common stock. In February 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.16 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2005. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 16, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.5 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement totaled $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% and a fair value of $1.2 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2004 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $13 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements totaled $0.8 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $607 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $285 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2004 totaled $5 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2006 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $10 million and $16 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.1 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $9 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2005, we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004 and $1 million in 2003. We incurred environmental expenses of $9 million, $10 million and $12 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2005 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2005, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2006, which will cause depreciation expense in 2006 to decrease by approximately $13 million compared with 2005. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2006 by approximately $85 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2005, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $5 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2006 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 76% equity securities and 24% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an unrecognized loss of $428 million at the end of 2005 compared with a loss of $371 million at the end of 2004. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2005 results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and assets earning a rate of return below the assumed rates offset in part by the amortization of the opening balance. To the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. The amount of the unrecognized loss subject to amortization in 2006 will be $281 million. The effect on years beyond 2006 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2005 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2006 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2006 Net December 31, 2005 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.90% + 0.25% $5 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.90% 0.25% + $5 million + $41 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $2 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2005, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2006 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2005, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $156 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, in certain instances (typically when we manage transportation for our customers), we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis. In transportation management contracts where we act as an agent, we have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. In addition, we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments. During 2005, we entered into a significant SCS managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as principal in the arrangement. As a result, we recognized an additional $135 million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in 2005 by reporting revenue on a gross basis. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $235 million and $257 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. The amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at December 31, 2004 and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Share Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of SFAS No. 123R would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax benefits and headquarters complex sale. We believe that the comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.16 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2005. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 16, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.5 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement totaled $0.2 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% and a fair value of $1.2 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2004 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $13 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements totaled $0.8 million. At December 31, 2004, we had $607 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $285 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2004 totaled $5 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2006 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $10 million and $16 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.1 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $9 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2005, we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004 and $1 million in 2003. We incurred environmental expenses of $9 million, $10 million and $12 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2005 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2005, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2006, which will cause depreciation expense in 2006 to decrease by approximately $13 million compared with 2005. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2006 by approximately $85 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2005, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $5 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2006 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 76% equity securities and 24% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an unrecognized loss of $428 million at the end of 2005 compared with a loss of $371 million at the end of 2004. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2005 results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and assets earning a rate of return below the assumed rates offset in part by the amortization of the opening balance. To the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. The amount of the unrecognized loss subject to amortization in 2006 will be $281 million. The effect on years beyond 2006 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2005 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2006 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2006 Net December 31, 2005 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.90% + 0.25% $5 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.90% 0.25% + $5 million + $41 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $2 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2005, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2006 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2005, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $156 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, in certain instances (typically when we manage transportation for our customers), we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis. In transportation management contracts where we act as an agent, we have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. In addition, we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments. During 2005, we entered into a significant SCS managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as principal in the arrangement. As a result, we recognized an additional $135 million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in 2005 by reporting revenue on a gross basis. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $235 million and $257 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. The amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at December 31, 2004 and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Share Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of SFAS No. 123R would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax benefits and headquarters complex sale. We believe that the comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Forward looking statements (within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) are statements that relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends concerning matters that are not historical facts. These statements are often preceded by or include the words believe, expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, will, may, could, should or similar expressions. This Annual Report contains forward looking statements including, but not limited to, statements regarding: our expectations as to anticipated revenue and earnings growth across all business segments; our ability to improve our competitive advantage by leveraging our vehicle buying power, reducing vehicle downtime, providing innovative broad based supply chain solutions and increasing our customers competitive positions; anticipated gains on the sale of used vehicles; the impact of the restructuring activities and growth initiatives on our FMS business segment; our ability to successfully achieve the operational goals that are the basis of our business strategies, including offering competitive pricing, diversifying our customer base, optimizing asset utilization, leveraging the expertise of our various business segments, serving our customers global needs and expanding our support services; impact of losses from conditional obligations arising from guarantees; number of NLE vehicles in inventory over the near term; our belief as to the adequacy of our insurance coverages, funding sources and the effectiveness of our interest and foreign currency exchange rate risk management programs; our relationship with our employees; our belief that we can continue to realize significant savings from our cost management initiatives and process improvement actions, and that such initiatives and actions will mitigate pricing pressures from our SCS customers; estimates of free cash flow, leverage ratios and capital expenditures for 2006; 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These statements, as well as other forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report, are based on our current plans and expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We caution readers that certain important factors could cause actual results and events to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward looking statements. For a detailed description of certain of these risk factors, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report. The risks included in this Annual Report are not exhaustive. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors or to assess the impact of such risk factors on our business. As a result, no assurance can be given as to our future results or achievements. You should not place undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report. We do not intend, or assume any obligation, to update or revise any forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $10 million and $16 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.1 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $9 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2005, we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004 and $1 million in 2003. We incurred environmental expenses of $9 million, $10 million and $12 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2005 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2005, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2006, which will cause depreciation expense in 2006 to decrease by approximately $13 million compared with 2005. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2006 by approximately $85 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2005, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $5 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2006 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 76% equity securities and 24% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an unrecognized loss of $428 million at the end of 2005 compared with a loss of $371 million at the end of 2004. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2005 results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and assets earning a rate of return below the assumed rates offset in part by the amortization of the opening balance. To the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. The amount of the unrecognized loss subject to amortization in 2006 will be $281 million. The effect on years beyond 2006 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2005 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2006 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2006 Net December 31, 2005 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.90% + 0.25% $5 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.90% 0.25% + $5 million + $41 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $2 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2005, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2006 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2005, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $156 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, in certain instances (typically when we manage transportation for our customers), we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis. In transportation management contracts where we act as an agent, we have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. In addition, we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments. During 2005, we entered into a significant SCS managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as principal in the arrangement. As a result, we recognized an additional $135 million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in 2005 by reporting revenue on a gross basis. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $235 million and $257 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. The amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at December 31, 2004 and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Share Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of SFAS No. 123R would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax benefits and headquarters complex sale. We believe that the comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2005, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2006, which will cause depreciation expense in 2006 to decrease by approximately $13 million compared with 2005. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2006 by approximately $85 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2005, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $5 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2005, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2006 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 76% equity securities and 24% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted. Although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements, disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an unrecognized loss of $428 million at the end of 2005 compared with a loss of $371 million at the end of 2004. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2005 results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and assets earning a rate of return below the assumed rates offset in part by the amortization of the opening balance. To the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. The amount of the unrecognized loss subject to amortization in 2006 will be $281 million. The effect on years beyond 2006 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2005 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2006 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2006 Net December 31, 2005 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.90% + 0.25% $5 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.90% 0.25% + $5 million + $41 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $2 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $2 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2005, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2006 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2005, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $156 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, in certain instances (typically when we manage transportation for our customers), we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis. In transportation management contracts where we act as an agent, we have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. In addition, we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments. During 2005, we entered into a significant SCS managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as principal in the arrangement. As a result, we recognized an additional $135 million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in 2005 by reporting revenue on a gross basis. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $235 million and $257 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. The amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at December 31, 2004 and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Share Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of SFAS No. 123R would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax benefits and headquarters complex sale. We believe that the comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2005, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $156 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, in certain instances (typically when we manage transportation for our customers), we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis. In transportation management contracts where we act as an agent, we have complete discretion in selecting the means, route and procedures to be followed in the handling, transportation and delivery of freight. In addition, we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments. During 2005, we entered into a significant SCS managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as principal in the arrangement. As a result, we recognized an additional $135 million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in 2005 by reporting revenue on a gross basis. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $235 million and $257 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment was $12 million. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. The amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at December 31, 2004 and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Share Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of SFAS No. 123R would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules.

We believe that the comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
