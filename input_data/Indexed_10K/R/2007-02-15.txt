ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8 of this report on Form 10 K. The following MD&A describes the principal factors affecting results of operations, financial resources, liquidity, contractual cash obligations, and critical accounting estimates. OVERVIEW Ryder System, Inc. (Ryder), is a global leader in transportation and supply chain management solutions. Our business is divided into three business segments, which operate in extremely competitive markets. Our customers select us based on numerous factors including service quality, price, technology and service offerings. As an alternative to using our services, customers may choose to provide these services for themselves, or may choose to obtain similar or alternative services from other third party vendors. Our customer base includes enterprises operating in a variety of industries including automotive, electronics, high tech, telecommunications, industrial, consumer goods, paper and paper products, office equipment, food and beverage, general retail industries and governments. The Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment is our largest segment providing full service leasing, contract maintenance, contract related maintenance, and commercial rental of trucks, tractors and trailers to customers principally in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. FMS revenue and assets in 2006 were $3.71 billion and $6.12 billion, respectively, representing 59% of our consolidated revenue and 90% of consolidated assets. The Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) business segment provides comprehensive supply chain consulting including distribution and transportation services throughout North America and in Latin America, Europe and Asia. SCS revenue in 2006 was $2.03 billion, representing 32% of our consolidated revenue. The Dedicated Contract Carriage (DCC) business segment provides vehicles and drivers as part of a dedicated transportation solution in the U.S. DCC revenue in 2006 was $569 million, representing 9% of our consolidated revenue. 2006 was a year of significant accomplishments for Ryder, as we realized record earnings for the third consecutive year. Continued development of our sales and operating capabilities in each of our business segments, continued focus on financial discipline and cost management while investing for strategic growth, provided support for earnings expansion. Total revenue was $6.31 billion, up 10% from $5.74 billion in 2005, while our operating revenue (total revenue less fuel and subcontracted transportation) measure was up $243 million or 6%. All business segments contributed to the total revenue growth. The growth in FMS revenue was driven in part by increased fuel services revenue, primarily as a result of higher average fuel prices, as well as higher full service lease revenue resulting from higher lease rates and business expansion. The growth in SCS revenue was driven primarily by higher volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups. The growth in DCC revenue was driven by expanded and new business as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. Comparisons for 2006 were also impacted by favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates of 0.8% related to our international operations. Earnings from continuing operations grew to $249 million from $228 million in 2005 and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations increased to $4.04 from $3.53 in 2005. Included in earnings from continuing operations are certain items we do not consider indicative of our ongoing 21 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operations. The following discussion provides a summary of the 2006 and 2005 special items which are discussed in more detail throughout our MD&A: 2006 Earnings for 2006 included an income tax benefit of $7 million, or $0.11 per diluted common share, associated with the reduction of deferred income taxes due to enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws. Earnings for 2006 included a one time, non cash pension accounting charge of $4 million after tax, or $0.06 per diluted common share, to properly account for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements made in 1995 and 2000. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 2005 Earnings for 2005 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share, related to a change in Ohio income tax law. Net earnings for 2005 included (i) income from discontinued operations associated with the reduction of insurance reserves related to discontinued operations resulting in an after tax benefit of $2 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, and (ii) the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for costs associated with the future removal of underground storage tanks resulting in an after tax charge of $2 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share. Excluding the special items listed above, comparable earnings from continuing operations were $246 million, up 12% from $220 million in 2005. Comparable earnings from continuing operations per diluted common share were $3.99, up 17% from $3.41 in 2005. All business segments contributed to the strong results. The earnings growth was driven primarily by contractual revenue growth from each of our business segments, which more than offset the impact of a soft commercial rental market in FMS for the second half of 2006. The results of ongoing cost management initiatives across all business segments and in our central support functions also contributed to the earnings growth in 2006. Earnings per common share growth during 2006 exceeded the earnings growth over the prior periods because the average number of shares outstanding has decreased during the past year reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. With the continuing improvements in earnings over the past three years, we were able to repurchase a total of 3.4 million shares of common stock in 2006 for $159 million. We also increased our annual dividend by 13% to $0.72 per share of common stock. In addition, during 2006 we contributed $130 million to our global pension plans. Capital expenditures increased to $1.76 billion compared with $1.41 billion in 2005. The increase in capital expenditures reflects higher lease vehicle spending for replacements and expansion of customer fleets. The significant amount of capital spending to support contractual revenue growth, as well as pension contributions and share repurchases contributed to the increase in our debt from $2.19 billion at December 31, 2005 to $2.82 billion at December 31, 2006. Our debt to equity ratio also increased to 164% from 143% in 2005. Total obligations (including off balance sheet debt) to equity ratio increased to 168% from 151% in 2005. 2007 Outlook Our outlook for 2007 is positive, despite the uncertainty of our FMS commercial rental business. We expect stable economic conditions in 2007. Our efforts will focus on the implementation of our contractual revenue growth strategies across all business segments while retaining financial discipline. Total revenue is targeted to grow by 5% to 7% while operating revenue is expected to increase by 4% to 5%. We will also 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) continue to focus on cost management and process improvement actions that complement our growth strategies and establish a foundation for sustainable long term profitable growth. As a result, we expect earnings from continuing operations per diluted common share in 2007 to grow by 8% to 10% compared to 2006 comparable earnings from continuing operations per diluted common share. ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY BETWEEN PERIODS Accounting Changes Effective December 31, 2006, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as a liability and record the unrecognized net actuarial loss, unrecognized prior service cost and unrecognized transition asset of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as a component of other comprehensive income. The adoption of this standard reduced total assets by $155 million, total liabilities by $4 million and shareholders equity by $151 million, with no impact to our consolidated statements of earnings and cash flows. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payments. Under SFAS No. 123R, compensation expense was recognized beginning January 1, 2006 and included (a) compensation expense for all share based employee compensation arrangements granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and (b) compensation expense for all share based employee compensation arrangements granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. Results for prior periods have not been restated. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006, earnings before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $10 million ($7 million after tax) lower, than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Both basic and diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $0.12 lower than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under APB No. 25. At December 31, 2006, unrecognized compensation expense from stock options and nonvested shares totaled $20 million, which is expected to be recognized over the next 3.5 years. Effective December 31, 2005, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. The adoption of FIN 47 required us to record an asset retirement obligation related to the future removal of underground storage tanks located at our FMS maintenance facilities. We recognized a cumulative effect charge upon adoption of $2 million on an after tax basis, or $0.04 per diluted common share. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our operating results. Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. FMS Acquisition On March 1, 2004, we completed an asset purchase agreement with Ruan Leasing Company (Ruan) under which we acquired Ruans fleet of approximately 6,400 vehicles, 37 of its 111 service locations and more than 500 customers. Ryder also acquired full service contract maintenance agreements covering approximately 1,700 vehicles. The network operates under Ryders name and has allowed us to leverage our existing U.S. infrastructure in key markets while adding new infrastructure to strengthen our presence in targeted areas of the Midwest, Southeast, Mid Atlantic and Southwest. The results of this acquisition have been included in the consolidated results of Ryder since the date of acquisition. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. (2) Results included restructuring and other charges (recoveries), net of $2 million after tax, or $0.04 per diluted common share, in 2006, $2 million after tax, or $0.03 per diluted common share, in 2005 and $(11) million after tax, or $(0.17) per diluted common share, in 2004. See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges (Recoveries), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. 2006 also included an after tax charge of $4 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, related to the accounting for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements in 1995 and 2000. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. (3) Net earnings for 2005 included (i) income from discontinued operations associated with the reduction of insurance reserves related to discontinued operations resulting in an after tax benefit of $2 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, and (ii) the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for costs associated with the future removal of underground storage tanks resulting in an after tax charge of $2 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased to $393 million in 2006 compared with $357 million in 2005, reflecting better operating performance in all business segments. The 2006 operating performance improvement was driven by contractual revenue growth in each of our business segments, which more than offset the impact of a soft commercial rental market on our FMS business segment results in the second half of 2006. See Operating Results by Business Segment for a further discussion of operating results. Earnings from continuing operations increased to $249 million in 2006 compared with $228 million in 2005. Earnings from continuing operations for 2006 included an income tax benefit of $7 million, or $0.11 per diluted common share, associated with the reduction of deferred income taxes due to enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws and a one time, non cash after tax charge of $4 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, recorded to properly account for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements made in 1995 and 2000. Earnings from continuing operations for 2005 included a state income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share, associated with the reduction of deferred income taxes due to the expected phase out of income taxes for the State of Ohio. Earnings per common share growth during 2006 exceeded the net earnings growth over the prior periods because the average number of shares outstanding has decreased during the past year reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased to $357 million in 2005 compared with $331 million in 2004, reflecting better operating performance in all business segments. Strong FMS commercial rental results, higher gains on FMS used vehicle sales and reductions in operating expenses resulting from ongoing cost reduction activities and process improvement actions across all business segments, were partially offset by the benefit from gains on the 2004 sale of our headquarters complex. Earnings from continuing operations increased to $228 million in 2005 compared with $216 million in 2004. Earnings from continuing operations in 2005 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share, related to a change in Ohio income tax law. Earnings from continuing operations in 2004 benefited from after tax gains on the sale of our headquarters complex of $15 million, or $0.23 per diluted common share, and a net income tax benefit of $9 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share, associated with the resolution of various tax matters. Net earnings in 2005 included an after tax benefit of $2 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, related to discontinued operations and an after tax charge of $2 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share, for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the adoption of FIN 47. Change Years ended December 31 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Revenue: Fleet Management Solutions $ 4,096,046 3,921,191 3,602,839 4 % 9 Supply Chain Solutions 2,028,489 1,637,826 1,354,003 24 21 Dedicated Contract Carriage 568,842 543,268 506,100 5 7 Eliminations (386,734 ) (361,438 ) (312,664 ) (7 ) (16 ) Total $ 6,306,643 5,740,847 5,150,278 10 % 11 Operating revenue(1) $ 4,454,231 4,210,881 4,041,898 6 % 4 (1) We use operating revenue, a non GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of our businesses and as a measure of sales activity. FMS fuel services revenue net of related intersegment billings, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from the operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation revenue in our SCS and DCC business segments is excluded from the operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to our customers and we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Refer to the section titled Non GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of operating revenue to total revenue. All business segments reported revenue growth in 2006. Revenue growth for FMS was driven by higher fuel services revenue, primarily as a result of higher average fuel prices from increased fuel costs, and higher full service lease revenue resulting from higher lease rates and new contract sales. SCS revenue growth was due primarily to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation and higher volumes and new and expanded business. DCC revenue growth was due to expanded and new business as well as pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. Revenue comparisons were also impacted by favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.8% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real. All business segments reported revenue growth in 2005. Additionally, revenue comparisons for all business segments were favorably impacted by pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs which 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) increased fuel services revenue. FMS revenue was also positively impacted by higher rental revenue resulting from stronger pricing and increased contract related maintenance revenue from the implementation of growth initiatives. SCS revenue growth was primarily related to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. In addition, SCS and DCC revenue grew in 2005 due to new and expanded business. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.9% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. The increases in eliminations in 2006 and 2005, primarily reflects the pass through of higher average fuel costs from the FMS segment to SCS and DCC. Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Operating expense (exclusive of items shown separately) $2,722,592 2,572,241 2,305,322 6% 12 Percentage of revenue 43% 45% 45% Operating expense grew for 2006 and 2005 principally as a result of higher fuel costs due to higher average market prices. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. The revenue growth from each business segment, excluding fuel, also contributed to the increases in operating expenses. Change Years ended December 31 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $1,397,391 1,262,160 1,233,038 11% 2 Percentage of revenue 22% 22% 24% Percentage of operating revenue 31% 30% 31% Salaries and employee related costs and salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue increased in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily as a result of added headcount and increased outside labor costs to support the growth in our SCS and DCC business segments, higher share based compensation and higher employee benefit expenses. Average headcount increased 4% in 2006 compared with 2005. The number of employees at December 31, 2006 increased to approximately 28,600, compared with 27,800 in 2005, due primarily to the growth in our SCS business segment. Additionally, on January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R and recognized $10 million of additional share based compensation expense in 2006. See Note 22, Share Based Compensation Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense increased $11 million in 2006 to $70 million compared with 2005. During 2006, we recorded a one time, non cash charge of $6 million ($4 million after tax), to properly account for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements made in 1995 and 2000. The impact of this one time charge was partially offset by a reduction of our 2006 fourth quarter pension expense of $5 million ($3 million after tax) resulting from the interim remeasurement of plan assets and pension obligations. The 2006 pension accounting charge and the benefit attributed to the interim pension remeasurement discussed above were excluded from our segment measure of financial performance. All other increases to pension expense largely impacted our FMS business segment which employs the majority of our employees that participate in the primary U.S. pension plan. See Note 23, Employee 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding these items. Based on actual pension asset returns experienced in 2006, 2006 contributions and interest rate levels at December 31, 2006, we expect pension expense on a pre tax basis to decrease approximately $31 million in 2007, excluding the impact of the $6 million pension accounting charge recorded in 2006. Our 2007 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. Our 2007 interest expense on borrowings will also increase by $5 million because of pension contributions made in the current year. The anticipated decrease in pension expense, net of higher interest on borrowings, would primarily impact our FMS business segment. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Salaries and employee related costs grew for 2005 compared with 2004 as a result of headcount added to support the growth in our SCS business segment, which was offset slightly by reduced performance based incentive compensation and lower employee benefit costs. Average headcount increased 2% in 2005 compared with 2004. Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $865,475 638,319 424,991 36% 50 Percentage of revenue 14% 11% 8% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. During 2006 and 2005, subcontracted transportation expense in our SCS business segment grew due to increased volumes of freight management activity from new and expanded business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs, resulting from increased fuel costs. Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $ 743,288 740,415 706,028 % 5 Gains on vehicle sales, net (50,766 ) (47,098 ) (34,504 ) 8 37 Equipment rental 103,297 102,816 108,468 (5 ) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased slightly in 2006 compared with 2005, reflecting the impact of a higher average vehicle investment on purchases over the past year. These changes were partially offset by the impact of a lower average fleet count and the adjustments made to residual values and useful lives as part of the annual depreciation review, which were implemented January 1, 2006. The growth in depreciation expense during 2005 compared to 2004 was due to higher vehicle replacement activity within our truck and tractor fleets as well as the conversion of leased vehicles to owned status, partially offset by a decline in our average trailer fleet size. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased in 2006 compared with 2005 due to improved average pricing on vehicles sold, which more than offset the decline in the number of vehicles sold. The improvement in gains on vehicle sales, net in 2005 compared with 2004 was due to an increase in the number of units sold combined with improved average pricing. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease. The increase in equipment rental in 2006 compared with 2005 reflects the impact of higher rental costs associated with investments made in material handling equipment to support the growth in our SCS business, which more than offset the decline in vehicle related rental expense from a smaller average lease count. The decrease in equipment rental in 2005 compared to 2004 was due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles. Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $ 140,561 120,474 100,114 17% 20 Effective interest rate 5.7% 5.6% 5.5% Interest expense grew in 2006 compared with 2005, reflecting higher average debt levels due to funding requirements associated with higher capital spending to support our contractual full service lease business, the funding of global pension contributions and share repurchases. Interest expense grew in 2005 reflecting higher average debt levels, resulting from increased capital spending, income tax payments and share repurchases. Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Miscellaneous income, net $ (11,732 ) (8,944 ) (6,625 ) 31% 35 Miscellaneous income, net consists of investment income on securities used to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, (gains) losses from sales of properties, foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, and other non operating items. Miscellaneous income, net increased in 2006 compared with 2005 due to a 2006 fourth quarter business interruption insurance claim recovery from hurricane related losses of $3 million ($2 million within our FMS business segment and $1 million within our DCC business segment), a one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies and better market performance of investments classified as trading securities. These favorable comparisons were partially offset by a $1 million charge in 2006 related to the settlement of litigation associated with a discontinued operation, as well as the one time recovery in the first quarter of 2005 of $3 million of project costs incurred in prior years. Miscellaneous income, net increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to the previously mentioned one time recovery for project costs incurred in prior years and better market performance of investments classified as trading securities. Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges (recoveries), net $ 3,564 3,376 (17,676 ) 2006 Activity During 2006, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other charges of $4 million that primarily consisted of early debt retirement costs and employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) These charges were partially offset by adjustments to prior year severance and employee related accruals and facility charges. We expect to realize annual pre tax cost savings of approximately $8 million from the 2006 fourth quarter measures once all employee severance actions have been completed. As part of ongoing cost management actions, Ryder incurred $2 million in costs in the fourth quarter to extinguish high interest paying debentures that were originally set to mature in 2016. The total debt retirement costs consisted of the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of the related debt discount and issuance costs. We expect to realize annual pre tax interest savings over the next 4 years of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of this debenture. In the fourth quarter, Ryder also approved a plan to eliminate approximately 150 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions throughout Ryders domestic and international business segments and Central Support Services (CSS). The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million. Although some of these actions were completed as of December 31, 2006, transition plans for eliminating some of the positions will be communicated in the beginning of 2007. Cost reductions associated with the actions that have been completed as of December 31, 2006 will benefit salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2007. Cost reductions associated with the elimination of the other positions will benefit salaries and employee related costs in the latter part of 2007. During 2006 we also had employee related accruals and facility charges recorded in prior restructuring charges that were adjusted due to subsequent refinements in estimates. 2005 Activity During 2005, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other charges of $3 million that consisted of employee severance and benefits, contract termination costs, and closure of leased facilities partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter and related primarily to the restructuring of our U.K. operations, and the offshoring of some administrative finance and support functions that will allow for future cost savings. By December 31, 2006, the 2005 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs in the latter half of 2006. During 2005, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 160 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in Ryders domestic and international FMS and SCS business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $3 million. Cost reductions associated with these actions benefited salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Many of the eliminated positions in our domestic operations were impacted by the decision to outsource certain administrative finance functions to lower cost foreign providers and maximize our technology resources. Transition actions began in February 2006 and continued through the remainder of 2006. We also closed two administrative offices in the U.S. as a result of the restructuring of our FMS domestic business operations and recorded a charge for future cash payments related to lease obligations. Also in 2005, management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced telecommunication services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the outsourcing agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 2010. In accordance with the terms of this service agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling nearly $1 million for contract termination costs. In 2006, the transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses in the latter part of 2006. These charges were partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals due to refinements in estimates. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2004 Activity During 2004, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other recoveries of $18 million that consisted of gains from the sale of the previous headquarters complex and reversals of severance and employee related accruals partially offset by contract termination costs. During 2004, we recognized $24 million in gains from properties sold in connection with the relocation of our headquarters. In May 2004, we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters facility for $39 million in cash and recognized a $22 million gain from the sale. In conjunction with this sale, we entered into a lease agreement with the purchaser to lease back the headquarters facility until we relocated to our new headquarters in April 2005. Also during 2004, we recognized gains totaling $2 million from the sale of properties ancillary to our main headquarters facility. In 2004, as part of ongoing cost containment initiatives, Ryder management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced information technology infrastructure services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the outsourcing agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 2010. In accordance with the terms of the services agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling $8 million for contract termination ($6 million) and transition costs incurred since termination ($2 million). By December 31, 2004, all transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses starting in 2005.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As part of managements evaluation of segment operating performance, we define the primary measurement of our segment financial performance as Net Before Tax (NBT), which includes an allocation of CSS and excludes restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net and 2006 net retirement plan charges. The following table provides a reconciliation of items excluded from our segment NBT measure to their classification within our Consolidated Statements of Earnings: Consolidated Years ended December 31 Statements of Earnings Description Line Item(1) 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Severance and employee related (costs) recoveries Restructuring $ (1,048 ) (2,449 ) 1,216 Facilities and related (costs) recoveries Restructuring (194 ) (181 ) 79 Early retirement of debt Restructuring (2,141 ) Contract termination and transition costs Restructuring (181 ) (746 ) (8,000 ) Gain on sale of headquarter complex Restructuring 24,308 Other Restructuring 73 Restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net (3,564 ) (3,376 ) 17,676 Pension accounting charge(2) Salaries (5,872 ) Pension remeasurement benefit(2) Salaries 4,667 Postretirement benefit plan charge(2) Salaries (1,842 ) 2006 net retirement plan (charges) (3,047 ) Restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net and 2006 net retirement plan charges $ (6,611 ) (3,376 ) 17,676 (1) Restructuring refers to the Restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net and Salaries refers to Salaries and employee related costs on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. (2) See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all of our business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each of our business segments and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, corporate communications, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 16,983 15,860 14,971 Dedicated Contract Carriage 16,749 16,800 17,757 Total $ 33,732 32,660 32,728 Fleet Management Solutions Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Full service lease $ 1,848,141 1,785,606 1,766,675 4 % 1 Contract maintenance 141,933 134,492 136,327 6 (1 ) Contractual revenue 1,990,074 1,920,098 1,903,002 4 1 Contract related maintenance 193,134 191,128 178,049 1 7 Commercial rental 665,730 686,343 649,847 (3 ) 6 Other 72,124 67,362 69,743 7 (3 ) Operating revenue(1) 2,921,062 2,864,931 2,800,641 2 2 Fuel services revenue 1,174,984 1,056,260 802,198 11 32 Total revenue $ 4,096,046 3,921,191 3,602,839 4 % 9 Segment NBT $ 368,069 354,354 312,706 4 % 13 Segment NBT as a % of total revenue 9.0% 9.0% 8.7% bps 30 bps Segment NBT as a % of operating revenue (1) 12.6% 12.4% 11.2% 20 bps 120 bps (1) We use operating revenue, a non GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of our FMS business segment and as a measure of sales activity. Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue grew in 2006 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue increased in 2006 due to full service lease growth primarily in North America. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.3%. Contractual revenue growth in 2006 was realized in both FMS product lines. Full service lease revenue grew in 2006 due to higher lease rates and higher levels of sales activity in North America. Contract maintenance revenue increased in 2006 due primarily to new sales activity. In 2007, we expect each of our contractual product lines to demonstrate revenue growth based on 2006 sales activity levels and ongoing investments in new sales and business retention initiatives. Commercial rental revenue decreased in 2006 reflecting a smaller average fleet and lower vehicle utilization from a weakening 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) U.S. commercial rental market. In the fourth quarter of 2006, commercial rental revenue decreased 7% reflecting lower vehicle utilization and pricing. We expect similar unfavorable commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue in 2007; however, we expect percentage revenue declines to be greater in the first half of 2007 and improve in the second half of 2007. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Change Years ended December 31 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 282,528 296,435 292,241 (5 )% 1 Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 277,461 284,187 257,828 (2 )% 10 Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 33,400 34,400 34,700 (3 )% (1 ) Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 24,600 24,700 24,000 % 3 Commercial rental utilization 71.9% 74.6% 76.9% (270 )bps (230 )bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT grew $14 million during 2006 primarily as a result of revenue growth in our full service lease and contract maintenance product lines. The favorable impact of contractual revenue growth was partially offset by reduced commercial rental volumes, higher sales and marketing expenses, compensation related expenses and higher interest expense due primarily to planned higher debt levels to support investments in the full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. 2005 versus 2004 Total revenue grew in 2005 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue for 2005 increased as a result of higher commercial rental and contract related maintenance revenue and the impact of acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $21 million of total additional revenue in 2005. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2005 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.6%. Contractual revenue growth in 2005 was driven by growth in the full service lease product line and was slightly offset by contract maintenance revenue declines. Full service lease revenue increased in 2005 primarily from the acquisition completed in March 2004 and growth in Canada as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) in the first half of 2005. Our U.S. business showed improved revenue growth trends in the second half of 2005 as a result of positive net sales. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue, which generally represents ancillary services supporting core product lines, benefited from ongoing initiatives aimed at growing these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of stronger pricing and revenue contribution attributed to the acquisition completed in March 2004. During 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the fourth quarter of 2005, we also restructured our FMS operations to better service customers and drive future growth in full service lease. FMS NBT grew $42 million in 2005 as a result of improved commercial rental results from higher pricing, higher gains on disposal of used vehicles resulting from stronger volume and pricing, and lower overhead costs, including performance based incentive compensation. Our global fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment and contract maintenance vehicles is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2006 2005 2004 2006/ 2005/ 2005 2004 End of period vehicle count By type: Trucks 65,200 63,200 63,700 3 % (1 ) Tractors 56,100 52,700 51,700 6 2 Trailers 38,900 40,600 43,100 (4 ) (6 ) Other 5,700 5,800 5,900 (2 ) (2 ) Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) By ownership: Owned 160,800 156,500 157,000 3 % Leased 5,100 5,800 7,400 (12 ) (22 ) Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) By product line: Full service lease 117,500 113,700 115,300 3 % (1 ) Commercial rental 37,000 38,400 40,200 (4 ) (4 ) Service vehicles and other 3,500 3,300 3,000 6 10 Active units 158,000 155,400 158,500 2 (2 ) Held for sale(1) 7,900 6,900 5,900 14 17 Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 30,700 26,400 28,500 16 % (7 ) Year to date average vehicle count By product line: Full service lease 114,600 114,400 115,900 % (1 ) Commercial rental 38,700 40,200 39,900 (4 ) 1 Service vehicles and other 3,300 3,300 2,900 14 Active units 156,600 157,900 158,700 (1 ) (1 ) Held for sale(1) 6,700 7,000 5,600 (4 ) 25 Total 163,300 164,900 164,300 (1 )% Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 28,000 27,400 30,100 2 % (9 ) (1) Vehicles held for sale represent all units available for sale including units held for sale reported in the following table for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days (referred to as NLE units).

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. In 2006, the number of NYE units increased due to the volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2006 and 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to higher out servicing of rental units as well as the impact of increased lease replacement activity. We expect the number of NLE units to increase in the near term based on continuing lease replacement activity and planned out servicing of rental vehicles.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2006, GM accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect favorable revenue comparisons to continue over the near term. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups and better margins in our Brazil operations. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a $3 million benefit, net of variable compensation, related to a contract termination. 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was due primarily to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. In 2005, GM accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of 2005. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006 as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. Despite declining revenue growth trends in the second half of 2006, we expect favorable revenue comparisons in 2007 based on planned investments in sales and marketing initiatives. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs, including a hurricane related recovery. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 2005 versus 2004 Total CSS costs declined in 2005 due primarily to cost benefits associated with the insourcing and renegotiation of several information technology infrastructure services and lower performance based incentive compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarter facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarter relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Financing activities 488,202 241,505 (195,760 ) Investing activities (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) (720,113 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (2,327 ) (3,956 ) 9,368 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (88 ) 27,756 (39,656 ) 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, due primarily to higher earnings (adjusted for non cash items) and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Cash provided by financing activities for 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher vehicle capital spending. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. We manage our business to maximize net cash provided by operating activities (operating cash flows) and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,079 326,752 288,674 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,575 6,963 42,839 Collections on direct finance leases 66,274 70,408 63,795 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 Other, net 2,163 512 Total cash generated 1,254,678 1,183,185 1,381,202 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) Acquisitions (4,113 ) (15,110 ) (148,791 ) Free cash flow $ (444,499 ) (231,304 ) 140,253 We used $444 million of free cash flow compared to a use of $231 million in 2005 due to increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We used $231 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $140 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially offset by lower acquisition spending. We anticipate free cash flow levels to improve in 2007 as a result of lower anticipated vehicle capital spending. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,492,720 1,082,332 862,994 Commercial rental 195,023 251,278 241,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 1,104,852 Operating property and equipment 71,772 77,360 59,767 Total capital expenditures 1,759,515 1,410,970 1,164,619 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (64,451 ) (11,591 ) (72,461 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,695,064 1,399,379 1,092,158 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $0.4 million and $54 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital expenditures grew in 2006 and 2005 due to increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after market devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $1.33 billion in 2007 as a result of reduced replacement activity and lower planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2007 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $4 million in 2006, $15 million in 2005 and $149 million in 2004. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2007. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 328,641 188,271 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 600,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 120,568 162,124 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (213,195 ) (200,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (165,324 ) (343,933 ) 620,690 406,462 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (663 ) (4,152 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 2,295 433 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 9,255 (593 ) Total changes in debt 631,577 402,150 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2006, compared with 32% at December 31, 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2006 Equity 2005 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,816,943 164% $ 2,185,366 143 % Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 77,998 117,062 Total obligations $ 2,894,941 168% $ 2,302,428 151 % (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2006 was driven by our increased capital spending required to support our contractual full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A significant downgrade of Ryders debt rating would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2006). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. Throughout 2006, we were in compliance with this and all other restrictive covenants for our revolving credit facility and do not expect the covenants to significantly affect our operations. The ratio at December 31, 2006 was 146%. At December 31, 2006, $113 million was available under the credit facility. During 1986, we issued at a discount $100 million principal amount of unsecured debentures due May 2016, with a stated interest rate of 9.0%, payable semi annually. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we retired $63 million principal amount of these debentures at a premium, which resulted in a charge of $2 million. The charge represents the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. During 2006, we issued $550 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, Ryder filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that was carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had $250 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs that would cause early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 11, 2007. At December 31, 2006, there were no receivables outstanding under the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 113 Shelf registration statement 250 Trade receivables facility 200 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables facility will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. In connection with these leases we have provided limited guarantees of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions during 2004 that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We have not entered into any sale leaseback transactions since 2004. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. In October 2006, Ryder entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of its independent directors. The terms of the indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that to the extent permitted by Florida law, Ryder will indemnify such director acting in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Ryder, against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $17 million and $16 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million and $3 million, respectively, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 332,124 269,720 1,468,587 743,003 2,813,434 Capital lease obligations 621 1,109 474 1,305 3,509 Total debt 332,745 270,829 1,469,061 744,308 2,816,943 Interest on debt(1) 139,648 245,390 138,172 262,139 785,349 Operating leases(2) 108,878 128,425 85,637 47,034 369,974 Purchase obligations(3) 340,427 41,850 4,350 386,627 Total contractual cash obligations 588,953 415,665 228,159 309,173 1,541,950 Insurance obligations(4) 117,311 113,414 47,754 29,930 308,409 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 24,831 3,667 2,010 48,591 79,099 Total $ 1,063,840 803,575 1,746,984 1,132,002 4,746,401 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2006. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations, deferred compensation obligations and derivative contracts. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2007, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $58 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2007 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $56 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Information At December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated net equity charge (after tax) of $201 million compared to $221 million as of December 31, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record a charge related to the unrecognized net actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition asset. The after tax equity charge of $201 million includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 which increased the equity charge by $151 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the equity charge of $178 million, prior to the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158, was principally the 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) result of fully funding accumulated benefit obligations of our primary pension plan. The improved funding levels resulted from strong investment returns on pension plan assets, global pension contributions during 2006, and a reduction in pension obligations as a result of a higher interest rate environment. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 14% in 2006. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2006, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $130 million compared with $12 million in 2005. After considering the 2006 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $56 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute will take effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will have on future pension funding requirements. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plan effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and will participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that meet the grandfathering criteria will be given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plan or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan is being replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plan. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the May 2006 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since March 1, 2006. The May 2006 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the May 2006 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. At December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.8 million shares under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $93 million. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the October 2005 program. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since May 1, 2004. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions, and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the July 2004 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. In October 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a $90 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Under the October 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the October 2003 program. In 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, under the October 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $44 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004. During 2006, we increased our annual dividend to $0.72 per share of common stock. In February 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.03 increase from the $0.18 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2006. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of the interest 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex to comparable earnings from continuing 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required by ITEM 7A is included in ITEM 7 (pages 48 through 50) of PART II of this report. 56 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operations. The following discussion provides a summary of the 2006 and 2005 special items which are discussed in more detail throughout our MD&A: 2006 Earnings for 2006 included an income tax benefit of $7 million, or $0.11 per diluted common share, associated with the reduction of deferred income taxes due to enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws. Earnings for 2006 included a one time, non cash pension accounting charge of $4 million after tax, or $0.06 per diluted common share, to properly account for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements made in 1995 and 2000. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 2005 Earnings for 2005 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share, related to a change in Ohio income tax law. Net earnings for 2005 included (i) income from discontinued operations associated with the reduction of insurance reserves related to discontinued operations resulting in an after tax benefit of $2 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, and (ii) the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for costs associated with the future removal of underground storage tanks resulting in an after tax charge of $2 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share. Excluding the special items listed above, comparable earnings from continuing operations were $246 million, up 12% from $220 million in 2005. Comparable earnings from continuing operations per diluted common share were $3.99, up 17% from $3.41 in 2005. All business segments contributed to the strong results. The earnings growth was driven primarily by contractual revenue growth from each of our business segments, which more than offset the impact of a soft commercial rental market in FMS for the second half of 2006. The results of ongoing cost management initiatives across all business segments and in our central support functions also contributed to the earnings growth in 2006. Earnings per common share growth during 2006 exceeded the earnings growth over the prior periods because the average number of shares outstanding has decreased during the past year reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. With the continuing improvements in earnings over the past three years, we were able to repurchase a total of 3.4 million shares of common stock in 2006 for $159 million. We also increased our annual dividend by 13% to $0.72 per share of common stock. In addition, during 2006 we contributed $130 million to our global pension plans. Capital expenditures increased to $1.76 billion compared with $1.41 billion in 2005. The increase in capital expenditures reflects higher lease vehicle spending for replacements and expansion of customer fleets. The significant amount of capital spending to support contractual revenue growth, as well as pension contributions and share repurchases contributed to the increase in our debt from $2.19 billion at December 31, 2005 to $2.82 billion at December 31, 2006. Our debt to equity ratio also increased to 164% from 143% in 2005. Total obligations (including off balance sheet debt) to equity ratio increased to 168% from 151% in 2005. 2007 Outlook Our outlook for 2007 is positive, despite the uncertainty of our FMS commercial rental business. We expect stable economic conditions in 2007. Our efforts will focus on the implementation of our contractual revenue growth strategies across all business segments while retaining financial discipline. Total revenue is targeted to grow by 5% to 7% while operating revenue is expected to increase by 4% to 5%. We will also 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) continue to focus on cost management and process improvement actions that complement our growth strategies and establish a foundation for sustainable long term profitable growth. As a result, we expect earnings from continuing operations per diluted common share in 2007 to grow by 8% to 10% compared to 2006 comparable earnings from continuing operations per diluted common share. ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY BETWEEN PERIODS Accounting Changes Effective December 31, 2006, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as a liability and record the unrecognized net actuarial loss, unrecognized prior service cost and unrecognized transition asset of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as a component of other comprehensive income. The adoption of this standard reduced total assets by $155 million, total liabilities by $4 million and shareholders equity by $151 million, with no impact to our consolidated statements of earnings and cash flows. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payments. Under SFAS No. 123R, compensation expense was recognized beginning January 1, 2006 and included (a) compensation expense for all share based employee compensation arrangements granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and (b) compensation expense for all share based employee compensation arrangements granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. Results for prior periods have not been restated. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006, earnings before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $10 million ($7 million after tax) lower, than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Both basic and diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $0.12 lower than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under APB No. 25. At December 31, 2006, unrecognized compensation expense from stock options and nonvested shares totaled $20 million, which is expected to be recognized over the next 3.5 years. Effective December 31, 2005, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. The adoption of FIN 47 required us to record an asset retirement obligation related to the future removal of underground storage tanks located at our FMS maintenance facilities. We recognized a cumulative effect charge upon adoption of $2 million on an after tax basis, or $0.04 per diluted common share. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our operating results. Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. FMS Acquisition On March 1, 2004, we completed an asset purchase agreement with Ruan Leasing Company (Ruan) under which we acquired Ruans fleet of approximately 6,400 vehicles, 37 of its 111 service locations and more than 500 customers. Ryder also acquired full service contract maintenance agreements covering approximately 1,700 vehicles. The network operates under Ryders name and has allowed us to leverage our existing U.S. infrastructure in key markets while adding new infrastructure to strengthen our presence in targeted areas of the Midwest, Southeast, Mid Atlantic and Southwest. The results of this acquisition have been included in the consolidated results of Ryder since the date of acquisition. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. (2) Results included restructuring and other charges (recoveries), net of $2 million after tax, or $0.04 per diluted common share, in 2006, $2 million after tax, or $0.03 per diluted common share, in 2005 and $(11) million after tax, or $(0.17) per diluted common share, in 2004. See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges (Recoveries), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. 2006 also included an after tax charge of $4 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, related to the accounting for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements in 1995 and 2000. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. (3) Net earnings for 2005 included (i) income from discontinued operations associated with the reduction of insurance reserves related to discontinued operations resulting in an after tax benefit of $2 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, and (ii) the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for costs associated with the future removal of underground storage tanks resulting in an after tax charge of $2 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased to $393 million in 2006 compared with $357 million in 2005, reflecting better operating performance in all business segments. The 2006 operating performance improvement was driven by contractual revenue growth in each of our business segments, which more than offset the impact of a soft commercial rental market on our FMS business segment results in the second half of 2006. See Operating Results by Business Segment for a further discussion of operating results. Earnings from continuing operations increased to $249 million in 2006 compared with $228 million in 2005. Earnings from continuing operations for 2006 included an income tax benefit of $7 million, or $0.11 per diluted common share, associated with the reduction of deferred income taxes due to enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws and a one time, non cash after tax charge of $4 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, recorded to properly account for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements made in 1995 and 2000. Earnings from continuing operations for 2005 included a state income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share, associated with the reduction of deferred income taxes due to the expected phase out of income taxes for the State of Ohio. Earnings per common share growth during 2006 exceeded the net earnings growth over the prior periods because the average number of shares outstanding has decreased during the past year reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased to $357 million in 2005 compared with $331 million in 2004, reflecting better operating performance in all business segments. Strong FMS commercial rental results, higher gains on FMS used vehicle sales and reductions in operating expenses resulting from ongoing cost reduction activities and process improvement actions across all business segments, were partially offset by the benefit from gains on the 2004 sale of our headquarters complex. Earnings from continuing operations increased to $228 million in 2005 compared with $216 million in 2004. Earnings from continuing operations in 2005 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share, related to a change in Ohio income tax law. Earnings from continuing operations in 2004 benefited from after tax gains on the sale of our headquarters complex of $15 million, or $0.23 per diluted common share, and a net income tax benefit of $9 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share, associated with the resolution of various tax matters. Net earnings in 2005 included an after tax benefit of $2 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, related to discontinued operations and an after tax charge of $2 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share, for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the adoption of FIN 47.

FMS fuel services revenue net of related intersegment billings, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from the operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation revenue in our SCS and DCC business segments is excluded from the operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to our customers and we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Refer to the section titled Non GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of operating revenue to total revenue. All business segments reported revenue growth in 2006. Revenue growth for FMS was driven by higher fuel services revenue, primarily as a result of higher average fuel prices from increased fuel costs, and higher full service lease revenue resulting from higher lease rates and new contract sales. SCS revenue growth was due primarily to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation and higher volumes and new and expanded business. DCC revenue growth was due to expanded and new business as well as pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. Revenue comparisons were also impacted by favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.8% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real. All business segments reported revenue growth in 2005. Additionally, revenue comparisons for all business segments were favorably impacted by pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs which 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) increased fuel services revenue. FMS revenue was also positively impacted by higher rental revenue resulting from stronger pricing and increased contract related maintenance revenue from the implementation of growth initiatives. SCS revenue growth was primarily related to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. In addition, SCS and DCC revenue grew in 2005 due to new and expanded business. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.9% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. The increases in eliminations in 2006 and 2005, primarily reflects the pass through of higher average fuel costs from the FMS segment to SCS and DCC.

Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. The revenue growth from each business segment, excluding fuel, also contributed to the increases in operating expenses.

Average headcount increased 4% in 2006 compared with 2005. The number of employees at December 31, 2006 increased to approximately 28,600, compared with 27,800 in 2005, due primarily to the growth in our SCS business segment. Additionally, on January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R and recognized $10 million of additional share based compensation expense in 2006. See Note 22, Share Based Compensation Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense increased $11 million in 2006 to $70 million compared with 2005. During 2006, we recorded a one time, non cash charge of $6 million ($4 million after tax), to properly account for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements made in 1995 and 2000. The impact of this one time charge was partially offset by a reduction of our 2006 fourth quarter pension expense of $5 million ($3 million after tax) resulting from the interim remeasurement of plan assets and pension obligations. The 2006 pension accounting charge and the benefit attributed to the interim pension remeasurement discussed above were excluded from our segment measure of financial performance. All other increases to pension expense largely impacted our FMS business segment which employs the majority of our employees that participate in the primary U.S. pension plan. See Note 23, Employee 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding these items. Based on actual pension asset returns experienced in 2006, 2006 contributions and interest rate levels at December 31, 2006, we expect pension expense on a pre tax basis to decrease approximately $31 million in 2007, excluding the impact of the $6 million pension accounting charge recorded in 2006. Our 2007 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. Our 2007 interest expense on borrowings will also increase by $5 million because of pension contributions made in the current year. The anticipated decrease in pension expense, net of higher interest on borrowings, would primarily impact our FMS business segment. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Salaries and employee related costs grew for 2005 compared with 2004 as a result of headcount added to support the growth in our SCS business segment, which was offset slightly by reduced performance based incentive compensation and lower employee benefit costs. Average headcount increased 2% in 2005 compared with 2004.

During 2006 and 2005, subcontracted transportation expense in our SCS business segment grew due to increased volumes of freight management activity from new and expanded business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs, resulting from increased fuel costs.

Depreciation expense increased slightly in 2006 compared with 2005, reflecting the impact of a higher average vehicle investment on purchases over the past year. These changes were partially offset by the impact of a lower average fleet count and the adjustments made to residual values and useful lives as part of the annual depreciation review, which were implemented January 1, 2006. The growth in depreciation expense during 2005 compared to 2004 was due to higher vehicle replacement activity within our truck and tractor fleets as well as the conversion of leased vehicles to owned status, partially offset by a decline in our average trailer fleet size. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased in 2006 compared with 2005 due to improved average pricing on vehicles sold, which more than offset the decline in the number of vehicles sold. The improvement in gains on vehicle sales, net in 2005 compared with 2004 was due to an increase in the number of units sold combined with improved average pricing. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease. The increase in equipment rental in 2006 compared with 2005 reflects the impact of higher rental costs associated with investments made in material handling equipment to support the growth in our SCS business, which more than offset the decline in vehicle related rental expense from a smaller average lease count. The decrease in equipment rental in 2005 compared to 2004 was due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles.

Interest expense grew in 2005 reflecting higher average debt levels, resulting from increased capital spending, income tax payments and share repurchases.

Miscellaneous income, net increased in 2006 compared with 2005 due to a 2006 fourth quarter business interruption insurance claim recovery from hurricane related losses of $3 million ($2 million within our FMS business segment and $1 million within our DCC business segment), a one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies and better market performance of investments classified as trading securities. These favorable comparisons were partially offset by a $1 million charge in 2006 related to the settlement of litigation associated with a discontinued operation, as well as the one time recovery in the first quarter of 2005 of $3 million of project costs incurred in prior years. Miscellaneous income, net increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to the previously mentioned one time recovery for project costs incurred in prior years and better market performance of investments classified as trading securities. Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges (recoveries), net $ 3,564 3,376 (17,676 ) 2006 Activity During 2006, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other charges of $4 million that primarily consisted of early debt retirement costs and employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) These charges were partially offset by adjustments to prior year severance and employee related accruals and facility charges. We expect to realize annual pre tax cost savings of approximately $8 million from the 2006 fourth quarter measures once all employee severance actions have been completed. As part of ongoing cost management actions, Ryder incurred $2 million in costs in the fourth quarter to extinguish high interest paying debentures that were originally set to mature in 2016. The total debt retirement costs consisted of the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of the related debt discount and issuance costs. We expect to realize annual pre tax interest savings over the next 4 years of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of this debenture. In the fourth quarter, Ryder also approved a plan to eliminate approximately 150 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions throughout Ryders domestic and international business segments and Central Support Services (CSS). The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million. Although some of these actions were completed as of December 31, 2006, transition plans for eliminating some of the positions will be communicated in the beginning of 2007. Cost reductions associated with the actions that have been completed as of December 31, 2006 will benefit salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2007. Cost reductions associated with the elimination of the other positions will benefit salaries and employee related costs in the latter part of 2007. During 2006 we also had employee related accruals and facility charges recorded in prior restructuring charges that were adjusted due to subsequent refinements in estimates. 2005 Activity During 2005, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other charges of $3 million that consisted of employee severance and benefits, contract termination costs, and closure of leased facilities partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter and related primarily to the restructuring of our U.K. operations, and the offshoring of some administrative finance and support functions that will allow for future cost savings. By December 31, 2006, the 2005 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs in the latter half of 2006. During 2005, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 160 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in Ryders domestic and international FMS and SCS business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $3 million. Cost reductions associated with these actions benefited salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Many of the eliminated positions in our domestic operations were impacted by the decision to outsource certain administrative finance functions to lower cost foreign providers and maximize our technology resources. Transition actions began in February 2006 and continued through the remainder of 2006. We also closed two administrative offices in the U.S. as a result of the restructuring of our FMS domestic business operations and recorded a charge for future cash payments related to lease obligations. Also in 2005, management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced telecommunication services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the outsourcing agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 2010. In accordance with the terms of this service agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling nearly $1 million for contract termination costs. In 2006, the transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses in the latter part of 2006. These charges were partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals due to refinements in estimates. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2004 Activity During 2004, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other recoveries of $18 million that consisted of gains from the sale of the previous headquarters complex and reversals of severance and employee related accruals partially offset by contract termination costs. During 2004, we recognized $24 million in gains from properties sold in connection with the relocation of our headquarters. In May 2004, we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters facility for $39 million in cash and recognized a $22 million gain from the sale. In conjunction with this sale, we entered into a lease agreement with the purchaser to lease back the headquarters facility until we relocated to our new headquarters in April 2005. Also during 2004, we recognized gains totaling $2 million from the sale of properties ancillary to our main headquarters facility. In 2004, as part of ongoing cost containment initiatives, Ryder management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced information technology infrastructure services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the outsourcing agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 2010. In accordance with the terms of the services agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling $8 million for contract termination ($6 million) and transition costs incurred since termination ($2 million). By December 31, 2004, all transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses starting in 2005.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As part of managements evaluation of segment operating performance, we define the primary measurement of our segment financial performance as Net Before Tax (NBT), which includes an allocation of CSS and excludes restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net and 2006 net retirement plan charges. The following table provides a reconciliation of items excluded from our segment NBT measure to their classification within our Consolidated Statements of Earnings: Consolidated Years ended December 31 Statements of Earnings Description Line Item(1) 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Severance and employee related (costs) recoveries Restructuring $ (1,048 ) (2,449 ) 1,216 Facilities and related (costs) recoveries Restructuring (194 ) (181 ) 79 Early retirement of debt Restructuring (2,141 ) Contract termination and transition costs Restructuring (181 ) (746 ) (8,000 ) Gain on sale of headquarter complex Restructuring 24,308 Other Restructuring 73 Restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net (3,564 ) (3,376 ) 17,676 Pension accounting charge(2) Salaries (5,872 ) Pension remeasurement benefit(2) Salaries 4,667 Postretirement benefit plan charge(2) Salaries (1,842 ) 2006 net retirement plan (charges) (3,047 ) Restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net and 2006 net retirement plan charges $ (6,611 ) (3,376 ) 17,676 (1) Restructuring refers to the Restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net and Salaries refers to Salaries and employee related costs on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. (2) See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all of our business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each of our business segments and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, corporate communications, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 16,983 15,860 14,971 Dedicated Contract Carriage 16,749 16,800 17,757 Total $ 33,732 32,660 32,728 Fleet Management Solutions Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Full service lease $ 1,848,141 1,785,606 1,766,675 4 % 1 Contract maintenance 141,933 134,492 136,327 6 (1 ) Contractual revenue 1,990,074 1,920,098 1,903,002 4 1 Contract related maintenance 193,134 191,128 178,049 1 7 Commercial rental 665,730 686,343 649,847 (3 ) 6 Other 72,124 67,362 69,743 7 (3 ) Operating revenue(1) 2,921,062 2,864,931 2,800,641 2 2 Fuel services revenue 1,174,984 1,056,260 802,198 11 32 Total revenue $ 4,096,046 3,921,191 3,602,839 4 % 9 Segment NBT $ 368,069 354,354 312,706 4 % 13 Segment NBT as a % of total revenue 9.0% 9.0% 8.7% bps 30 bps Segment NBT as a % of operating revenue (1) 12.6% 12.4% 11.2% 20 bps 120 bps (1) We use operating revenue, a non GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of our FMS business segment and as a measure of sales activity. Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue grew in 2006 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue increased in 2006 due to full service lease growth primarily in North America. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.3%. Contractual revenue growth in 2006 was realized in both FMS product lines. Full service lease revenue grew in 2006 due to higher lease rates and higher levels of sales activity in North America. Contract maintenance revenue increased in 2006 due primarily to new sales activity. In 2007, we expect each of our contractual product lines to demonstrate revenue growth based on 2006 sales activity levels and ongoing investments in new sales and business retention initiatives. Commercial rental revenue decreased in 2006 reflecting a smaller average fleet and lower vehicle utilization from a weakening 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) U.S. commercial rental market. In the fourth quarter of 2006, commercial rental revenue decreased 7% reflecting lower vehicle utilization and pricing. We expect similar unfavorable commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue in 2007; however, we expect percentage revenue declines to be greater in the first half of 2007 and improve in the second half of 2007. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Change Years ended December 31 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 282,528 296,435 292,241 (5 )% 1 Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 277,461 284,187 257,828 (2 )% 10 Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 33,400 34,400 34,700 (3 )% (1 ) Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 24,600 24,700 24,000 % 3 Commercial rental utilization 71.9% 74.6% 76.9% (270 )bps (230 )bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT grew $14 million during 2006 primarily as a result of revenue growth in our full service lease and contract maintenance product lines. The favorable impact of contractual revenue growth was partially offset by reduced commercial rental volumes, higher sales and marketing expenses, compensation related expenses and higher interest expense due primarily to planned higher debt levels to support investments in the full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. 2005 versus 2004 Total revenue grew in 2005 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue for 2005 increased as a result of higher commercial rental and contract related maintenance revenue and the impact of acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $21 million of total additional revenue in 2005. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2005 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.6%. Contractual revenue growth in 2005 was driven by growth in the full service lease product line and was slightly offset by contract maintenance revenue declines. Full service lease revenue increased in 2005 primarily from the acquisition completed in March 2004 and growth in Canada as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) in the first half of 2005. Our U.S. business showed improved revenue growth trends in the second half of 2005 as a result of positive net sales. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue, which generally represents ancillary services supporting core product lines, benefited from ongoing initiatives aimed at growing these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of stronger pricing and revenue contribution attributed to the acquisition completed in March 2004. During 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the fourth quarter of 2005, we also restructured our FMS operations to better service customers and drive future growth in full service lease. FMS NBT grew $42 million in 2005 as a result of improved commercial rental results from higher pricing, higher gains on disposal of used vehicles resulting from stronger volume and pricing, and lower overhead costs, including performance based incentive compensation. Our global fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment and contract maintenance vehicles is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2006 2005 2004 2006/ 2005/ 2005 2004 End of period vehicle count By type: Trucks 65,200 63,200 63,700 3 % (1 ) Tractors 56,100 52,700 51,700 6 2 Trailers 38,900 40,600 43,100 (4 ) (6 ) Other 5,700 5,800 5,900 (2 ) (2 ) Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) By ownership: Owned 160,800 156,500 157,000 3 % Leased 5,100 5,800 7,400 (12 ) (22 ) Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) By product line: Full service lease 117,500 113,700 115,300 3 % (1 ) Commercial rental 37,000 38,400 40,200 (4 ) (4 ) Service vehicles and other 3,500 3,300 3,000 6 10 Active units 158,000 155,400 158,500 2 (2 ) Held for sale(1) 7,900 6,900 5,900 14 17 Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 30,700 26,400 28,500 16 % (7 ) Year to date average vehicle count By product line: Full service lease 114,600 114,400 115,900 % (1 ) Commercial rental 38,700 40,200 39,900 (4 ) 1 Service vehicles and other 3,300 3,300 2,900 14 Active units 156,600 157,900 158,700 (1 ) (1 ) Held for sale(1) 6,700 7,000 5,600 (4 ) 25 Total 163,300 164,900 164,300 (1 )% Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 28,000 27,400 30,100 2 % (9 ) (1) Vehicles held for sale represent all units available for sale including units held for sale reported in the following table for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days (referred to as NLE units).

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The totals in the table above include the following non revenue earning equipment for the U.S. fleet (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ Number of Units 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 4,200 1,700 1,900 147 % (11 ) No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale 6,600 5,500 4,800 20 15 Other NLE units 1,900 1,400 1,600 36 (13 ) Total(1) 12,700 8,600 8,300 48 % 4 (1) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,700 in 2006 and 1,500 vehicles in 2005 and 2004, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. In 2006, the number of NYE units increased due to the volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2006 and 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to higher out servicing of rental units as well as the impact of increased lease replacement activity. We expect the number of NLE units to increase in the near term based on continuing lease replacement activity and planned out servicing of rental vehicles.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2006, GM accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect favorable revenue comparisons to continue over the near term. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups and better margins in our Brazil operations. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a $3 million benefit, net of variable compensation, related to a contract termination. 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was due primarily to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. In 2005, GM accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of 2005. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006 as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. Despite declining revenue growth trends in the second half of 2006, we expect favorable revenue comparisons in 2007 based on planned investments in sales and marketing initiatives. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs, including a hurricane related recovery. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 2005 versus 2004 Total CSS costs declined in 2005 due primarily to cost benefits associated with the insourcing and renegotiation of several information technology infrastructure services and lower performance based incentive compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarter facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarter relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Financing activities 488,202 241,505 (195,760 ) Investing activities (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) (720,113 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (2,327 ) (3,956 ) 9,368 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (88 ) 27,756 (39,656 ) 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, due primarily to higher earnings (adjusted for non cash items) and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Cash provided by financing activities for 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher vehicle capital spending. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. We manage our business to maximize net cash provided by operating activities (operating cash flows) and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,079 326,752 288,674 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,575 6,963 42,839 Collections on direct finance leases 66,274 70,408 63,795 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 Other, net 2,163 512 Total cash generated 1,254,678 1,183,185 1,381,202 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) Acquisitions (4,113 ) (15,110 ) (148,791 ) Free cash flow $ (444,499 ) (231,304 ) 140,253 We used $444 million of free cash flow compared to a use of $231 million in 2005 due to increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We used $231 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $140 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially offset by lower acquisition spending. We anticipate free cash flow levels to improve in 2007 as a result of lower anticipated vehicle capital spending. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,492,720 1,082,332 862,994 Commercial rental 195,023 251,278 241,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 1,104,852 Operating property and equipment 71,772 77,360 59,767 Total capital expenditures 1,759,515 1,410,970 1,164,619 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (64,451 ) (11,591 ) (72,461 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,695,064 1,399,379 1,092,158 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $0.4 million and $54 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital expenditures grew in 2006 and 2005 due to increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after market devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $1.33 billion in 2007 as a result of reduced replacement activity and lower planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2007 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $4 million in 2006, $15 million in 2005 and $149 million in 2004. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2007. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 328,641 188,271 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 600,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 120,568 162,124 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (213,195 ) (200,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (165,324 ) (343,933 ) 620,690 406,462 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (663 ) (4,152 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 2,295 433 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 9,255 (593 ) Total changes in debt 631,577 402,150 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2006, compared with 32% at December 31, 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2006 Equity 2005 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,816,943 164% $ 2,185,366 143 % Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 77,998 117,062 Total obligations $ 2,894,941 168% $ 2,302,428 151 % (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2006 was driven by our increased capital spending required to support our contractual full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A significant downgrade of Ryders debt rating would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2006). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. Throughout 2006, we were in compliance with this and all other restrictive covenants for our revolving credit facility and do not expect the covenants to significantly affect our operations. The ratio at December 31, 2006 was 146%. At December 31, 2006, $113 million was available under the credit facility. During 1986, we issued at a discount $100 million principal amount of unsecured debentures due May 2016, with a stated interest rate of 9.0%, payable semi annually. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we retired $63 million principal amount of these debentures at a premium, which resulted in a charge of $2 million. The charge represents the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. During 2006, we issued $550 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, Ryder filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that was carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had $250 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs that would cause early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 11, 2007. At December 31, 2006, there were no receivables outstanding under the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 113 Shelf registration statement 250 Trade receivables facility 200 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables facility will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. In connection with these leases we have provided limited guarantees of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions during 2004 that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We have not entered into any sale leaseback transactions since 2004. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. In October 2006, Ryder entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of its independent directors. The terms of the indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that to the extent permitted by Florida law, Ryder will indemnify such director acting in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Ryder, against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $17 million and $16 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million and $3 million, respectively, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 332,124 269,720 1,468,587 743,003 2,813,434 Capital lease obligations 621 1,109 474 1,305 3,509 Total debt 332,745 270,829 1,469,061 744,308 2,816,943 Interest on debt(1) 139,648 245,390 138,172 262,139 785,349 Operating leases(2) 108,878 128,425 85,637 47,034 369,974 Purchase obligations(3) 340,427 41,850 4,350 386,627 Total contractual cash obligations 588,953 415,665 228,159 309,173 1,541,950 Insurance obligations(4) 117,311 113,414 47,754 29,930 308,409 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 24,831 3,667 2,010 48,591 79,099 Total $ 1,063,840 803,575 1,746,984 1,132,002 4,746,401 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2006. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations, deferred compensation obligations and derivative contracts. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2007, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $58 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2007 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $56 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Information At December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated net equity charge (after tax) of $201 million compared to $221 million as of December 31, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record a charge related to the unrecognized net actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition asset. The after tax equity charge of $201 million includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 which increased the equity charge by $151 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the equity charge of $178 million, prior to the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158, was principally the 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) result of fully funding accumulated benefit obligations of our primary pension plan. The improved funding levels resulted from strong investment returns on pension plan assets, global pension contributions during 2006, and a reduction in pension obligations as a result of a higher interest rate environment. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 14% in 2006. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2006, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $130 million compared with $12 million in 2005. After considering the 2006 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $56 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute will take effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will have on future pension funding requirements. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plan effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and will participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that meet the grandfathering criteria will be given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plan or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan is being replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plan. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the May 2006 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since March 1, 2006. The May 2006 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the May 2006 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. At December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.8 million shares under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $93 million. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the October 2005 program. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since May 1, 2004. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions, and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the July 2004 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. In October 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a $90 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Under the October 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the October 2003 program. In 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, under the October 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $44 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004. During 2006, we increased our annual dividend to $0.72 per share of common stock. In February 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.03 increase from the $0.18 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2006. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of the interest 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex to comparable earnings from continuing 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) continue to focus on cost management and process improvement actions that complement our growth strategies and establish a foundation for sustainable long term profitable growth. As a result, we expect earnings from continuing operations per diluted common share in 2007 to grow by 8% to 10% compared to 2006 comparable earnings from continuing operations per diluted common share. ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY BETWEEN PERIODS Accounting Changes Effective December 31, 2006, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as a liability and record the unrecognized net actuarial loss, unrecognized prior service cost and unrecognized transition asset of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as a component of other comprehensive income. The adoption of this standard reduced total assets by $155 million, total liabilities by $4 million and shareholders equity by $151 million, with no impact to our consolidated statements of earnings and cash flows. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payments. Under SFAS No. 123R, compensation expense was recognized beginning January 1, 2006 and included (a) compensation expense for all share based employee compensation arrangements granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and (b) compensation expense for all share based employee compensation arrangements granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. Results for prior periods have not been restated. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006, earnings before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $10 million ($7 million after tax) lower, than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Both basic and diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $0.12 lower than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under APB No. 25. At December 31, 2006, unrecognized compensation expense from stock options and nonvested shares totaled $20 million, which is expected to be recognized over the next 3.5 years. Effective December 31, 2005, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. The adoption of FIN 47 required us to record an asset retirement obligation related to the future removal of underground storage tanks located at our FMS maintenance facilities. We recognized a cumulative effect charge upon adoption of $2 million on an after tax basis, or $0.04 per diluted common share. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our operating results. Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. FMS Acquisition On March 1, 2004, we completed an asset purchase agreement with Ruan Leasing Company (Ruan) under which we acquired Ruans fleet of approximately 6,400 vehicles, 37 of its 111 service locations and more than 500 customers. Ryder also acquired full service contract maintenance agreements covering approximately 1,700 vehicles. The network operates under Ryders name and has allowed us to leverage our existing U.S. infrastructure in key markets while adding new infrastructure to strengthen our presence in targeted areas of the Midwest, Southeast, Mid Atlantic and Southwest. The results of this acquisition have been included in the consolidated results of Ryder since the date of acquisition. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges (Recoveries), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. 2006 also included an after tax charge of $4 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, related to the accounting for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements in 1995 and 2000. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. (3) Net earnings for 2005 included (i) income from discontinued operations associated with the reduction of insurance reserves related to discontinued operations resulting in an after tax benefit of $2 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, and (ii) the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for costs associated with the future removal of underground storage tanks resulting in an after tax charge of $2 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased to $393 million in 2006 compared with $357 million in 2005, reflecting better operating performance in all business segments. The 2006 operating performance improvement was driven by contractual revenue growth in each of our business segments, which more than offset the impact of a soft commercial rental market on our FMS business segment results in the second half of 2006. See Operating Results by Business Segment for a further discussion of operating results. Earnings from continuing operations increased to $249 million in 2006 compared with $228 million in 2005. Earnings from continuing operations for 2006 included an income tax benefit of $7 million, or $0.11 per diluted common share, associated with the reduction of deferred income taxes due to enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws and a one time, non cash after tax charge of $4 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, recorded to properly account for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements made in 1995 and 2000. Earnings from continuing operations for 2005 included a state income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share, associated with the reduction of deferred income taxes due to the expected phase out of income taxes for the State of Ohio. Earnings per common share growth during 2006 exceeded the net earnings growth over the prior periods because the average number of shares outstanding has decreased during the past year reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased to $357 million in 2005 compared with $331 million in 2004, reflecting better operating performance in all business segments. Strong FMS commercial rental results, higher gains on FMS used vehicle sales and reductions in operating expenses resulting from ongoing cost reduction activities and process improvement actions across all business segments, were partially offset by the benefit from gains on the 2004 sale of our headquarters complex. Earnings from continuing operations increased to $228 million in 2005 compared with $216 million in 2004. Earnings from continuing operations in 2005 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share, related to a change in Ohio income tax law. Earnings from continuing operations in 2004 benefited from after tax gains on the sale of our headquarters complex of $15 million, or $0.23 per diluted common share, and a net income tax benefit of $9 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share, associated with the resolution of various tax matters. Net earnings in 2005 included an after tax benefit of $2 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, related to discontinued operations and an after tax charge of $2 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share, for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the adoption of FIN 47.

FMS fuel services revenue net of related intersegment billings, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from the operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation revenue in our SCS and DCC business segments is excluded from the operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to our customers and we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Refer to the section titled Non GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of operating revenue to total revenue. All business segments reported revenue growth in 2006. Revenue growth for FMS was driven by higher fuel services revenue, primarily as a result of higher average fuel prices from increased fuel costs, and higher full service lease revenue resulting from higher lease rates and new contract sales. SCS revenue growth was due primarily to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation and higher volumes and new and expanded business. DCC revenue growth was due to expanded and new business as well as pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. Revenue comparisons were also impacted by favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.8% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real. All business segments reported revenue growth in 2005. Additionally, revenue comparisons for all business segments were favorably impacted by pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs which 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) increased fuel services revenue. FMS revenue was also positively impacted by higher rental revenue resulting from stronger pricing and increased contract related maintenance revenue from the implementation of growth initiatives. SCS revenue growth was primarily related to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. In addition, SCS and DCC revenue grew in 2005 due to new and expanded business. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.9% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. The increases in eliminations in 2006 and 2005, primarily reflects the pass through of higher average fuel costs from the FMS segment to SCS and DCC.

Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. The revenue growth from each business segment, excluding fuel, also contributed to the increases in operating expenses.

Average headcount increased 4% in 2006 compared with 2005. The number of employees at December 31, 2006 increased to approximately 28,600, compared with 27,800 in 2005, due primarily to the growth in our SCS business segment. Additionally, on January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R and recognized $10 million of additional share based compensation expense in 2006. See Note 22, Share Based Compensation Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense increased $11 million in 2006 to $70 million compared with 2005. During 2006, we recorded a one time, non cash charge of $6 million ($4 million after tax), to properly account for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements made in 1995 and 2000. The impact of this one time charge was partially offset by a reduction of our 2006 fourth quarter pension expense of $5 million ($3 million after tax) resulting from the interim remeasurement of plan assets and pension obligations. The 2006 pension accounting charge and the benefit attributed to the interim pension remeasurement discussed above were excluded from our segment measure of financial performance. All other increases to pension expense largely impacted our FMS business segment which employs the majority of our employees that participate in the primary U.S. pension plan. See Note 23, Employee 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding these items. Based on actual pension asset returns experienced in 2006, 2006 contributions and interest rate levels at December 31, 2006, we expect pension expense on a pre tax basis to decrease approximately $31 million in 2007, excluding the impact of the $6 million pension accounting charge recorded in 2006. Our 2007 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. Our 2007 interest expense on borrowings will also increase by $5 million because of pension contributions made in the current year. The anticipated decrease in pension expense, net of higher interest on borrowings, would primarily impact our FMS business segment. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Salaries and employee related costs grew for 2005 compared with 2004 as a result of headcount added to support the growth in our SCS business segment, which was offset slightly by reduced performance based incentive compensation and lower employee benefit costs. Average headcount increased 2% in 2005 compared with 2004.

During 2006 and 2005, subcontracted transportation expense in our SCS business segment grew due to increased volumes of freight management activity from new and expanded business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs, resulting from increased fuel costs.

Depreciation expense increased slightly in 2006 compared with 2005, reflecting the impact of a higher average vehicle investment on purchases over the past year. These changes were partially offset by the impact of a lower average fleet count and the adjustments made to residual values and useful lives as part of the annual depreciation review, which were implemented January 1, 2006. The growth in depreciation expense during 2005 compared to 2004 was due to higher vehicle replacement activity within our truck and tractor fleets as well as the conversion of leased vehicles to owned status, partially offset by a decline in our average trailer fleet size. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased in 2006 compared with 2005 due to improved average pricing on vehicles sold, which more than offset the decline in the number of vehicles sold. The improvement in gains on vehicle sales, net in 2005 compared with 2004 was due to an increase in the number of units sold combined with improved average pricing. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease. The increase in equipment rental in 2006 compared with 2005 reflects the impact of higher rental costs associated with investments made in material handling equipment to support the growth in our SCS business, which more than offset the decline in vehicle related rental expense from a smaller average lease count. The decrease in equipment rental in 2005 compared to 2004 was due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles.

Miscellaneous income, net increased in 2006 compared with 2005 due to a 2006 fourth quarter business interruption insurance claim recovery from hurricane related losses of $3 million ($2 million within our FMS business segment and $1 million within our DCC business segment), a one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies and better market performance of investments classified as trading securities. These favorable comparisons were partially offset by a $1 million charge in 2006 related to the settlement of litigation associated with a discontinued operation, as well as the one time recovery in the first quarter of 2005 of $3 million of project costs incurred in prior years. Miscellaneous income, net increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to the previously mentioned one time recovery for project costs incurred in prior years and better market performance of investments classified as trading securities. Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges (recoveries), net $ 3,564 3,376 (17,676 ) 2006 Activity During 2006, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other charges of $4 million that primarily consisted of early debt retirement costs and employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) These charges were partially offset by adjustments to prior year severance and employee related accruals and facility charges. We expect to realize annual pre tax cost savings of approximately $8 million from the 2006 fourth quarter measures once all employee severance actions have been completed. As part of ongoing cost management actions, Ryder incurred $2 million in costs in the fourth quarter to extinguish high interest paying debentures that were originally set to mature in 2016. The total debt retirement costs consisted of the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of the related debt discount and issuance costs. We expect to realize annual pre tax interest savings over the next 4 years of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of this debenture. In the fourth quarter, Ryder also approved a plan to eliminate approximately 150 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions throughout Ryders domestic and international business segments and Central Support Services (CSS). The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million. Although some of these actions were completed as of December 31, 2006, transition plans for eliminating some of the positions will be communicated in the beginning of 2007. Cost reductions associated with the actions that have been completed as of December 31, 2006 will benefit salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2007. Cost reductions associated with the elimination of the other positions will benefit salaries and employee related costs in the latter part of 2007. During 2006 we also had employee related accruals and facility charges recorded in prior restructuring charges that were adjusted due to subsequent refinements in estimates. 2005 Activity During 2005, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other charges of $3 million that consisted of employee severance and benefits, contract termination costs, and closure of leased facilities partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter and related primarily to the restructuring of our U.K. operations, and the offshoring of some administrative finance and support functions that will allow for future cost savings. By December 31, 2006, the 2005 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs in the latter half of 2006. During 2005, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 160 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in Ryders domestic and international FMS and SCS business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $3 million. Cost reductions associated with these actions benefited salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Many of the eliminated positions in our domestic operations were impacted by the decision to outsource certain administrative finance functions to lower cost foreign providers and maximize our technology resources. Transition actions began in February 2006 and continued through the remainder of 2006. We also closed two administrative offices in the U.S. as a result of the restructuring of our FMS domestic business operations and recorded a charge for future cash payments related to lease obligations. Also in 2005, management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced telecommunication services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the outsourcing agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 2010. In accordance with the terms of this service agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling nearly $1 million for contract termination costs. In 2006, the transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses in the latter part of 2006. These charges were partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals due to refinements in estimates. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2004 Activity During 2004, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other recoveries of $18 million that consisted of gains from the sale of the previous headquarters complex and reversals of severance and employee related accruals partially offset by contract termination costs. During 2004, we recognized $24 million in gains from properties sold in connection with the relocation of our headquarters. In May 2004, we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters facility for $39 million in cash and recognized a $22 million gain from the sale. In conjunction with this sale, we entered into a lease agreement with the purchaser to lease back the headquarters facility until we relocated to our new headquarters in April 2005. Also during 2004, we recognized gains totaling $2 million from the sale of properties ancillary to our main headquarters facility. In 2004, as part of ongoing cost containment initiatives, Ryder management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced information technology infrastructure services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the outsourcing agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 2010. In accordance with the terms of the services agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling $8 million for contract termination ($6 million) and transition costs incurred since termination ($2 million). By December 31, 2004, all transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses starting in 2005.

(2) See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all of our business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each of our business segments and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, corporate communications, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue grew in 2006 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue increased in 2006 due to full service lease growth primarily in North America. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.3%. Contractual revenue growth in 2006 was realized in both FMS product lines. Full service lease revenue grew in 2006 due to higher lease rates and higher levels of sales activity in North America. Contract maintenance revenue increased in 2006 due primarily to new sales activity. In 2007, we expect each of our contractual product lines to demonstrate revenue growth based on 2006 sales activity levels and ongoing investments in new sales and business retention initiatives. Commercial rental revenue decreased in 2006 reflecting a smaller average fleet and lower vehicle utilization from a weakening 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) U.S. commercial rental market. In the fourth quarter of 2006, commercial rental revenue decreased 7% reflecting lower vehicle utilization and pricing. We expect similar unfavorable commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue in 2007; however, we expect percentage revenue declines to be greater in the first half of 2007 and improve in the second half of 2007. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Change Years ended December 31 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 282,528 296,435 292,241 (5 )% 1 Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 277,461 284,187 257,828 (2 )% 10 Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 33,400 34,400 34,700 (3 )% (1 ) Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 24,600 24,700 24,000 % 3 Commercial rental utilization 71.9% 74.6% 76.9% (270 )bps (230 )bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT grew $14 million during 2006 primarily as a result of revenue growth in our full service lease and contract maintenance product lines. The favorable impact of contractual revenue growth was partially offset by reduced commercial rental volumes, higher sales and marketing expenses, compensation related expenses and higher interest expense due primarily to planned higher debt levels to support investments in the full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. 2005 versus 2004 Total revenue grew in 2005 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue for 2005 increased as a result of higher commercial rental and contract related maintenance revenue and the impact of acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $21 million of total additional revenue in 2005. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2005 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.6%. Contractual revenue growth in 2005 was driven by growth in the full service lease product line and was slightly offset by contract maintenance revenue declines. Full service lease revenue increased in 2005 primarily from the acquisition completed in March 2004 and growth in Canada as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) in the first half of 2005. Our U.S. business showed improved revenue growth trends in the second half of 2005 as a result of positive net sales. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue, which generally represents ancillary services supporting core product lines, benefited from ongoing initiatives aimed at growing these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of stronger pricing and revenue contribution attributed to the acquisition completed in March 2004. During 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the fourth quarter of 2005, we also restructured our FMS operations to better service customers and drive future growth in full service lease. FMS NBT grew $42 million in 2005 as a result of improved commercial rental results from higher pricing, higher gains on disposal of used vehicles resulting from stronger volume and pricing, and lower overhead costs, including performance based incentive compensation. Our global fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment and contract maintenance vehicles is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2006 2005 2004 2006/ 2005/ 2005 2004 End of period vehicle count By type: Trucks 65,200 63,200 63,700 3 % (1 ) Tractors 56,100 52,700 51,700 6 2 Trailers 38,900 40,600 43,100 (4 ) (6 ) Other 5,700 5,800 5,900 (2 ) (2 ) Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) By ownership: Owned 160,800 156,500 157,000 3 % Leased 5,100 5,800 7,400 (12 ) (22 ) Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) By product line: Full service lease 117,500 113,700 115,300 3 % (1 ) Commercial rental 37,000 38,400 40,200 (4 ) (4 ) Service vehicles and other 3,500 3,300 3,000 6 10 Active units 158,000 155,400 158,500 2 (2 ) Held for sale(1) 7,900 6,900 5,900 14 17 Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 30,700 26,400 28,500 16 % (7 ) Year to date average vehicle count By product line: Full service lease 114,600 114,400 115,900 % (1 ) Commercial rental 38,700 40,200 39,900 (4 ) 1 Service vehicles and other 3,300 3,300 2,900 14 Active units 156,600 157,900 158,700 (1 ) (1 ) Held for sale(1) 6,700 7,000 5,600 (4 ) 25 Total 163,300 164,900 164,300 (1 )% Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 28,000 27,400 30,100 2 % (9 ) (1) Vehicles held for sale represent all units available for sale including units held for sale reported in the following table for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days (referred to as NLE units).

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The totals in the table above include the following non revenue earning equipment for the U.S. fleet (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ Number of Units 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 4,200 1,700 1,900 147 % (11 ) No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale 6,600 5,500 4,800 20 15 Other NLE units 1,900 1,400 1,600 36 (13 ) Total(1) 12,700 8,600 8,300 48 % 4 (1) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,700 in 2006 and 1,500 vehicles in 2005 and 2004, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. In 2006, the number of NYE units increased due to the volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2006 and 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to higher out servicing of rental units as well as the impact of increased lease replacement activity. We expect the number of NLE units to increase in the near term based on continuing lease replacement activity and planned out servicing of rental vehicles.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2006, GM accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect favorable revenue comparisons to continue over the near term. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups and better margins in our Brazil operations. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a $3 million benefit, net of variable compensation, related to a contract termination. 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was due primarily to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. In 2005, GM accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of 2005. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006 as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. Despite declining revenue growth trends in the second half of 2006, we expect favorable revenue comparisons in 2007 based on planned investments in sales and marketing initiatives. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs, including a hurricane related recovery. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 2005 versus 2004 Total CSS costs declined in 2005 due primarily to cost benefits associated with the insourcing and renegotiation of several information technology infrastructure services and lower performance based incentive compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarter facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarter relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Financing activities 488,202 241,505 (195,760 ) Investing activities (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) (720,113 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (2,327 ) (3,956 ) 9,368 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (88 ) 27,756 (39,656 ) 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, due primarily to higher earnings (adjusted for non cash items) and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Cash provided by financing activities for 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher vehicle capital spending. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. We manage our business to maximize net cash provided by operating activities (operating cash flows) and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,079 326,752 288,674 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,575 6,963 42,839 Collections on direct finance leases 66,274 70,408 63,795 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 Other, net 2,163 512 Total cash generated 1,254,678 1,183,185 1,381,202 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) Acquisitions (4,113 ) (15,110 ) (148,791 ) Free cash flow $ (444,499 ) (231,304 ) 140,253 We used $444 million of free cash flow compared to a use of $231 million in 2005 due to increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We used $231 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $140 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially offset by lower acquisition spending. We anticipate free cash flow levels to improve in 2007 as a result of lower anticipated vehicle capital spending. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,492,720 1,082,332 862,994 Commercial rental 195,023 251,278 241,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 1,104,852 Operating property and equipment 71,772 77,360 59,767 Total capital expenditures 1,759,515 1,410,970 1,164,619 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (64,451 ) (11,591 ) (72,461 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,695,064 1,399,379 1,092,158 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $0.4 million and $54 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital expenditures grew in 2006 and 2005 due to increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after market devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $1.33 billion in 2007 as a result of reduced replacement activity and lower planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2007 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $4 million in 2006, $15 million in 2005 and $149 million in 2004. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2007. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 328,641 188,271 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 600,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 120,568 162,124 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (213,195 ) (200,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (165,324 ) (343,933 ) 620,690 406,462 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (663 ) (4,152 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 2,295 433 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 9,255 (593 ) Total changes in debt 631,577 402,150 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2006, compared with 32% at December 31, 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2006 Equity 2005 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,816,943 164% $ 2,185,366 143 % Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 77,998 117,062 Total obligations $ 2,894,941 168% $ 2,302,428 151 % (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2006 was driven by our increased capital spending required to support our contractual full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A significant downgrade of Ryders debt rating would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2006). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. Throughout 2006, we were in compliance with this and all other restrictive covenants for our revolving credit facility and do not expect the covenants to significantly affect our operations. The ratio at December 31, 2006 was 146%. At December 31, 2006, $113 million was available under the credit facility. During 1986, we issued at a discount $100 million principal amount of unsecured debentures due May 2016, with a stated interest rate of 9.0%, payable semi annually. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we retired $63 million principal amount of these debentures at a premium, which resulted in a charge of $2 million. The charge represents the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. During 2006, we issued $550 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, Ryder filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that was carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had $250 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs that would cause early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 11, 2007. At December 31, 2006, there were no receivables outstanding under the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 113 Shelf registration statement 250 Trade receivables facility 200 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables facility will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. In connection with these leases we have provided limited guarantees of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions during 2004 that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We have not entered into any sale leaseback transactions since 2004. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. In October 2006, Ryder entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of its independent directors. The terms of the indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that to the extent permitted by Florida law, Ryder will indemnify such director acting in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Ryder, against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $17 million and $16 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million and $3 million, respectively, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 332,124 269,720 1,468,587 743,003 2,813,434 Capital lease obligations 621 1,109 474 1,305 3,509 Total debt 332,745 270,829 1,469,061 744,308 2,816,943 Interest on debt(1) 139,648 245,390 138,172 262,139 785,349 Operating leases(2) 108,878 128,425 85,637 47,034 369,974 Purchase obligations(3) 340,427 41,850 4,350 386,627 Total contractual cash obligations 588,953 415,665 228,159 309,173 1,541,950 Insurance obligations(4) 117,311 113,414 47,754 29,930 308,409 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 24,831 3,667 2,010 48,591 79,099 Total $ 1,063,840 803,575 1,746,984 1,132,002 4,746,401 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2006. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations, deferred compensation obligations and derivative contracts. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2007, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $58 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2007 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $56 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Information At December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated net equity charge (after tax) of $201 million compared to $221 million as of December 31, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record a charge related to the unrecognized net actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition asset. The after tax equity charge of $201 million includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 which increased the equity charge by $151 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the equity charge of $178 million, prior to the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158, was principally the 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) result of fully funding accumulated benefit obligations of our primary pension plan. The improved funding levels resulted from strong investment returns on pension plan assets, global pension contributions during 2006, and a reduction in pension obligations as a result of a higher interest rate environment. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 14% in 2006. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2006, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $130 million compared with $12 million in 2005. After considering the 2006 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $56 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute will take effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will have on future pension funding requirements. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plan effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and will participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that meet the grandfathering criteria will be given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plan or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan is being replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plan. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the May 2006 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since March 1, 2006. The May 2006 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the May 2006 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. At December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.8 million shares under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $93 million. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the October 2005 program. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since May 1, 2004. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions, and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the July 2004 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. In October 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a $90 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Under the October 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the October 2003 program. In 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, under the October 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $44 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004. During 2006, we increased our annual dividend to $0.72 per share of common stock. In February 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.03 increase from the $0.18 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2006. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of the interest 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex to comparable earnings from continuing 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. (2) Results included restructuring and other charges (recoveries), net of $2 million after tax, or $0.04 per diluted common share, in 2006, $2 million after tax, or $0.03 per diluted common share, in 2005 and $(11) million after tax, or $(0.17) per diluted common share, in 2004. See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges (Recoveries), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. 2006 also included an after tax charge of $4 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, related to the accounting for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements in 1995 and 2000. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. (3) Net earnings for 2005 included (i) income from discontinued operations associated with the reduction of insurance reserves related to discontinued operations resulting in an after tax benefit of $2 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, and (ii) the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for costs associated with the future removal of underground storage tanks resulting in an after tax charge of $2 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased to $393 million in 2006 compared with $357 million in 2005, reflecting better operating performance in all business segments. The 2006 operating performance improvement was driven by contractual revenue growth in each of our business segments, which more than offset the impact of a soft commercial rental market on our FMS business segment results in the second half of 2006. See Operating Results by Business Segment for a further discussion of operating results. Earnings from continuing operations increased to $249 million in 2006 compared with $228 million in 2005. Earnings from continuing operations for 2006 included an income tax benefit of $7 million, or $0.11 per diluted common share, associated with the reduction of deferred income taxes due to enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws and a one time, non cash after tax charge of $4 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, recorded to properly account for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements made in 1995 and 2000. Earnings from continuing operations for 2005 included a state income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share, associated with the reduction of deferred income taxes due to the expected phase out of income taxes for the State of Ohio. Earnings per common share growth during 2006 exceeded the net earnings growth over the prior periods because the average number of shares outstanding has decreased during the past year reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased to $357 million in 2005 compared with $331 million in 2004, reflecting better operating performance in all business segments. Strong FMS commercial rental results, higher gains on FMS used vehicle sales and reductions in operating expenses resulting from ongoing cost reduction activities and process improvement actions across all business segments, were partially offset by the benefit from gains on the 2004 sale of our headquarters complex. Earnings from continuing operations increased to $228 million in 2005 compared with $216 million in 2004. Earnings from continuing operations in 2005 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share, related to a change in Ohio income tax law. Earnings from continuing operations in 2004 benefited from after tax gains on the sale of our headquarters complex of $15 million, or $0.23 per diluted common share, and a net income tax benefit of $9 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share, associated with the resolution of various tax matters. Net earnings in 2005 included an after tax benefit of $2 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, related to discontinued operations and an after tax charge of $2 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share, for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the adoption of FIN 47.

FMS fuel services revenue net of related intersegment billings, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from the operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation revenue in our SCS and DCC business segments is excluded from the operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to our customers and we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Refer to the section titled Non GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of operating revenue to total revenue. All business segments reported revenue growth in 2006. Revenue growth for FMS was driven by higher fuel services revenue, primarily as a result of higher average fuel prices from increased fuel costs, and higher full service lease revenue resulting from higher lease rates and new contract sales. SCS revenue growth was due primarily to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation and higher volumes and new and expanded business. DCC revenue growth was due to expanded and new business as well as pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. Revenue comparisons were also impacted by favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.8% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real. All business segments reported revenue growth in 2005. Additionally, revenue comparisons for all business segments were favorably impacted by pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs which 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) increased fuel services revenue. FMS revenue was also positively impacted by higher rental revenue resulting from stronger pricing and increased contract related maintenance revenue from the implementation of growth initiatives. SCS revenue growth was primarily related to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. In addition, SCS and DCC revenue grew in 2005 due to new and expanded business. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.9% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. The increases in eliminations in 2006 and 2005, primarily reflects the pass through of higher average fuel costs from the FMS segment to SCS and DCC.

Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. The revenue growth from each business segment, excluding fuel, also contributed to the increases in operating expenses.

Average headcount increased 4% in 2006 compared with 2005. The number of employees at December 31, 2006 increased to approximately 28,600, compared with 27,800 in 2005, due primarily to the growth in our SCS business segment. Additionally, on January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R and recognized $10 million of additional share based compensation expense in 2006. See Note 22, Share Based Compensation Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense increased $11 million in 2006 to $70 million compared with 2005. During 2006, we recorded a one time, non cash charge of $6 million ($4 million after tax), to properly account for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements made in 1995 and 2000. The impact of this one time charge was partially offset by a reduction of our 2006 fourth quarter pension expense of $5 million ($3 million after tax) resulting from the interim remeasurement of plan assets and pension obligations. The 2006 pension accounting charge and the benefit attributed to the interim pension remeasurement discussed above were excluded from our segment measure of financial performance. All other increases to pension expense largely impacted our FMS business segment which employs the majority of our employees that participate in the primary U.S. pension plan. See Note 23, Employee 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding these items. Based on actual pension asset returns experienced in 2006, 2006 contributions and interest rate levels at December 31, 2006, we expect pension expense on a pre tax basis to decrease approximately $31 million in 2007, excluding the impact of the $6 million pension accounting charge recorded in 2006. Our 2007 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. Our 2007 interest expense on borrowings will also increase by $5 million because of pension contributions made in the current year. The anticipated decrease in pension expense, net of higher interest on borrowings, would primarily impact our FMS business segment. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Salaries and employee related costs grew for 2005 compared with 2004 as a result of headcount added to support the growth in our SCS business segment, which was offset slightly by reduced performance based incentive compensation and lower employee benefit costs. Average headcount increased 2% in 2005 compared with 2004. Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $865,475 638,319 424,991 36% 50 Percentage of revenue 14% 11% 8% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. During 2006 and 2005, subcontracted transportation expense in our SCS business segment grew due to increased volumes of freight management activity from new and expanded business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs, resulting from increased fuel costs. Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $ 743,288 740,415 706,028 % 5 Gains on vehicle sales, net (50,766 ) (47,098 ) (34,504 ) 8 37 Equipment rental 103,297 102,816 108,468 (5 ) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased slightly in 2006 compared with 2005, reflecting the impact of a higher average vehicle investment on purchases over the past year. These changes were partially offset by the impact of a lower average fleet count and the adjustments made to residual values and useful lives as part of the annual depreciation review, which were implemented January 1, 2006. The growth in depreciation expense during 2005 compared to 2004 was due to higher vehicle replacement activity within our truck and tractor fleets as well as the conversion of leased vehicles to owned status, partially offset by a decline in our average trailer fleet size. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased in 2006 compared with 2005 due to improved average pricing on vehicles sold, which more than offset the decline in the number of vehicles sold. The improvement in gains on vehicle sales, net in 2005 compared with 2004 was due to an increase in the number of units sold combined with improved average pricing. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease. The increase in equipment rental in 2006 compared with 2005 reflects the impact of higher rental costs associated with investments made in material handling equipment to support the growth in our SCS business, which more than offset the decline in vehicle related rental expense from a smaller average lease count. The decrease in equipment rental in 2005 compared to 2004 was due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles.

Miscellaneous income, net increased in 2006 compared with 2005 due to a 2006 fourth quarter business interruption insurance claim recovery from hurricane related losses of $3 million ($2 million within our FMS business segment and $1 million within our DCC business segment), a one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies and better market performance of investments classified as trading securities. These favorable comparisons were partially offset by a $1 million charge in 2006 related to the settlement of litigation associated with a discontinued operation, as well as the one time recovery in the first quarter of 2005 of $3 million of project costs incurred in prior years. Miscellaneous income, net increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to the previously mentioned one time recovery for project costs incurred in prior years and better market performance of investments classified as trading securities.

The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) These charges were partially offset by adjustments to prior year severance and employee related accruals and facility charges. We expect to realize annual pre tax cost savings of approximately $8 million from the 2006 fourth quarter measures once all employee severance actions have been completed. As part of ongoing cost management actions, Ryder incurred $2 million in costs in the fourth quarter to extinguish high interest paying debentures that were originally set to mature in 2016. The total debt retirement costs consisted of the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of the related debt discount and issuance costs. We expect to realize annual pre tax interest savings over the next 4 years of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of this debenture. In the fourth quarter, Ryder also approved a plan to eliminate approximately 150 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions throughout Ryders domestic and international business segments and Central Support Services (CSS). The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million. Although some of these actions were completed as of December 31, 2006, transition plans for eliminating some of the positions will be communicated in the beginning of 2007. Cost reductions associated with the actions that have been completed as of December 31, 2006 will benefit salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2007. Cost reductions associated with the elimination of the other positions will benefit salaries and employee related costs in the latter part of 2007. During 2006 we also had employee related accruals and facility charges recorded in prior restructuring charges that were adjusted due to subsequent refinements in estimates. 2005 Activity During 2005, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other charges of $3 million that consisted of employee severance and benefits, contract termination costs, and closure of leased facilities partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter and related primarily to the restructuring of our U.K. operations, and the offshoring of some administrative finance and support functions that will allow for future cost savings. By December 31, 2006, the 2005 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs in the latter half of 2006. During 2005, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 160 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in Ryders domestic and international FMS and SCS business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $3 million. Cost reductions associated with these actions benefited salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Many of the eliminated positions in our domestic operations were impacted by the decision to outsource certain administrative finance functions to lower cost foreign providers and maximize our technology resources. Transition actions began in February 2006 and continued through the remainder of 2006. We also closed two administrative offices in the U.S. as a result of the restructuring of our FMS domestic business operations and recorded a charge for future cash payments related to lease obligations. Also in 2005, management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced telecommunication services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the outsourcing agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 2010. In accordance with the terms of this service agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling nearly $1 million for contract termination costs. In 2006, the transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses in the latter part of 2006. These charges were partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals due to refinements in estimates. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2004 Activity During 2004, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other recoveries of $18 million that consisted of gains from the sale of the previous headquarters complex and reversals of severance and employee related accruals partially offset by contract termination costs. During 2004, we recognized $24 million in gains from properties sold in connection with the relocation of our headquarters. In May 2004, we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters facility for $39 million in cash and recognized a $22 million gain from the sale. In conjunction with this sale, we entered into a lease agreement with the purchaser to lease back the headquarters facility until we relocated to our new headquarters in April 2005. Also during 2004, we recognized gains totaling $2 million from the sale of properties ancillary to our main headquarters facility. In 2004, as part of ongoing cost containment initiatives, Ryder management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced information technology infrastructure services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the outsourcing agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 2010. In accordance with the terms of the services agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling $8 million for contract termination ($6 million) and transition costs incurred since termination ($2 million). By December 31, 2004, all transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses starting in 2005.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As part of managements evaluation of segment operating performance, we define the primary measurement of our segment financial performance as Net Before Tax (NBT), which includes an allocation of CSS and excludes restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net and 2006 net retirement plan charges. The following table provides a reconciliation of items excluded from our segment NBT measure to their classification within our Consolidated Statements of Earnings: Consolidated Years ended December 31 Statements of Earnings Description Line Item(1) 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Severance and employee related (costs) recoveries Restructuring $ (1,048 ) (2,449 ) 1,216 Facilities and related (costs) recoveries Restructuring (194 ) (181 ) 79 Early retirement of debt Restructuring (2,141 ) Contract termination and transition costs Restructuring (181 ) (746 ) (8,000 ) Gain on sale of headquarter complex Restructuring 24,308 Other Restructuring 73 Restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net (3,564 ) (3,376 ) 17,676 Pension accounting charge(2) Salaries (5,872 ) Pension remeasurement benefit(2) Salaries 4,667 Postretirement benefit plan charge(2) Salaries (1,842 ) 2006 net retirement plan (charges) (3,047 ) Restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net and 2006 net retirement plan charges $ (6,611 ) (3,376 ) 17,676 (1) Restructuring refers to the Restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net and Salaries refers to Salaries and employee related costs on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. (2) See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all of our business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each of our business segments and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, corporate communications, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue grew in 2006 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue increased in 2006 due to full service lease growth primarily in North America. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.3%. Contractual revenue growth in 2006 was realized in both FMS product lines. Full service lease revenue grew in 2006 due to higher lease rates and higher levels of sales activity in North America. Contract maintenance revenue increased in 2006 due primarily to new sales activity. In 2007, we expect each of our contractual product lines to demonstrate revenue growth based on 2006 sales activity levels and ongoing investments in new sales and business retention initiatives. Commercial rental revenue decreased in 2006 reflecting a smaller average fleet and lower vehicle utilization from a weakening 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) U.S. commercial rental market. In the fourth quarter of 2006, commercial rental revenue decreased 7% reflecting lower vehicle utilization and pricing. We expect similar unfavorable commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue in 2007; however, we expect percentage revenue declines to be greater in the first half of 2007 and improve in the second half of 2007. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Change Years ended December 31 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 282,528 296,435 292,241 (5 )% 1 Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 277,461 284,187 257,828 (2 )% 10 Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 33,400 34,400 34,700 (3 )% (1 ) Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 24,600 24,700 24,000 % 3 Commercial rental utilization 71.9% 74.6% 76.9% (270 )bps (230 )bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT grew $14 million during 2006 primarily as a result of revenue growth in our full service lease and contract maintenance product lines. The favorable impact of contractual revenue growth was partially offset by reduced commercial rental volumes, higher sales and marketing expenses, compensation related expenses and higher interest expense due primarily to planned higher debt levels to support investments in the full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. 2005 versus 2004 Total revenue grew in 2005 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue for 2005 increased as a result of higher commercial rental and contract related maintenance revenue and the impact of acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $21 million of total additional revenue in 2005. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2005 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.6%. Contractual revenue growth in 2005 was driven by growth in the full service lease product line and was slightly offset by contract maintenance revenue declines. Full service lease revenue increased in 2005 primarily from the acquisition completed in March 2004 and growth in Canada as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) in the first half of 2005. Our U.S. business showed improved revenue growth trends in the second half of 2005 as a result of positive net sales. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue, which generally represents ancillary services supporting core product lines, benefited from ongoing initiatives aimed at growing these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of stronger pricing and revenue contribution attributed to the acquisition completed in March 2004. During 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the fourth quarter of 2005, we also restructured our FMS operations to better service customers and drive future growth in full service lease. FMS NBT grew $42 million in 2005 as a result of improved commercial rental results from higher pricing, higher gains on disposal of used vehicles resulting from stronger volume and pricing, and lower overhead costs, including performance based incentive compensation. Our global fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment and contract maintenance vehicles is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2006 2005 2004 2006/ 2005/ 2005 2004 End of period vehicle count By type: Trucks 65,200 63,200 63,700 3 % (1 ) Tractors 56,100 52,700 51,700 6 2 Trailers 38,900 40,600 43,100 (4 ) (6 ) Other 5,700 5,800 5,900 (2 ) (2 ) Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) By ownership: Owned 160,800 156,500 157,000 3 % Leased 5,100 5,800 7,400 (12 ) (22 ) Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) By product line: Full service lease 117,500 113,700 115,300 3 % (1 ) Commercial rental 37,000 38,400 40,200 (4 ) (4 ) Service vehicles and other 3,500 3,300 3,000 6 10 Active units 158,000 155,400 158,500 2 (2 ) Held for sale(1) 7,900 6,900 5,900 14 17 Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 30,700 26,400 28,500 16 % (7 ) Year to date average vehicle count By product line: Full service lease 114,600 114,400 115,900 % (1 ) Commercial rental 38,700 40,200 39,900 (4 ) 1 Service vehicles and other 3,300 3,300 2,900 14 Active units 156,600 157,900 158,700 (1 ) (1 ) Held for sale(1) 6,700 7,000 5,600 (4 ) 25 Total 163,300 164,900 164,300 (1 )% Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 28,000 27,400 30,100 2 % (9 ) (1) Vehicles held for sale represent all units available for sale including units held for sale reported in the following table for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days (referred to as NLE units).

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. In 2006, the number of NYE units increased due to the volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2006 and 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to higher out servicing of rental units as well as the impact of increased lease replacement activity. We expect the number of NLE units to increase in the near term based on continuing lease replacement activity and planned out servicing of rental vehicles.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2006, GM accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect favorable revenue comparisons to continue over the near term. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups and better margins in our Brazil operations. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a $3 million benefit, net of variable compensation, related to a contract termination. 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was due primarily to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. In 2005, GM accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of 2005. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006 as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. Despite declining revenue growth trends in the second half of 2006, we expect favorable revenue comparisons in 2007 based on planned investments in sales and marketing initiatives. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs, including a hurricane related recovery. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 2005 versus 2004 Total CSS costs declined in 2005 due primarily to cost benefits associated with the insourcing and renegotiation of several information technology infrastructure services and lower performance based incentive compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarter facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarter relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Financing activities 488,202 241,505 (195,760 ) Investing activities (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) (720,113 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (2,327 ) (3,956 ) 9,368 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (88 ) 27,756 (39,656 ) 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, due primarily to higher earnings (adjusted for non cash items) and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Cash provided by financing activities for 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher vehicle capital spending. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. We manage our business to maximize net cash provided by operating activities (operating cash flows) and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,079 326,752 288,674 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,575 6,963 42,839 Collections on direct finance leases 66,274 70,408 63,795 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 Other, net 2,163 512 Total cash generated 1,254,678 1,183,185 1,381,202 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) Acquisitions (4,113 ) (15,110 ) (148,791 ) Free cash flow $ (444,499 ) (231,304 ) 140,253 We used $444 million of free cash flow compared to a use of $231 million in 2005 due to increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We used $231 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $140 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially offset by lower acquisition spending. We anticipate free cash flow levels to improve in 2007 as a result of lower anticipated vehicle capital spending. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,492,720 1,082,332 862,994 Commercial rental 195,023 251,278 241,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 1,104,852 Operating property and equipment 71,772 77,360 59,767 Total capital expenditures 1,759,515 1,410,970 1,164,619 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (64,451 ) (11,591 ) (72,461 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,695,064 1,399,379 1,092,158 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $0.4 million and $54 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital expenditures grew in 2006 and 2005 due to increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after market devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $1.33 billion in 2007 as a result of reduced replacement activity and lower planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2007 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $4 million in 2006, $15 million in 2005 and $149 million in 2004. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2007. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 328,641 188,271 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 600,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 120,568 162,124 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (213,195 ) (200,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (165,324 ) (343,933 ) 620,690 406,462 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (663 ) (4,152 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 2,295 433 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 9,255 (593 ) Total changes in debt 631,577 402,150 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2006, compared with 32% at December 31, 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2006 Equity 2005 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,816,943 164% $ 2,185,366 143 % Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 77,998 117,062 Total obligations $ 2,894,941 168% $ 2,302,428 151 % (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2006 was driven by our increased capital spending required to support our contractual full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A significant downgrade of Ryders debt rating would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2006). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. Throughout 2006, we were in compliance with this and all other restrictive covenants for our revolving credit facility and do not expect the covenants to significantly affect our operations. The ratio at December 31, 2006 was 146%. At December 31, 2006, $113 million was available under the credit facility. During 1986, we issued at a discount $100 million principal amount of unsecured debentures due May 2016, with a stated interest rate of 9.0%, payable semi annually. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we retired $63 million principal amount of these debentures at a premium, which resulted in a charge of $2 million. The charge represents the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. During 2006, we issued $550 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, Ryder filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that was carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had $250 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs that would cause early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 11, 2007. At December 31, 2006, there were no receivables outstanding under the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 113 Shelf registration statement 250 Trade receivables facility 200 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables facility will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. In connection with these leases we have provided limited guarantees of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions during 2004 that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We have not entered into any sale leaseback transactions since 2004. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. In October 2006, Ryder entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of its independent directors. The terms of the indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that to the extent permitted by Florida law, Ryder will indemnify such director acting in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Ryder, against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $17 million and $16 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million and $3 million, respectively, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 332,124 269,720 1,468,587 743,003 2,813,434 Capital lease obligations 621 1,109 474 1,305 3,509 Total debt 332,745 270,829 1,469,061 744,308 2,816,943 Interest on debt(1) 139,648 245,390 138,172 262,139 785,349 Operating leases(2) 108,878 128,425 85,637 47,034 369,974 Purchase obligations(3) 340,427 41,850 4,350 386,627 Total contractual cash obligations 588,953 415,665 228,159 309,173 1,541,950 Insurance obligations(4) 117,311 113,414 47,754 29,930 308,409 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 24,831 3,667 2,010 48,591 79,099 Total $ 1,063,840 803,575 1,746,984 1,132,002 4,746,401 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2006. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations, deferred compensation obligations and derivative contracts. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2007, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $58 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2007 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $56 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Information At December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated net equity charge (after tax) of $201 million compared to $221 million as of December 31, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record a charge related to the unrecognized net actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition asset. The after tax equity charge of $201 million includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 which increased the equity charge by $151 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the equity charge of $178 million, prior to the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158, was principally the 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) result of fully funding accumulated benefit obligations of our primary pension plan. The improved funding levels resulted from strong investment returns on pension plan assets, global pension contributions during 2006, and a reduction in pension obligations as a result of a higher interest rate environment. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 14% in 2006. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2006, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $130 million compared with $12 million in 2005. After considering the 2006 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $56 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute will take effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will have on future pension funding requirements. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plan effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and will participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that meet the grandfathering criteria will be given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plan or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan is being replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plan. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the May 2006 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since March 1, 2006. The May 2006 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the May 2006 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. At December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.8 million shares under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $93 million. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the October 2005 program. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since May 1, 2004. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions, and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the July 2004 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. In October 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a $90 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Under the October 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the October 2003 program. In 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, under the October 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $44 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004. During 2006, we increased our annual dividend to $0.72 per share of common stock. In February 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.03 increase from the $0.18 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2006. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of the interest 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex to comparable earnings from continuing 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased to $357 million in 2005 compared with $331 million in 2004, reflecting better operating performance in all business segments. Strong FMS commercial rental results, higher gains on FMS used vehicle sales and reductions in operating expenses resulting from ongoing cost reduction activities and process improvement actions across all business segments, were partially offset by the benefit from gains on the 2004 sale of our headquarters complex. Earnings from continuing operations increased to $228 million in 2005 compared with $216 million in 2004. Earnings from continuing operations in 2005 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share, related to a change in Ohio income tax law. Earnings from continuing operations in 2004 benefited from after tax gains on the sale of our headquarters complex of $15 million, or $0.23 per diluted common share, and a net income tax benefit of $9 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share, associated with the resolution of various tax matters. Net earnings in 2005 included an after tax benefit of $2 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, related to discontinued operations and an after tax charge of $2 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share, for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the adoption of FIN 47.

FMS fuel services revenue net of related intersegment billings, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from the operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation revenue in our SCS and DCC business segments is excluded from the operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to our customers and we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Refer to the section titled Non GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of operating revenue to total revenue. All business segments reported revenue growth in 2006. Revenue growth for FMS was driven by higher fuel services revenue, primarily as a result of higher average fuel prices from increased fuel costs, and higher full service lease revenue resulting from higher lease rates and new contract sales. SCS revenue growth was due primarily to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation and higher volumes and new and expanded business. DCC revenue growth was due to expanded and new business as well as pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. Revenue comparisons were also impacted by favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.8% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real. All business segments reported revenue growth in 2005. Additionally, revenue comparisons for all business segments were favorably impacted by pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs which 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) increased fuel services revenue. FMS revenue was also positively impacted by higher rental revenue resulting from stronger pricing and increased contract related maintenance revenue from the implementation of growth initiatives. SCS revenue growth was primarily related to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. In addition, SCS and DCC revenue grew in 2005 due to new and expanded business. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.9% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. The increases in eliminations in 2006 and 2005, primarily reflects the pass through of higher average fuel costs from the FMS segment to SCS and DCC.

Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. The revenue growth from each business segment, excluding fuel, also contributed to the increases in operating expenses. Change Years ended December 31 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $1,397,391 1,262,160 1,233,038 11% 2 Percentage of revenue 22% 22% 24% Percentage of operating revenue 31% 30% 31% Salaries and employee related costs and salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue increased in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily as a result of added headcount and increased outside labor costs to support the growth in our SCS and DCC business segments, higher share based compensation and higher employee benefit expenses. Average headcount increased 4% in 2006 compared with 2005. The number of employees at December 31, 2006 increased to approximately 28,600, compared with 27,800 in 2005, due primarily to the growth in our SCS business segment. Additionally, on January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R and recognized $10 million of additional share based compensation expense in 2006. See Note 22, Share Based Compensation Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense increased $11 million in 2006 to $70 million compared with 2005. During 2006, we recorded a one time, non cash charge of $6 million ($4 million after tax), to properly account for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements made in 1995 and 2000. The impact of this one time charge was partially offset by a reduction of our 2006 fourth quarter pension expense of $5 million ($3 million after tax) resulting from the interim remeasurement of plan assets and pension obligations. The 2006 pension accounting charge and the benefit attributed to the interim pension remeasurement discussed above were excluded from our segment measure of financial performance. All other increases to pension expense largely impacted our FMS business segment which employs the majority of our employees that participate in the primary U.S. pension plan. See Note 23, Employee 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding these items. Based on actual pension asset returns experienced in 2006, 2006 contributions and interest rate levels at December 31, 2006, we expect pension expense on a pre tax basis to decrease approximately $31 million in 2007, excluding the impact of the $6 million pension accounting charge recorded in 2006. Our 2007 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. Our 2007 interest expense on borrowings will also increase by $5 million because of pension contributions made in the current year. The anticipated decrease in pension expense, net of higher interest on borrowings, would primarily impact our FMS business segment. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Salaries and employee related costs grew for 2005 compared with 2004 as a result of headcount added to support the growth in our SCS business segment, which was offset slightly by reduced performance based incentive compensation and lower employee benefit costs. Average headcount increased 2% in 2005 compared with 2004. Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $865,475 638,319 424,991 36% 50 Percentage of revenue 14% 11% 8% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. During 2006 and 2005, subcontracted transportation expense in our SCS business segment grew due to increased volumes of freight management activity from new and expanded business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs, resulting from increased fuel costs. Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $ 743,288 740,415 706,028 % 5 Gains on vehicle sales, net (50,766 ) (47,098 ) (34,504 ) 8 37 Equipment rental 103,297 102,816 108,468 (5 ) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased slightly in 2006 compared with 2005, reflecting the impact of a higher average vehicle investment on purchases over the past year. These changes were partially offset by the impact of a lower average fleet count and the adjustments made to residual values and useful lives as part of the annual depreciation review, which were implemented January 1, 2006. The growth in depreciation expense during 2005 compared to 2004 was due to higher vehicle replacement activity within our truck and tractor fleets as well as the conversion of leased vehicles to owned status, partially offset by a decline in our average trailer fleet size. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased in 2006 compared with 2005 due to improved average pricing on vehicles sold, which more than offset the decline in the number of vehicles sold. The improvement in gains on vehicle sales, net in 2005 compared with 2004 was due to an increase in the number of units sold combined with improved average pricing. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease. The increase in equipment rental in 2006 compared with 2005 reflects the impact of higher rental costs associated with investments made in material handling equipment to support the growth in our SCS business, which more than offset the decline in vehicle related rental expense from a smaller average lease count. The decrease in equipment rental in 2005 compared to 2004 was due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles.

Interest expense grew in 2005 reflecting higher average debt levels, resulting from increased capital spending, income tax payments and share repurchases.

Miscellaneous income, net increased in 2006 compared with 2005 due to a 2006 fourth quarter business interruption insurance claim recovery from hurricane related losses of $3 million ($2 million within our FMS business segment and $1 million within our DCC business segment), a one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies and better market performance of investments classified as trading securities. These favorable comparisons were partially offset by a $1 million charge in 2006 related to the settlement of litigation associated with a discontinued operation, as well as the one time recovery in the first quarter of 2005 of $3 million of project costs incurred in prior years. Miscellaneous income, net increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to the previously mentioned one time recovery for project costs incurred in prior years and better market performance of investments classified as trading securities. Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges (recoveries), net $ 3,564 3,376 (17,676 ) 2006 Activity During 2006, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other charges of $4 million that primarily consisted of early debt retirement costs and employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) These charges were partially offset by adjustments to prior year severance and employee related accruals and facility charges. We expect to realize annual pre tax cost savings of approximately $8 million from the 2006 fourth quarter measures once all employee severance actions have been completed. As part of ongoing cost management actions, Ryder incurred $2 million in costs in the fourth quarter to extinguish high interest paying debentures that were originally set to mature in 2016. The total debt retirement costs consisted of the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of the related debt discount and issuance costs. We expect to realize annual pre tax interest savings over the next 4 years of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of this debenture. In the fourth quarter, Ryder also approved a plan to eliminate approximately 150 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions throughout Ryders domestic and international business segments and Central Support Services (CSS). The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million. Although some of these actions were completed as of December 31, 2006, transition plans for eliminating some of the positions will be communicated in the beginning of 2007. Cost reductions associated with the actions that have been completed as of December 31, 2006 will benefit salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2007. Cost reductions associated with the elimination of the other positions will benefit salaries and employee related costs in the latter part of 2007. During 2006 we also had employee related accruals and facility charges recorded in prior restructuring charges that were adjusted due to subsequent refinements in estimates. 2005 Activity During 2005, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other charges of $3 million that consisted of employee severance and benefits, contract termination costs, and closure of leased facilities partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter and related primarily to the restructuring of our U.K. operations, and the offshoring of some administrative finance and support functions that will allow for future cost savings. By December 31, 2006, the 2005 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs in the latter half of 2006. During 2005, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 160 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in Ryders domestic and international FMS and SCS business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $3 million. Cost reductions associated with these actions benefited salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Many of the eliminated positions in our domestic operations were impacted by the decision to outsource certain administrative finance functions to lower cost foreign providers and maximize our technology resources. Transition actions began in February 2006 and continued through the remainder of 2006. We also closed two administrative offices in the U.S. as a result of the restructuring of our FMS domestic business operations and recorded a charge for future cash payments related to lease obligations. Also in 2005, management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced telecommunication services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the outsourcing agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 2010. In accordance with the terms of this service agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling nearly $1 million for contract termination costs. In 2006, the transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses in the latter part of 2006. These charges were partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals due to refinements in estimates. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2004 Activity During 2004, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other recoveries of $18 million that consisted of gains from the sale of the previous headquarters complex and reversals of severance and employee related accruals partially offset by contract termination costs. During 2004, we recognized $24 million in gains from properties sold in connection with the relocation of our headquarters. In May 2004, we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters facility for $39 million in cash and recognized a $22 million gain from the sale. In conjunction with this sale, we entered into a lease agreement with the purchaser to lease back the headquarters facility until we relocated to our new headquarters in April 2005. Also during 2004, we recognized gains totaling $2 million from the sale of properties ancillary to our main headquarters facility. In 2004, as part of ongoing cost containment initiatives, Ryder management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced information technology infrastructure services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the outsourcing agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 2010. In accordance with the terms of the services agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling $8 million for contract termination ($6 million) and transition costs incurred since termination ($2 million). By December 31, 2004, all transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses starting in 2005.

(2) See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all of our business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each of our business segments and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, corporate communications, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue grew in 2006 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue increased in 2006 due to full service lease growth primarily in North America. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.3%. Contractual revenue growth in 2006 was realized in both FMS product lines. Full service lease revenue grew in 2006 due to higher lease rates and higher levels of sales activity in North America. Contract maintenance revenue increased in 2006 due primarily to new sales activity. In 2007, we expect each of our contractual product lines to demonstrate revenue growth based on 2006 sales activity levels and ongoing investments in new sales and business retention initiatives. Commercial rental revenue decreased in 2006 reflecting a smaller average fleet and lower vehicle utilization from a weakening 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) U.S. commercial rental market. In the fourth quarter of 2006, commercial rental revenue decreased 7% reflecting lower vehicle utilization and pricing. We expect similar unfavorable commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue in 2007; however, we expect percentage revenue declines to be greater in the first half of 2007 and improve in the second half of 2007. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Change Years ended December 31 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 282,528 296,435 292,241 (5 )% 1 Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 277,461 284,187 257,828 (2 )% 10 Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 33,400 34,400 34,700 (3 )% (1 ) Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 24,600 24,700 24,000 % 3 Commercial rental utilization 71.9% 74.6% 76.9% (270 )bps (230 )bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT grew $14 million during 2006 primarily as a result of revenue growth in our full service lease and contract maintenance product lines. The favorable impact of contractual revenue growth was partially offset by reduced commercial rental volumes, higher sales and marketing expenses, compensation related expenses and higher interest expense due primarily to planned higher debt levels to support investments in the full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. 2005 versus 2004 Total revenue grew in 2005 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue for 2005 increased as a result of higher commercial rental and contract related maintenance revenue and the impact of acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $21 million of total additional revenue in 2005. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2005 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.6%. Contractual revenue growth in 2005 was driven by growth in the full service lease product line and was slightly offset by contract maintenance revenue declines. Full service lease revenue increased in 2005 primarily from the acquisition completed in March 2004 and growth in Canada as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) in the first half of 2005. Our U.S. business showed improved revenue growth trends in the second half of 2005 as a result of positive net sales. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue, which generally represents ancillary services supporting core product lines, benefited from ongoing initiatives aimed at growing these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of stronger pricing and revenue contribution attributed to the acquisition completed in March 2004. During 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the fourth quarter of 2005, we also restructured our FMS operations to better service customers and drive future growth in full service lease. FMS NBT grew $42 million in 2005 as a result of improved commercial rental results from higher pricing, higher gains on disposal of used vehicles resulting from stronger volume and pricing, and lower overhead costs, including performance based incentive compensation. Our global fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment and contract maintenance vehicles is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2006 2005 2004 2006/ 2005/ 2005 2004 End of period vehicle count By type: Trucks 65,200 63,200 63,700 3 % (1 ) Tractors 56,100 52,700 51,700 6 2 Trailers 38,900 40,600 43,100 (4 ) (6 ) Other 5,700 5,800 5,900 (2 ) (2 ) Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) By ownership: Owned 160,800 156,500 157,000 3 % Leased 5,100 5,800 7,400 (12 ) (22 ) Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) By product line: Full service lease 117,500 113,700 115,300 3 % (1 ) Commercial rental 37,000 38,400 40,200 (4 ) (4 ) Service vehicles and other 3,500 3,300 3,000 6 10 Active units 158,000 155,400 158,500 2 (2 ) Held for sale(1) 7,900 6,900 5,900 14 17 Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 30,700 26,400 28,500 16 % (7 ) Year to date average vehicle count By product line: Full service lease 114,600 114,400 115,900 % (1 ) Commercial rental 38,700 40,200 39,900 (4 ) 1 Service vehicles and other 3,300 3,300 2,900 14 Active units 156,600 157,900 158,700 (1 ) (1 ) Held for sale(1) 6,700 7,000 5,600 (4 ) 25 Total 163,300 164,900 164,300 (1 )% Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 28,000 27,400 30,100 2 % (9 ) (1) Vehicles held for sale represent all units available for sale including units held for sale reported in the following table for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days (referred to as NLE units).

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. In 2006, the number of NYE units increased due to the volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2006 and 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to higher out servicing of rental units as well as the impact of increased lease replacement activity. We expect the number of NLE units to increase in the near term based on continuing lease replacement activity and planned out servicing of rental vehicles.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2006, GM accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect favorable revenue comparisons to continue over the near term. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups and better margins in our Brazil operations. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a $3 million benefit, net of variable compensation, related to a contract termination. 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was due primarily to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. In 2005, GM accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of 2005. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006 as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. Despite declining revenue growth trends in the second half of 2006, we expect favorable revenue comparisons in 2007 based on planned investments in sales and marketing initiatives. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs, including a hurricane related recovery. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 2005 versus 2004 Total CSS costs declined in 2005 due primarily to cost benefits associated with the insourcing and renegotiation of several information technology infrastructure services and lower performance based incentive compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarter facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarter relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Financing activities 488,202 241,505 (195,760 ) Investing activities (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) (720,113 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (2,327 ) (3,956 ) 9,368 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (88 ) 27,756 (39,656 ) 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, due primarily to higher earnings (adjusted for non cash items) and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Cash provided by financing activities for 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher vehicle capital spending. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. We manage our business to maximize net cash provided by operating activities (operating cash flows) and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,079 326,752 288,674 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,575 6,963 42,839 Collections on direct finance leases 66,274 70,408 63,795 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 Other, net 2,163 512 Total cash generated 1,254,678 1,183,185 1,381,202 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) Acquisitions (4,113 ) (15,110 ) (148,791 ) Free cash flow $ (444,499 ) (231,304 ) 140,253 We used $444 million of free cash flow compared to a use of $231 million in 2005 due to increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We used $231 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $140 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially offset by lower acquisition spending. We anticipate free cash flow levels to improve in 2007 as a result of lower anticipated vehicle capital spending. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,492,720 1,082,332 862,994 Commercial rental 195,023 251,278 241,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 1,104,852 Operating property and equipment 71,772 77,360 59,767 Total capital expenditures 1,759,515 1,410,970 1,164,619 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (64,451 ) (11,591 ) (72,461 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,695,064 1,399,379 1,092,158 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $0.4 million and $54 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital expenditures grew in 2006 and 2005 due to increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after market devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $1.33 billion in 2007 as a result of reduced replacement activity and lower planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2007 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $4 million in 2006, $15 million in 2005 and $149 million in 2004. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2007. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 328,641 188,271 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 600,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 120,568 162,124 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (213,195 ) (200,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (165,324 ) (343,933 ) 620,690 406,462 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (663 ) (4,152 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 2,295 433 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 9,255 (593 ) Total changes in debt 631,577 402,150 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2006, compared with 32% at December 31, 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2006 Equity 2005 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,816,943 164% $ 2,185,366 143 % Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 77,998 117,062 Total obligations $ 2,894,941 168% $ 2,302,428 151 % (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2006 was driven by our increased capital spending required to support our contractual full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A significant downgrade of Ryders debt rating would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2006). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. Throughout 2006, we were in compliance with this and all other restrictive covenants for our revolving credit facility and do not expect the covenants to significantly affect our operations. The ratio at December 31, 2006 was 146%. At December 31, 2006, $113 million was available under the credit facility. During 1986, we issued at a discount $100 million principal amount of unsecured debentures due May 2016, with a stated interest rate of 9.0%, payable semi annually. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we retired $63 million principal amount of these debentures at a premium, which resulted in a charge of $2 million. The charge represents the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. During 2006, we issued $550 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, Ryder filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that was carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had $250 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs that would cause early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 11, 2007. At December 31, 2006, there were no receivables outstanding under the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 113 Shelf registration statement 250 Trade receivables facility 200 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables facility will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. In connection with these leases we have provided limited guarantees of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions during 2004 that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We have not entered into any sale leaseback transactions since 2004. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. In October 2006, Ryder entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of its independent directors. The terms of the indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that to the extent permitted by Florida law, Ryder will indemnify such director acting in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Ryder, against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $17 million and $16 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million and $3 million, respectively, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 332,124 269,720 1,468,587 743,003 2,813,434 Capital lease obligations 621 1,109 474 1,305 3,509 Total debt 332,745 270,829 1,469,061 744,308 2,816,943 Interest on debt(1) 139,648 245,390 138,172 262,139 785,349 Operating leases(2) 108,878 128,425 85,637 47,034 369,974 Purchase obligations(3) 340,427 41,850 4,350 386,627 Total contractual cash obligations 588,953 415,665 228,159 309,173 1,541,950 Insurance obligations(4) 117,311 113,414 47,754 29,930 308,409 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 24,831 3,667 2,010 48,591 79,099 Total $ 1,063,840 803,575 1,746,984 1,132,002 4,746,401 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2006. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations, deferred compensation obligations and derivative contracts. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2007, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $58 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2007 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $56 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Information At December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated net equity charge (after tax) of $201 million compared to $221 million as of December 31, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record a charge related to the unrecognized net actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition asset. The after tax equity charge of $201 million includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 which increased the equity charge by $151 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the equity charge of $178 million, prior to the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158, was principally the 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) result of fully funding accumulated benefit obligations of our primary pension plan. The improved funding levels resulted from strong investment returns on pension plan assets, global pension contributions during 2006, and a reduction in pension obligations as a result of a higher interest rate environment. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 14% in 2006. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2006, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $130 million compared with $12 million in 2005. After considering the 2006 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $56 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute will take effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will have on future pension funding requirements. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plan effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and will participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that meet the grandfathering criteria will be given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plan or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan is being replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plan. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the May 2006 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since March 1, 2006. The May 2006 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the May 2006 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. At December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.8 million shares under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $93 million. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the October 2005 program. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since May 1, 2004. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions, and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the July 2004 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. In October 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a $90 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Under the October 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the October 2003 program. In 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, under the October 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $44 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004. During 2006, we increased our annual dividend to $0.72 per share of common stock. In February 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.03 increase from the $0.18 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2006. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of the interest 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex to comparable earnings from continuing 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) increased fuel services revenue. FMS revenue was also positively impacted by higher rental revenue resulting from stronger pricing and increased contract related maintenance revenue from the implementation of growth initiatives. SCS revenue growth was primarily related to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. In addition, SCS and DCC revenue grew in 2005 due to new and expanded business. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.9% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. The increases in eliminations in 2006 and 2005, primarily reflects the pass through of higher average fuel costs from the FMS segment to SCS and DCC. Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Operating expense (exclusive of items shown separately) $2,722,592 2,572,241 2,305,322 6% 12 Percentage of revenue 43% 45% 45% Operating expense grew for 2006 and 2005 principally as a result of higher fuel costs due to higher average market prices. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. The revenue growth from each business segment, excluding fuel, also contributed to the increases in operating expenses. Change Years ended December 31 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $1,397,391 1,262,160 1,233,038 11% 2 Percentage of revenue 22% 22% 24% Percentage of operating revenue 31% 30% 31% Salaries and employee related costs and salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue increased in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily as a result of added headcount and increased outside labor costs to support the growth in our SCS and DCC business segments, higher share based compensation and higher employee benefit expenses. Average headcount increased 4% in 2006 compared with 2005. The number of employees at December 31, 2006 increased to approximately 28,600, compared with 27,800 in 2005, due primarily to the growth in our SCS business segment. Additionally, on January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R and recognized $10 million of additional share based compensation expense in 2006. See Note 22, Share Based Compensation Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense increased $11 million in 2006 to $70 million compared with 2005. During 2006, we recorded a one time, non cash charge of $6 million ($4 million after tax), to properly account for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements made in 1995 and 2000. The impact of this one time charge was partially offset by a reduction of our 2006 fourth quarter pension expense of $5 million ($3 million after tax) resulting from the interim remeasurement of plan assets and pension obligations. The 2006 pension accounting charge and the benefit attributed to the interim pension remeasurement discussed above were excluded from our segment measure of financial performance. All other increases to pension expense largely impacted our FMS business segment which employs the majority of our employees that participate in the primary U.S. pension plan. See Note 23, Employee 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding these items. Based on actual pension asset returns experienced in 2006, 2006 contributions and interest rate levels at December 31, 2006, we expect pension expense on a pre tax basis to decrease approximately $31 million in 2007, excluding the impact of the $6 million pension accounting charge recorded in 2006. Our 2007 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. Our 2007 interest expense on borrowings will also increase by $5 million because of pension contributions made in the current year. The anticipated decrease in pension expense, net of higher interest on borrowings, would primarily impact our FMS business segment. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Salaries and employee related costs grew for 2005 compared with 2004 as a result of headcount added to support the growth in our SCS business segment, which was offset slightly by reduced performance based incentive compensation and lower employee benefit costs. Average headcount increased 2% in 2005 compared with 2004. Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $865,475 638,319 424,991 36% 50 Percentage of revenue 14% 11% 8% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. During 2006 and 2005, subcontracted transportation expense in our SCS business segment grew due to increased volumes of freight management activity from new and expanded business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs, resulting from increased fuel costs. Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $ 743,288 740,415 706,028 % 5 Gains on vehicle sales, net (50,766 ) (47,098 ) (34,504 ) 8 37 Equipment rental 103,297 102,816 108,468 (5 ) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased slightly in 2006 compared with 2005, reflecting the impact of a higher average vehicle investment on purchases over the past year. These changes were partially offset by the impact of a lower average fleet count and the adjustments made to residual values and useful lives as part of the annual depreciation review, which were implemented January 1, 2006. The growth in depreciation expense during 2005 compared to 2004 was due to higher vehicle replacement activity within our truck and tractor fleets as well as the conversion of leased vehicles to owned status, partially offset by a decline in our average trailer fleet size. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased in 2006 compared with 2005 due to improved average pricing on vehicles sold, which more than offset the decline in the number of vehicles sold. The improvement in gains on vehicle sales, net in 2005 compared with 2004 was due to an increase in the number of units sold combined with improved average pricing. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease. The increase in equipment rental in 2006 compared with 2005 reflects the impact of higher rental costs associated with investments made in material handling equipment to support the growth in our SCS business, which more than offset the decline in vehicle related rental expense from a smaller average lease count. The decrease in equipment rental in 2005 compared to 2004 was due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles.

Interest expense grew in 2005 reflecting higher average debt levels, resulting from increased capital spending, income tax payments and share repurchases.

Miscellaneous income, net increased in 2006 compared with 2005 due to a 2006 fourth quarter business interruption insurance claim recovery from hurricane related losses of $3 million ($2 million within our FMS business segment and $1 million within our DCC business segment), a one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies and better market performance of investments classified as trading securities. These favorable comparisons were partially offset by a $1 million charge in 2006 related to the settlement of litigation associated with a discontinued operation, as well as the one time recovery in the first quarter of 2005 of $3 million of project costs incurred in prior years. Miscellaneous income, net increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to the previously mentioned one time recovery for project costs incurred in prior years and better market performance of investments classified as trading securities. Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges (recoveries), net $ 3,564 3,376 (17,676 ) 2006 Activity During 2006, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other charges of $4 million that primarily consisted of early debt retirement costs and employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) These charges were partially offset by adjustments to prior year severance and employee related accruals and facility charges. We expect to realize annual pre tax cost savings of approximately $8 million from the 2006 fourth quarter measures once all employee severance actions have been completed. As part of ongoing cost management actions, Ryder incurred $2 million in costs in the fourth quarter to extinguish high interest paying debentures that were originally set to mature in 2016. The total debt retirement costs consisted of the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of the related debt discount and issuance costs. We expect to realize annual pre tax interest savings over the next 4 years of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of this debenture. In the fourth quarter, Ryder also approved a plan to eliminate approximately 150 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions throughout Ryders domestic and international business segments and Central Support Services (CSS). The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million. Although some of these actions were completed as of December 31, 2006, transition plans for eliminating some of the positions will be communicated in the beginning of 2007. Cost reductions associated with the actions that have been completed as of December 31, 2006 will benefit salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2007. Cost reductions associated with the elimination of the other positions will benefit salaries and employee related costs in the latter part of 2007. During 2006 we also had employee related accruals and facility charges recorded in prior restructuring charges that were adjusted due to subsequent refinements in estimates. 2005 Activity During 2005, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other charges of $3 million that consisted of employee severance and benefits, contract termination costs, and closure of leased facilities partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter and related primarily to the restructuring of our U.K. operations, and the offshoring of some administrative finance and support functions that will allow for future cost savings. By December 31, 2006, the 2005 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs in the latter half of 2006. During 2005, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 160 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in Ryders domestic and international FMS and SCS business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $3 million. Cost reductions associated with these actions benefited salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Many of the eliminated positions in our domestic operations were impacted by the decision to outsource certain administrative finance functions to lower cost foreign providers and maximize our technology resources. Transition actions began in February 2006 and continued through the remainder of 2006. We also closed two administrative offices in the U.S. as a result of the restructuring of our FMS domestic business operations and recorded a charge for future cash payments related to lease obligations. Also in 2005, management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced telecommunication services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the outsourcing agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 2010. In accordance with the terms of this service agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling nearly $1 million for contract termination costs. In 2006, the transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses in the latter part of 2006. These charges were partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals due to refinements in estimates. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2004 Activity During 2004, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other recoveries of $18 million that consisted of gains from the sale of the previous headquarters complex and reversals of severance and employee related accruals partially offset by contract termination costs. During 2004, we recognized $24 million in gains from properties sold in connection with the relocation of our headquarters. In May 2004, we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters facility for $39 million in cash and recognized a $22 million gain from the sale. In conjunction with this sale, we entered into a lease agreement with the purchaser to lease back the headquarters facility until we relocated to our new headquarters in April 2005. Also during 2004, we recognized gains totaling $2 million from the sale of properties ancillary to our main headquarters facility. In 2004, as part of ongoing cost containment initiatives, Ryder management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced information technology infrastructure services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the outsourcing agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 2010. In accordance with the terms of the services agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling $8 million for contract termination ($6 million) and transition costs incurred since termination ($2 million). By December 31, 2004, all transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses starting in 2005.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As part of managements evaluation of segment operating performance, we define the primary measurement of our segment financial performance as Net Before Tax (NBT), which includes an allocation of CSS and excludes restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net and 2006 net retirement plan charges. The following table provides a reconciliation of items excluded from our segment NBT measure to their classification within our Consolidated Statements of Earnings: Consolidated Years ended December 31 Statements of Earnings Description Line Item(1) 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Severance and employee related (costs) recoveries Restructuring $ (1,048 ) (2,449 ) 1,216 Facilities and related (costs) recoveries Restructuring (194 ) (181 ) 79 Early retirement of debt Restructuring (2,141 ) Contract termination and transition costs Restructuring (181 ) (746 ) (8,000 ) Gain on sale of headquarter complex Restructuring 24,308 Other Restructuring 73 Restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net (3,564 ) (3,376 ) 17,676 Pension accounting charge(2) Salaries (5,872 ) Pension remeasurement benefit(2) Salaries 4,667 Postretirement benefit plan charge(2) Salaries (1,842 ) 2006 net retirement plan (charges) (3,047 ) Restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net and 2006 net retirement plan charges $ (6,611 ) (3,376 ) 17,676 (1) Restructuring refers to the Restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net and Salaries refers to Salaries and employee related costs on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. (2) See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all of our business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each of our business segments and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, corporate communications, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 16,983 15,860 14,971 Dedicated Contract Carriage 16,749 16,800 17,757 Total $ 33,732 32,660 32,728 Fleet Management Solutions Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Full service lease $ 1,848,141 1,785,606 1,766,675 4 % 1 Contract maintenance 141,933 134,492 136,327 6 (1 ) Contractual revenue 1,990,074 1,920,098 1,903,002 4 1 Contract related maintenance 193,134 191,128 178,049 1 7 Commercial rental 665,730 686,343 649,847 (3 ) 6 Other 72,124 67,362 69,743 7 (3 ) Operating revenue(1) 2,921,062 2,864,931 2,800,641 2 2 Fuel services revenue 1,174,984 1,056,260 802,198 11 32 Total revenue $ 4,096,046 3,921,191 3,602,839 4 % 9 Segment NBT $ 368,069 354,354 312,706 4 % 13 Segment NBT as a % of total revenue 9.0% 9.0% 8.7% bps 30 bps Segment NBT as a % of operating revenue (1) 12.6% 12.4% 11.2% 20 bps 120 bps (1) We use operating revenue, a non GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of our FMS business segment and as a measure of sales activity. Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue grew in 2006 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue increased in 2006 due to full service lease growth primarily in North America. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.3%. Contractual revenue growth in 2006 was realized in both FMS product lines. Full service lease revenue grew in 2006 due to higher lease rates and higher levels of sales activity in North America. Contract maintenance revenue increased in 2006 due primarily to new sales activity. In 2007, we expect each of our contractual product lines to demonstrate revenue growth based on 2006 sales activity levels and ongoing investments in new sales and business retention initiatives. Commercial rental revenue decreased in 2006 reflecting a smaller average fleet and lower vehicle utilization from a weakening 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) U.S. commercial rental market. In the fourth quarter of 2006, commercial rental revenue decreased 7% reflecting lower vehicle utilization and pricing. We expect similar unfavorable commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue in 2007; however, we expect percentage revenue declines to be greater in the first half of 2007 and improve in the second half of 2007. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Change Years ended December 31 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 282,528 296,435 292,241 (5 )% 1 Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 277,461 284,187 257,828 (2 )% 10 Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 33,400 34,400 34,700 (3 )% (1 ) Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 24,600 24,700 24,000 % 3 Commercial rental utilization 71.9% 74.6% 76.9% (270 )bps (230 )bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT grew $14 million during 2006 primarily as a result of revenue growth in our full service lease and contract maintenance product lines. The favorable impact of contractual revenue growth was partially offset by reduced commercial rental volumes, higher sales and marketing expenses, compensation related expenses and higher interest expense due primarily to planned higher debt levels to support investments in the full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. 2005 versus 2004 Total revenue grew in 2005 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue for 2005 increased as a result of higher commercial rental and contract related maintenance revenue and the impact of acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $21 million of total additional revenue in 2005. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2005 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.6%. Contractual revenue growth in 2005 was driven by growth in the full service lease product line and was slightly offset by contract maintenance revenue declines. Full service lease revenue increased in 2005 primarily from the acquisition completed in March 2004 and growth in Canada as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) in the first half of 2005. Our U.S. business showed improved revenue growth trends in the second half of 2005 as a result of positive net sales. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue, which generally represents ancillary services supporting core product lines, benefited from ongoing initiatives aimed at growing these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of stronger pricing and revenue contribution attributed to the acquisition completed in March 2004. During 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the fourth quarter of 2005, we also restructured our FMS operations to better service customers and drive future growth in full service lease. FMS NBT grew $42 million in 2005 as a result of improved commercial rental results from higher pricing, higher gains on disposal of used vehicles resulting from stronger volume and pricing, and lower overhead costs, including performance based incentive compensation. Our global fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment and contract maintenance vehicles is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2006 2005 2004 2006/ 2005/ 2005 2004 End of period vehicle count By type: Trucks 65,200 63,200 63,700 3 % (1 ) Tractors 56,100 52,700 51,700 6 2 Trailers 38,900 40,600 43,100 (4 ) (6 ) Other 5,700 5,800 5,900 (2 ) (2 ) Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) By ownership: Owned 160,800 156,500 157,000 3 % Leased 5,100 5,800 7,400 (12 ) (22 ) Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) By product line: Full service lease 117,500 113,700 115,300 3 % (1 ) Commercial rental 37,000 38,400 40,200 (4 ) (4 ) Service vehicles and other 3,500 3,300 3,000 6 10 Active units 158,000 155,400 158,500 2 (2 ) Held for sale(1) 7,900 6,900 5,900 14 17 Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 30,700 26,400 28,500 16 % (7 ) Year to date average vehicle count By product line: Full service lease 114,600 114,400 115,900 % (1 ) Commercial rental 38,700 40,200 39,900 (4 ) 1 Service vehicles and other 3,300 3,300 2,900 14 Active units 156,600 157,900 158,700 (1 ) (1 ) Held for sale(1) 6,700 7,000 5,600 (4 ) 25 Total 163,300 164,900 164,300 (1 )% Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 28,000 27,400 30,100 2 % (9 ) (1) Vehicles held for sale represent all units available for sale including units held for sale reported in the following table for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days (referred to as NLE units).

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. In 2006, the number of NYE units increased due to the volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2006 and 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to higher out servicing of rental units as well as the impact of increased lease replacement activity. We expect the number of NLE units to increase in the near term based on continuing lease replacement activity and planned out servicing of rental vehicles.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2006, GM accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect favorable revenue comparisons to continue over the near term. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups and better margins in our Brazil operations. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a $3 million benefit, net of variable compensation, related to a contract termination. 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was due primarily to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. In 2005, GM accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of 2005. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006 as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. Despite declining revenue growth trends in the second half of 2006, we expect favorable revenue comparisons in 2007 based on planned investments in sales and marketing initiatives. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs, including a hurricane related recovery. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 2005 versus 2004 Total CSS costs declined in 2005 due primarily to cost benefits associated with the insourcing and renegotiation of several information technology infrastructure services and lower performance based incentive compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarter facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarter relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Financing activities 488,202 241,505 (195,760 ) Investing activities (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) (720,113 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (2,327 ) (3,956 ) 9,368 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (88 ) 27,756 (39,656 ) 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, due primarily to higher earnings (adjusted for non cash items) and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Cash provided by financing activities for 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher vehicle capital spending. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. We manage our business to maximize net cash provided by operating activities (operating cash flows) and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,079 326,752 288,674 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,575 6,963 42,839 Collections on direct finance leases 66,274 70,408 63,795 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 Other, net 2,163 512 Total cash generated 1,254,678 1,183,185 1,381,202 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) Acquisitions (4,113 ) (15,110 ) (148,791 ) Free cash flow $ (444,499 ) (231,304 ) 140,253 We used $444 million of free cash flow compared to a use of $231 million in 2005 due to increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We used $231 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $140 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially offset by lower acquisition spending. We anticipate free cash flow levels to improve in 2007 as a result of lower anticipated vehicle capital spending. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,492,720 1,082,332 862,994 Commercial rental 195,023 251,278 241,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 1,104,852 Operating property and equipment 71,772 77,360 59,767 Total capital expenditures 1,759,515 1,410,970 1,164,619 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (64,451 ) (11,591 ) (72,461 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,695,064 1,399,379 1,092,158 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $0.4 million and $54 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital expenditures grew in 2006 and 2005 due to increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after market devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $1.33 billion in 2007 as a result of reduced replacement activity and lower planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2007 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $4 million in 2006, $15 million in 2005 and $149 million in 2004. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2007. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 328,641 188,271 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 600,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 120,568 162,124 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (213,195 ) (200,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (165,324 ) (343,933 ) 620,690 406,462 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (663 ) (4,152 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 2,295 433 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 9,255 (593 ) Total changes in debt 631,577 402,150 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2006, compared with 32% at December 31, 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2006 Equity 2005 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,816,943 164% $ 2,185,366 143 % Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 77,998 117,062 Total obligations $ 2,894,941 168% $ 2,302,428 151 % (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2006 was driven by our increased capital spending required to support our contractual full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A significant downgrade of Ryders debt rating would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2006). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. Throughout 2006, we were in compliance with this and all other restrictive covenants for our revolving credit facility and do not expect the covenants to significantly affect our operations. The ratio at December 31, 2006 was 146%. At December 31, 2006, $113 million was available under the credit facility. During 1986, we issued at a discount $100 million principal amount of unsecured debentures due May 2016, with a stated interest rate of 9.0%, payable semi annually. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we retired $63 million principal amount of these debentures at a premium, which resulted in a charge of $2 million. The charge represents the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. During 2006, we issued $550 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, Ryder filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that was carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had $250 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs that would cause early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 11, 2007. At December 31, 2006, there were no receivables outstanding under the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 113 Shelf registration statement 250 Trade receivables facility 200 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables facility will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. In connection with these leases we have provided limited guarantees of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions during 2004 that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We have not entered into any sale leaseback transactions since 2004. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. In October 2006, Ryder entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of its independent directors. The terms of the indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that to the extent permitted by Florida law, Ryder will indemnify such director acting in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Ryder, against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $17 million and $16 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million and $3 million, respectively, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 332,124 269,720 1,468,587 743,003 2,813,434 Capital lease obligations 621 1,109 474 1,305 3,509 Total debt 332,745 270,829 1,469,061 744,308 2,816,943 Interest on debt(1) 139,648 245,390 138,172 262,139 785,349 Operating leases(2) 108,878 128,425 85,637 47,034 369,974 Purchase obligations(3) 340,427 41,850 4,350 386,627 Total contractual cash obligations 588,953 415,665 228,159 309,173 1,541,950 Insurance obligations(4) 117,311 113,414 47,754 29,930 308,409 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 24,831 3,667 2,010 48,591 79,099 Total $ 1,063,840 803,575 1,746,984 1,132,002 4,746,401 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2006. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations, deferred compensation obligations and derivative contracts. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2007, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $58 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2007 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $56 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Information At December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated net equity charge (after tax) of $201 million compared to $221 million as of December 31, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record a charge related to the unrecognized net actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition asset. The after tax equity charge of $201 million includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 which increased the equity charge by $151 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the equity charge of $178 million, prior to the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158, was principally the 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) result of fully funding accumulated benefit obligations of our primary pension plan. The improved funding levels resulted from strong investment returns on pension plan assets, global pension contributions during 2006, and a reduction in pension obligations as a result of a higher interest rate environment. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 14% in 2006. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2006, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $130 million compared with $12 million in 2005. After considering the 2006 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $56 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute will take effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will have on future pension funding requirements. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plan effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and will participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that meet the grandfathering criteria will be given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plan or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan is being replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plan. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the May 2006 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since March 1, 2006. The May 2006 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the May 2006 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. At December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.8 million shares under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $93 million. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the October 2005 program. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since May 1, 2004. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions, and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the July 2004 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. In October 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a $90 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Under the October 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the October 2003 program. In 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, under the October 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $44 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004. During 2006, we increased our annual dividend to $0.72 per share of common stock. In February 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.03 increase from the $0.18 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2006. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of the interest 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex to comparable earnings from continuing 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding these items. Based on actual pension asset returns experienced in 2006, 2006 contributions and interest rate levels at December 31, 2006, we expect pension expense on a pre tax basis to decrease approximately $31 million in 2007, excluding the impact of the $6 million pension accounting charge recorded in 2006. Our 2007 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. Our 2007 interest expense on borrowings will also increase by $5 million because of pension contributions made in the current year. The anticipated decrease in pension expense, net of higher interest on borrowings, would primarily impact our FMS business segment. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Salaries and employee related costs grew for 2005 compared with 2004 as a result of headcount added to support the growth in our SCS business segment, which was offset slightly by reduced performance based incentive compensation and lower employee benefit costs. Average headcount increased 2% in 2005 compared with 2004. Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $865,475 638,319 424,991 36% 50 Percentage of revenue 14% 11% 8% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. During 2006 and 2005, subcontracted transportation expense in our SCS business segment grew due to increased volumes of freight management activity from new and expanded business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs, resulting from increased fuel costs. Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $ 743,288 740,415 706,028 % 5 Gains on vehicle sales, net (50,766 ) (47,098 ) (34,504 ) 8 37 Equipment rental 103,297 102,816 108,468 (5 ) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased slightly in 2006 compared with 2005, reflecting the impact of a higher average vehicle investment on purchases over the past year. These changes were partially offset by the impact of a lower average fleet count and the adjustments made to residual values and useful lives as part of the annual depreciation review, which were implemented January 1, 2006. The growth in depreciation expense during 2005 compared to 2004 was due to higher vehicle replacement activity within our truck and tractor fleets as well as the conversion of leased vehicles to owned status, partially offset by a decline in our average trailer fleet size. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased in 2006 compared with 2005 due to improved average pricing on vehicles sold, which more than offset the decline in the number of vehicles sold. The improvement in gains on vehicle sales, net in 2005 compared with 2004 was due to an increase in the number of units sold combined with improved average pricing. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease. The increase in equipment rental in 2006 compared with 2005 reflects the impact of higher rental costs associated with investments made in material handling equipment to support the growth in our SCS business, which more than offset the decline in vehicle related rental expense from a smaller average lease count. The decrease in equipment rental in 2005 compared to 2004 was due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles.

Miscellaneous income, net increased in 2006 compared with 2005 due to a 2006 fourth quarter business interruption insurance claim recovery from hurricane related losses of $3 million ($2 million within our FMS business segment and $1 million within our DCC business segment), a one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies and better market performance of investments classified as trading securities. These favorable comparisons were partially offset by a $1 million charge in 2006 related to the settlement of litigation associated with a discontinued operation, as well as the one time recovery in the first quarter of 2005 of $3 million of project costs incurred in prior years. Miscellaneous income, net increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to the previously mentioned one time recovery for project costs incurred in prior years and better market performance of investments classified as trading securities. Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges (recoveries), net $ 3,564 3,376 (17,676 ) 2006 Activity During 2006, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other charges of $4 million that primarily consisted of early debt retirement costs and employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) These charges were partially offset by adjustments to prior year severance and employee related accruals and facility charges. We expect to realize annual pre tax cost savings of approximately $8 million from the 2006 fourth quarter measures once all employee severance actions have been completed. As part of ongoing cost management actions, Ryder incurred $2 million in costs in the fourth quarter to extinguish high interest paying debentures that were originally set to mature in 2016. The total debt retirement costs consisted of the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of the related debt discount and issuance costs. We expect to realize annual pre tax interest savings over the next 4 years of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of this debenture. In the fourth quarter, Ryder also approved a plan to eliminate approximately 150 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions throughout Ryders domestic and international business segments and Central Support Services (CSS). The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million. Although some of these actions were completed as of December 31, 2006, transition plans for eliminating some of the positions will be communicated in the beginning of 2007. Cost reductions associated with the actions that have been completed as of December 31, 2006 will benefit salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2007. Cost reductions associated with the elimination of the other positions will benefit salaries and employee related costs in the latter part of 2007. During 2006 we also had employee related accruals and facility charges recorded in prior restructuring charges that were adjusted due to subsequent refinements in estimates. 2005 Activity During 2005, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other charges of $3 million that consisted of employee severance and benefits, contract termination costs, and closure of leased facilities partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter and related primarily to the restructuring of our U.K. operations, and the offshoring of some administrative finance and support functions that will allow for future cost savings. By December 31, 2006, the 2005 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs in the latter half of 2006. During 2005, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 160 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in Ryders domestic and international FMS and SCS business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $3 million. Cost reductions associated with these actions benefited salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Many of the eliminated positions in our domestic operations were impacted by the decision to outsource certain administrative finance functions to lower cost foreign providers and maximize our technology resources. Transition actions began in February 2006 and continued through the remainder of 2006. We also closed two administrative offices in the U.S. as a result of the restructuring of our FMS domestic business operations and recorded a charge for future cash payments related to lease obligations. Also in 2005, management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced telecommunication services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the outsourcing agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 2010. In accordance with the terms of this service agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling nearly $1 million for contract termination costs. In 2006, the transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses in the latter part of 2006. These charges were partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals due to refinements in estimates. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2004 Activity During 2004, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other recoveries of $18 million that consisted of gains from the sale of the previous headquarters complex and reversals of severance and employee related accruals partially offset by contract termination costs. During 2004, we recognized $24 million in gains from properties sold in connection with the relocation of our headquarters. In May 2004, we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters facility for $39 million in cash and recognized a $22 million gain from the sale. In conjunction with this sale, we entered into a lease agreement with the purchaser to lease back the headquarters facility until we relocated to our new headquarters in April 2005. Also during 2004, we recognized gains totaling $2 million from the sale of properties ancillary to our main headquarters facility. In 2004, as part of ongoing cost containment initiatives, Ryder management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced information technology infrastructure services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the outsourcing agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 2010. In accordance with the terms of the services agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling $8 million for contract termination ($6 million) and transition costs incurred since termination ($2 million). By December 31, 2004, all transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses starting in 2005.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As part of managements evaluation of segment operating performance, we define the primary measurement of our segment financial performance as Net Before Tax (NBT), which includes an allocation of CSS and excludes restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net and 2006 net retirement plan charges. The following table provides a reconciliation of items excluded from our segment NBT measure to their classification within our Consolidated Statements of Earnings: Consolidated Years ended December 31 Statements of Earnings Description Line Item(1) 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Severance and employee related (costs) recoveries Restructuring $ (1,048 ) (2,449 ) 1,216 Facilities and related (costs) recoveries Restructuring (194 ) (181 ) 79 Early retirement of debt Restructuring (2,141 ) Contract termination and transition costs Restructuring (181 ) (746 ) (8,000 ) Gain on sale of headquarter complex Restructuring 24,308 Other Restructuring 73 Restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net (3,564 ) (3,376 ) 17,676 Pension accounting charge(2) Salaries (5,872 ) Pension remeasurement benefit(2) Salaries 4,667 Postretirement benefit plan charge(2) Salaries (1,842 ) 2006 net retirement plan (charges) (3,047 ) Restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net and 2006 net retirement plan charges $ (6,611 ) (3,376 ) 17,676 (1) Restructuring refers to the Restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net and Salaries refers to Salaries and employee related costs on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. (2) See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all of our business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each of our business segments and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, corporate communications, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue grew in 2006 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue increased in 2006 due to full service lease growth primarily in North America. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.3%. Contractual revenue growth in 2006 was realized in both FMS product lines. Full service lease revenue grew in 2006 due to higher lease rates and higher levels of sales activity in North America. Contract maintenance revenue increased in 2006 due primarily to new sales activity. In 2007, we expect each of our contractual product lines to demonstrate revenue growth based on 2006 sales activity levels and ongoing investments in new sales and business retention initiatives. Commercial rental revenue decreased in 2006 reflecting a smaller average fleet and lower vehicle utilization from a weakening 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) U.S. commercial rental market. In the fourth quarter of 2006, commercial rental revenue decreased 7% reflecting lower vehicle utilization and pricing. We expect similar unfavorable commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue in 2007; however, we expect percentage revenue declines to be greater in the first half of 2007 and improve in the second half of 2007. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Change Years ended December 31 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 282,528 296,435 292,241 (5 )% 1 Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 277,461 284,187 257,828 (2 )% 10 Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 33,400 34,400 34,700 (3 )% (1 ) Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 24,600 24,700 24,000 % 3 Commercial rental utilization 71.9% 74.6% 76.9% (270 )bps (230 )bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT grew $14 million during 2006 primarily as a result of revenue growth in our full service lease and contract maintenance product lines. The favorable impact of contractual revenue growth was partially offset by reduced commercial rental volumes, higher sales and marketing expenses, compensation related expenses and higher interest expense due primarily to planned higher debt levels to support investments in the full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. 2005 versus 2004 Total revenue grew in 2005 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue for 2005 increased as a result of higher commercial rental and contract related maintenance revenue and the impact of acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $21 million of total additional revenue in 2005. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2005 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.6%. Contractual revenue growth in 2005 was driven by growth in the full service lease product line and was slightly offset by contract maintenance revenue declines. Full service lease revenue increased in 2005 primarily from the acquisition completed in March 2004 and growth in Canada as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) in the first half of 2005. Our U.S. business showed improved revenue growth trends in the second half of 2005 as a result of positive net sales. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue, which generally represents ancillary services supporting core product lines, benefited from ongoing initiatives aimed at growing these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of stronger pricing and revenue contribution attributed to the acquisition completed in March 2004. During 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the fourth quarter of 2005, we also restructured our FMS operations to better service customers and drive future growth in full service lease. FMS NBT grew $42 million in 2005 as a result of improved commercial rental results from higher pricing, higher gains on disposal of used vehicles resulting from stronger volume and pricing, and lower overhead costs, including performance based incentive compensation. Our global fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment and contract maintenance vehicles is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2006 2005 2004 2006/ 2005/ 2005 2004 End of period vehicle count By type: Trucks 65,200 63,200 63,700 3 % (1 ) Tractors 56,100 52,700 51,700 6 2 Trailers 38,900 40,600 43,100 (4 ) (6 ) Other 5,700 5,800 5,900 (2 ) (2 ) Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) By ownership: Owned 160,800 156,500 157,000 3 % Leased 5,100 5,800 7,400 (12 ) (22 ) Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) By product line: Full service lease 117,500 113,700 115,300 3 % (1 ) Commercial rental 37,000 38,400 40,200 (4 ) (4 ) Service vehicles and other 3,500 3,300 3,000 6 10 Active units 158,000 155,400 158,500 2 (2 ) Held for sale(1) 7,900 6,900 5,900 14 17 Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 30,700 26,400 28,500 16 % (7 ) Year to date average vehicle count By product line: Full service lease 114,600 114,400 115,900 % (1 ) Commercial rental 38,700 40,200 39,900 (4 ) 1 Service vehicles and other 3,300 3,300 2,900 14 Active units 156,600 157,900 158,700 (1 ) (1 ) Held for sale(1) 6,700 7,000 5,600 (4 ) 25 Total 163,300 164,900 164,300 (1 )% Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 28,000 27,400 30,100 2 % (9 ) (1) Vehicles held for sale represent all units available for sale including units held for sale reported in the following table for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days (referred to as NLE units).

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The totals in the table above include the following non revenue earning equipment for the U.S. fleet (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ Number of Units 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 4,200 1,700 1,900 147 % (11 ) No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale 6,600 5,500 4,800 20 15 Other NLE units 1,900 1,400 1,600 36 (13 ) Total(1) 12,700 8,600 8,300 48 % 4 (1) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,700 in 2006 and 1,500 vehicles in 2005 and 2004, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. In 2006, the number of NYE units increased due to the volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2006 and 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to higher out servicing of rental units as well as the impact of increased lease replacement activity. We expect the number of NLE units to increase in the near term based on continuing lease replacement activity and planned out servicing of rental vehicles.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2006, GM accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect favorable revenue comparisons to continue over the near term. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups and better margins in our Brazil operations. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a $3 million benefit, net of variable compensation, related to a contract termination. 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was due primarily to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. In 2005, GM accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of 2005. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006 as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. Despite declining revenue growth trends in the second half of 2006, we expect favorable revenue comparisons in 2007 based on planned investments in sales and marketing initiatives. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs, including a hurricane related recovery. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 2005 versus 2004 Total CSS costs declined in 2005 due primarily to cost benefits associated with the insourcing and renegotiation of several information technology infrastructure services and lower performance based incentive compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarter facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarter relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Financing activities 488,202 241,505 (195,760 ) Investing activities (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) (720,113 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (2,327 ) (3,956 ) 9,368 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (88 ) 27,756 (39,656 ) 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, due primarily to higher earnings (adjusted for non cash items) and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Cash provided by financing activities for 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher vehicle capital spending. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. We manage our business to maximize net cash provided by operating activities (operating cash flows) and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,079 326,752 288,674 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,575 6,963 42,839 Collections on direct finance leases 66,274 70,408 63,795 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 Other, net 2,163 512 Total cash generated 1,254,678 1,183,185 1,381,202 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) Acquisitions (4,113 ) (15,110 ) (148,791 ) Free cash flow $ (444,499 ) (231,304 ) 140,253 We used $444 million of free cash flow compared to a use of $231 million in 2005 due to increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We used $231 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $140 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially offset by lower acquisition spending. We anticipate free cash flow levels to improve in 2007 as a result of lower anticipated vehicle capital spending. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,492,720 1,082,332 862,994 Commercial rental 195,023 251,278 241,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 1,104,852 Operating property and equipment 71,772 77,360 59,767 Total capital expenditures 1,759,515 1,410,970 1,164,619 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (64,451 ) (11,591 ) (72,461 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,695,064 1,399,379 1,092,158 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $0.4 million and $54 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital expenditures grew in 2006 and 2005 due to increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after market devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $1.33 billion in 2007 as a result of reduced replacement activity and lower planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2007 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $4 million in 2006, $15 million in 2005 and $149 million in 2004. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2007. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 328,641 188,271 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 600,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 120,568 162,124 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (213,195 ) (200,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (165,324 ) (343,933 ) 620,690 406,462 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (663 ) (4,152 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 2,295 433 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 9,255 (593 ) Total changes in debt 631,577 402,150 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2006, compared with 32% at December 31, 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2006 Equity 2005 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,816,943 164% $ 2,185,366 143 % Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 77,998 117,062 Total obligations $ 2,894,941 168% $ 2,302,428 151 % (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2006 was driven by our increased capital spending required to support our contractual full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A significant downgrade of Ryders debt rating would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2006). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. Throughout 2006, we were in compliance with this and all other restrictive covenants for our revolving credit facility and do not expect the covenants to significantly affect our operations. The ratio at December 31, 2006 was 146%. At December 31, 2006, $113 million was available under the credit facility. During 1986, we issued at a discount $100 million principal amount of unsecured debentures due May 2016, with a stated interest rate of 9.0%, payable semi annually. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we retired $63 million principal amount of these debentures at a premium, which resulted in a charge of $2 million. The charge represents the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. During 2006, we issued $550 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, Ryder filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that was carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had $250 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs that would cause early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 11, 2007. At December 31, 2006, there were no receivables outstanding under the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 113 Shelf registration statement 250 Trade receivables facility 200 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables facility will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. In connection with these leases we have provided limited guarantees of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions during 2004 that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We have not entered into any sale leaseback transactions since 2004. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. In October 2006, Ryder entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of its independent directors. The terms of the indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that to the extent permitted by Florida law, Ryder will indemnify such director acting in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Ryder, against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $17 million and $16 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million and $3 million, respectively, as a corresponding liability.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 332,124 269,720 1,468,587 743,003 2,813,434 Capital lease obligations 621 1,109 474 1,305 3,509 Total debt 332,745 270,829 1,469,061 744,308 2,816,943 Interest on debt(1) 139,648 245,390 138,172 262,139 785,349 Operating leases(2) 108,878 128,425 85,637 47,034 369,974 Purchase obligations(3) 340,427 41,850 4,350 386,627 Total contractual cash obligations 588,953 415,665 228,159 309,173 1,541,950 Insurance obligations(4) 117,311 113,414 47,754 29,930 308,409 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 24,831 3,667 2,010 48,591 79,099 Total $ 1,063,840 803,575 1,746,984 1,132,002 4,746,401 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2006. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations, deferred compensation obligations and derivative contracts. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2007, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $58 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2007 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $56 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Information At December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated net equity charge (after tax) of $201 million compared to $221 million as of December 31, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record a charge related to the unrecognized net actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition asset. The after tax equity charge of $201 million includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 which increased the equity charge by $151 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the equity charge of $178 million, prior to the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158, was principally the 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) result of fully funding accumulated benefit obligations of our primary pension plan. The improved funding levels resulted from strong investment returns on pension plan assets, global pension contributions during 2006, and a reduction in pension obligations as a result of a higher interest rate environment. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 14% in 2006. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2006, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $130 million compared with $12 million in 2005. After considering the 2006 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $56 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute will take effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will have on future pension funding requirements. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plan effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and will participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that meet the grandfathering criteria will be given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plan or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan is being replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plan. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the May 2006 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since March 1, 2006. The May 2006 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the May 2006 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. At December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.8 million shares under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $93 million. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the October 2005 program. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since May 1, 2004. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions, and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the July 2004 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. In October 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a $90 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Under the October 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the October 2003 program. In 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, under the October 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $44 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004. During 2006, we increased our annual dividend to $0.72 per share of common stock. In February 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.03 increase from the $0.18 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2006. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of the interest 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex to comparable earnings from continuing 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease. The increase in equipment rental in 2006 compared with 2005 reflects the impact of higher rental costs associated with investments made in material handling equipment to support the growth in our SCS business, which more than offset the decline in vehicle related rental expense from a smaller average lease count. The decrease in equipment rental in 2005 compared to 2004 was due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles.

Interest expense grew in 2005 reflecting higher average debt levels, resulting from increased capital spending, income tax payments and share repurchases.

Miscellaneous income, net increased in 2006 compared with 2005 due to a 2006 fourth quarter business interruption insurance claim recovery from hurricane related losses of $3 million ($2 million within our FMS business segment and $1 million within our DCC business segment), a one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies and better market performance of investments classified as trading securities. These favorable comparisons were partially offset by a $1 million charge in 2006 related to the settlement of litigation associated with a discontinued operation, as well as the one time recovery in the first quarter of 2005 of $3 million of project costs incurred in prior years. Miscellaneous income, net increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to the previously mentioned one time recovery for project costs incurred in prior years and better market performance of investments classified as trading securities. Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges (recoveries), net $ 3,564 3,376 (17,676 ) 2006 Activity During 2006, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other charges of $4 million that primarily consisted of early debt retirement costs and employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) These charges were partially offset by adjustments to prior year severance and employee related accruals and facility charges. We expect to realize annual pre tax cost savings of approximately $8 million from the 2006 fourth quarter measures once all employee severance actions have been completed. As part of ongoing cost management actions, Ryder incurred $2 million in costs in the fourth quarter to extinguish high interest paying debentures that were originally set to mature in 2016. The total debt retirement costs consisted of the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of the related debt discount and issuance costs. We expect to realize annual pre tax interest savings over the next 4 years of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of this debenture. In the fourth quarter, Ryder also approved a plan to eliminate approximately 150 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions throughout Ryders domestic and international business segments and Central Support Services (CSS). The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million. Although some of these actions were completed as of December 31, 2006, transition plans for eliminating some of the positions will be communicated in the beginning of 2007. Cost reductions associated with the actions that have been completed as of December 31, 2006 will benefit salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2007. Cost reductions associated with the elimination of the other positions will benefit salaries and employee related costs in the latter part of 2007. During 2006 we also had employee related accruals and facility charges recorded in prior restructuring charges that were adjusted due to subsequent refinements in estimates. 2005 Activity During 2005, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other charges of $3 million that consisted of employee severance and benefits, contract termination costs, and closure of leased facilities partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter and related primarily to the restructuring of our U.K. operations, and the offshoring of some administrative finance and support functions that will allow for future cost savings. By December 31, 2006, the 2005 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs in the latter half of 2006. During 2005, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 160 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in Ryders domestic and international FMS and SCS business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $3 million. Cost reductions associated with these actions benefited salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Many of the eliminated positions in our domestic operations were impacted by the decision to outsource certain administrative finance functions to lower cost foreign providers and maximize our technology resources. Transition actions began in February 2006 and continued through the remainder of 2006. We also closed two administrative offices in the U.S. as a result of the restructuring of our FMS domestic business operations and recorded a charge for future cash payments related to lease obligations. Also in 2005, management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced telecommunication services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the outsourcing agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 2010. In accordance with the terms of this service agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling nearly $1 million for contract termination costs. In 2006, the transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses in the latter part of 2006. These charges were partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals due to refinements in estimates. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2004 Activity During 2004, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other recoveries of $18 million that consisted of gains from the sale of the previous headquarters complex and reversals of severance and employee related accruals partially offset by contract termination costs. During 2004, we recognized $24 million in gains from properties sold in connection with the relocation of our headquarters. In May 2004, we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters facility for $39 million in cash and recognized a $22 million gain from the sale. In conjunction with this sale, we entered into a lease agreement with the purchaser to lease back the headquarters facility until we relocated to our new headquarters in April 2005. Also during 2004, we recognized gains totaling $2 million from the sale of properties ancillary to our main headquarters facility. In 2004, as part of ongoing cost containment initiatives, Ryder management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced information technology infrastructure services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the outsourcing agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 2010. In accordance with the terms of the services agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling $8 million for contract termination ($6 million) and transition costs incurred since termination ($2 million). By December 31, 2004, all transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses starting in 2005.

The 2005 effective tax rate includes a tax benefit of $8 million associated with the State of Ohio enacted tax legislation, which phases out the Ohio corporate franchise tax and phases in a new gross receipts tax called the Commercial Activity Tax (CAT) over a five year period. The 2004 effective tax rate includes a net tax benefit of $9 million associated with the completion of the audit of our federal income tax returns for the 1995 to 1997 period, partially offset by provisions made for loss contingencies related to the 1998 through 2000 period.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As part of managements evaluation of segment operating performance, we define the primary measurement of our segment financial performance as Net Before Tax (NBT), which includes an allocation of CSS and excludes restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net and 2006 net retirement plan charges. The following table provides a reconciliation of items excluded from our segment NBT measure to their classification within our Consolidated Statements of Earnings: Consolidated Years ended December 31 Statements of Earnings Description Line Item(1) 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Severance and employee related (costs) recoveries Restructuring $ (1,048 ) (2,449 ) 1,216 Facilities and related (costs) recoveries Restructuring (194 ) (181 ) 79 Early retirement of debt Restructuring (2,141 ) Contract termination and transition costs Restructuring (181 ) (746 ) (8,000 ) Gain on sale of headquarter complex Restructuring 24,308 Other Restructuring 73 Restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net (3,564 ) (3,376 ) 17,676 Pension accounting charge(2) Salaries (5,872 ) Pension remeasurement benefit(2) Salaries 4,667 Postretirement benefit plan charge(2) Salaries (1,842 ) 2006 net retirement plan (charges) (3,047 ) Restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net and 2006 net retirement plan charges $ (6,611 ) (3,376 ) 17,676 (1) Restructuring refers to the Restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net and Salaries refers to Salaries and employee related costs on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. (2) See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all of our business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each of our business segments and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, corporate communications, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue grew in 2006 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue increased in 2006 due to full service lease growth primarily in North America. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.3%. Contractual revenue growth in 2006 was realized in both FMS product lines. Full service lease revenue grew in 2006 due to higher lease rates and higher levels of sales activity in North America. Contract maintenance revenue increased in 2006 due primarily to new sales activity. In 2007, we expect each of our contractual product lines to demonstrate revenue growth based on 2006 sales activity levels and ongoing investments in new sales and business retention initiatives. Commercial rental revenue decreased in 2006 reflecting a smaller average fleet and lower vehicle utilization from a weakening 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) U.S. commercial rental market. In the fourth quarter of 2006, commercial rental revenue decreased 7% reflecting lower vehicle utilization and pricing. We expect similar unfavorable commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue in 2007; however, we expect percentage revenue declines to be greater in the first half of 2007 and improve in the second half of 2007. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Change Years ended December 31 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 282,528 296,435 292,241 (5 )% 1 Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 277,461 284,187 257,828 (2 )% 10 Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 33,400 34,400 34,700 (3 )% (1 ) Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 24,600 24,700 24,000 % 3 Commercial rental utilization 71.9% 74.6% 76.9% (270 )bps (230 )bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT grew $14 million during 2006 primarily as a result of revenue growth in our full service lease and contract maintenance product lines. The favorable impact of contractual revenue growth was partially offset by reduced commercial rental volumes, higher sales and marketing expenses, compensation related expenses and higher interest expense due primarily to planned higher debt levels to support investments in the full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. 2005 versus 2004 Total revenue grew in 2005 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue for 2005 increased as a result of higher commercial rental and contract related maintenance revenue and the impact of acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $21 million of total additional revenue in 2005. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2005 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.6%. Contractual revenue growth in 2005 was driven by growth in the full service lease product line and was slightly offset by contract maintenance revenue declines. Full service lease revenue increased in 2005 primarily from the acquisition completed in March 2004 and growth in Canada as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) in the first half of 2005. Our U.S. business showed improved revenue growth trends in the second half of 2005 as a result of positive net sales. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue, which generally represents ancillary services supporting core product lines, benefited from ongoing initiatives aimed at growing these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of stronger pricing and revenue contribution attributed to the acquisition completed in March 2004. During 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the fourth quarter of 2005, we also restructured our FMS operations to better service customers and drive future growth in full service lease. FMS NBT grew $42 million in 2005 as a result of improved commercial rental results from higher pricing, higher gains on disposal of used vehicles resulting from stronger volume and pricing, and lower overhead costs, including performance based incentive compensation. Our global fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment and contract maintenance vehicles is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2006 2005 2004 2006/ 2005/ 2005 2004 End of period vehicle count By type: Trucks 65,200 63,200 63,700 3 % (1 ) Tractors 56,100 52,700 51,700 6 2 Trailers 38,900 40,600 43,100 (4 ) (6 ) Other 5,700 5,800 5,900 (2 ) (2 ) Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) By ownership: Owned 160,800 156,500 157,000 3 % Leased 5,100 5,800 7,400 (12 ) (22 ) Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) By product line: Full service lease 117,500 113,700 115,300 3 % (1 ) Commercial rental 37,000 38,400 40,200 (4 ) (4 ) Service vehicles and other 3,500 3,300 3,000 6 10 Active units 158,000 155,400 158,500 2 (2 ) Held for sale(1) 7,900 6,900 5,900 14 17 Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 30,700 26,400 28,500 16 % (7 ) Year to date average vehicle count By product line: Full service lease 114,600 114,400 115,900 % (1 ) Commercial rental 38,700 40,200 39,900 (4 ) 1 Service vehicles and other 3,300 3,300 2,900 14 Active units 156,600 157,900 158,700 (1 ) (1 ) Held for sale(1) 6,700 7,000 5,600 (4 ) 25 Total 163,300 164,900 164,300 (1 )% Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 28,000 27,400 30,100 2 % (9 ) (1) Vehicles held for sale represent all units available for sale including units held for sale reported in the following table for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days (referred to as NLE units).

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The totals in the table above include the following non revenue earning equipment for the U.S. fleet (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ Number of Units 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 4,200 1,700 1,900 147 % (11 ) No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale 6,600 5,500 4,800 20 15 Other NLE units 1,900 1,400 1,600 36 (13 ) Total(1) 12,700 8,600 8,300 48 % 4 (1) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,700 in 2006 and 1,500 vehicles in 2005 and 2004, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. In 2006, the number of NYE units increased due to the volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2006 and 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to higher out servicing of rental units as well as the impact of increased lease replacement activity. We expect the number of NLE units to increase in the near term based on continuing lease replacement activity and planned out servicing of rental vehicles.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2006, GM accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect favorable revenue comparisons to continue over the near term. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups and better margins in our Brazil operations. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a $3 million benefit, net of variable compensation, related to a contract termination. 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was due primarily to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. In 2005, GM accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of 2005. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006 as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. Despite declining revenue growth trends in the second half of 2006, we expect favorable revenue comparisons in 2007 based on planned investments in sales and marketing initiatives. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs, including a hurricane related recovery. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 2005 versus 2004 Total CSS costs declined in 2005 due primarily to cost benefits associated with the insourcing and renegotiation of several information technology infrastructure services and lower performance based incentive compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarter facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarter relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Financing activities 488,202 241,505 (195,760 ) Investing activities (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) (720,113 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (2,327 ) (3,956 ) 9,368 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (88 ) 27,756 (39,656 ) 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, due primarily to higher earnings (adjusted for non cash items) and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Cash provided by financing activities for 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher vehicle capital spending. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. We manage our business to maximize net cash provided by operating activities (operating cash flows) and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,079 326,752 288,674 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,575 6,963 42,839 Collections on direct finance leases 66,274 70,408 63,795 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 Other, net 2,163 512 Total cash generated 1,254,678 1,183,185 1,381,202 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) Acquisitions (4,113 ) (15,110 ) (148,791 ) Free cash flow $ (444,499 ) (231,304 ) 140,253 We used $444 million of free cash flow compared to a use of $231 million in 2005 due to increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We used $231 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $140 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially offset by lower acquisition spending. We anticipate free cash flow levels to improve in 2007 as a result of lower anticipated vehicle capital spending. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,492,720 1,082,332 862,994 Commercial rental 195,023 251,278 241,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 1,104,852 Operating property and equipment 71,772 77,360 59,767 Total capital expenditures 1,759,515 1,410,970 1,164,619 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (64,451 ) (11,591 ) (72,461 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,695,064 1,399,379 1,092,158 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $0.4 million and $54 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital expenditures grew in 2006 and 2005 due to increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after market devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $1.33 billion in 2007 as a result of reduced replacement activity and lower planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2007 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $4 million in 2006, $15 million in 2005 and $149 million in 2004. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2007. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 328,641 188,271 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 600,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 120,568 162,124 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (213,195 ) (200,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (165,324 ) (343,933 ) 620,690 406,462 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (663 ) (4,152 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 2,295 433 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 9,255 (593 ) Total changes in debt 631,577 402,150 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2006, compared with 32% at December 31, 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2006 Equity 2005 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,816,943 164% $ 2,185,366 143 % Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 77,998 117,062 Total obligations $ 2,894,941 168% $ 2,302,428 151 % (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2006 was driven by our increased capital spending required to support our contractual full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A significant downgrade of Ryders debt rating would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2006). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. Throughout 2006, we were in compliance with this and all other restrictive covenants for our revolving credit facility and do not expect the covenants to significantly affect our operations. The ratio at December 31, 2006 was 146%. At December 31, 2006, $113 million was available under the credit facility. During 1986, we issued at a discount $100 million principal amount of unsecured debentures due May 2016, with a stated interest rate of 9.0%, payable semi annually. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we retired $63 million principal amount of these debentures at a premium, which resulted in a charge of $2 million. The charge represents the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. During 2006, we issued $550 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, Ryder filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that was carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had $250 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs that would cause early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 11, 2007. At December 31, 2006, there were no receivables outstanding under the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 113 Shelf registration statement 250 Trade receivables facility 200 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables facility will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. In connection with these leases we have provided limited guarantees of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions during 2004 that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We have not entered into any sale leaseback transactions since 2004. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. In October 2006, Ryder entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of its independent directors. The terms of the indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that to the extent permitted by Florida law, Ryder will indemnify such director acting in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Ryder, against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $17 million and $16 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million and $3 million, respectively, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 332,124 269,720 1,468,587 743,003 2,813,434 Capital lease obligations 621 1,109 474 1,305 3,509 Total debt 332,745 270,829 1,469,061 744,308 2,816,943 Interest on debt(1) 139,648 245,390 138,172 262,139 785,349 Operating leases(2) 108,878 128,425 85,637 47,034 369,974 Purchase obligations(3) 340,427 41,850 4,350 386,627 Total contractual cash obligations 588,953 415,665 228,159 309,173 1,541,950 Insurance obligations(4) 117,311 113,414 47,754 29,930 308,409 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 24,831 3,667 2,010 48,591 79,099 Total $ 1,063,840 803,575 1,746,984 1,132,002 4,746,401 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2006. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations, deferred compensation obligations and derivative contracts. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2007, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $58 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2007 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $56 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Information At December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated net equity charge (after tax) of $201 million compared to $221 million as of December 31, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record a charge related to the unrecognized net actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition asset. The after tax equity charge of $201 million includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 which increased the equity charge by $151 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the equity charge of $178 million, prior to the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158, was principally the 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) result of fully funding accumulated benefit obligations of our primary pension plan. The improved funding levels resulted from strong investment returns on pension plan assets, global pension contributions during 2006, and a reduction in pension obligations as a result of a higher interest rate environment. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 14% in 2006. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2006, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $130 million compared with $12 million in 2005. After considering the 2006 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $56 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute will take effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will have on future pension funding requirements. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plan effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and will participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that meet the grandfathering criteria will be given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plan or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan is being replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plan. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the May 2006 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since March 1, 2006. The May 2006 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the May 2006 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. At December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.8 million shares under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $93 million. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the October 2005 program. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since May 1, 2004. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions, and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the July 2004 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. In October 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a $90 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Under the October 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the October 2003 program. In 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, under the October 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $44 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004. During 2006, we increased our annual dividend to $0.72 per share of common stock. In February 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.03 increase from the $0.18 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2006. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of the interest 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex to comparable earnings from continuing 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) These charges were partially offset by adjustments to prior year severance and employee related accruals and facility charges. We expect to realize annual pre tax cost savings of approximately $8 million from the 2006 fourth quarter measures once all employee severance actions have been completed. As part of ongoing cost management actions, Ryder incurred $2 million in costs in the fourth quarter to extinguish high interest paying debentures that were originally set to mature in 2016. The total debt retirement costs consisted of the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of the related debt discount and issuance costs. We expect to realize annual pre tax interest savings over the next 4 years of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of this debenture. In the fourth quarter, Ryder also approved a plan to eliminate approximately 150 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions throughout Ryders domestic and international business segments and Central Support Services (CSS). The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million. Although some of these actions were completed as of December 31, 2006, transition plans for eliminating some of the positions will be communicated in the beginning of 2007. Cost reductions associated with the actions that have been completed as of December 31, 2006 will benefit salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2007. Cost reductions associated with the elimination of the other positions will benefit salaries and employee related costs in the latter part of 2007. During 2006 we also had employee related accruals and facility charges recorded in prior restructuring charges that were adjusted due to subsequent refinements in estimates. 2005 Activity During 2005, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other charges of $3 million that consisted of employee severance and benefits, contract termination costs, and closure of leased facilities partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter and related primarily to the restructuring of our U.K. operations, and the offshoring of some administrative finance and support functions that will allow for future cost savings. By December 31, 2006, the 2005 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs in the latter half of 2006. During 2005, Ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately 160 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in Ryders domestic and international FMS and SCS business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $3 million. Cost reductions associated with these actions benefited salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Many of the eliminated positions in our domestic operations were impacted by the decision to outsource certain administrative finance functions to lower cost foreign providers and maximize our technology resources. Transition actions began in February 2006 and continued through the remainder of 2006. We also closed two administrative offices in the U.S. as a result of the restructuring of our FMS domestic business operations and recorded a charge for future cash payments related to lease obligations. Also in 2005, management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced telecommunication services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the outsourcing agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 2010. In accordance with the terms of this service agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling nearly $1 million for contract termination costs. In 2006, the transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses in the latter part of 2006. These charges were partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals due to refinements in estimates. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2004 Activity During 2004, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other recoveries of $18 million that consisted of gains from the sale of the previous headquarters complex and reversals of severance and employee related accruals partially offset by contract termination costs. During 2004, we recognized $24 million in gains from properties sold in connection with the relocation of our headquarters. In May 2004, we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters facility for $39 million in cash and recognized a $22 million gain from the sale. In conjunction with this sale, we entered into a lease agreement with the purchaser to lease back the headquarters facility until we relocated to our new headquarters in April 2005. Also during 2004, we recognized gains totaling $2 million from the sale of properties ancillary to our main headquarters facility. In 2004, as part of ongoing cost containment initiatives, Ryder management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced information technology infrastructure services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the outsourcing agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 2010. In accordance with the terms of the services agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling $8 million for contract termination ($6 million) and transition costs incurred since termination ($2 million). By December 31, 2004, all transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses starting in 2005.

(2) See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all of our business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each of our business segments and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, corporate communications, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue grew in 2006 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue increased in 2006 due to full service lease growth primarily in North America. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.3%. Contractual revenue growth in 2006 was realized in both FMS product lines. Full service lease revenue grew in 2006 due to higher lease rates and higher levels of sales activity in North America. Contract maintenance revenue increased in 2006 due primarily to new sales activity. In 2007, we expect each of our contractual product lines to demonstrate revenue growth based on 2006 sales activity levels and ongoing investments in new sales and business retention initiatives. Commercial rental revenue decreased in 2006 reflecting a smaller average fleet and lower vehicle utilization from a weakening 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) U.S. commercial rental market. In the fourth quarter of 2006, commercial rental revenue decreased 7% reflecting lower vehicle utilization and pricing. We expect similar unfavorable commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue in 2007; however, we expect percentage revenue declines to be greater in the first half of 2007 and improve in the second half of 2007. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Change Years ended December 31 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 282,528 296,435 292,241 (5 )% 1 Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 277,461 284,187 257,828 (2 )% 10 Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 33,400 34,400 34,700 (3 )% (1 ) Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 24,600 24,700 24,000 % 3 Commercial rental utilization 71.9% 74.6% 76.9% (270 )bps (230 )bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT grew $14 million during 2006 primarily as a result of revenue growth in our full service lease and contract maintenance product lines. The favorable impact of contractual revenue growth was partially offset by reduced commercial rental volumes, higher sales and marketing expenses, compensation related expenses and higher interest expense due primarily to planned higher debt levels to support investments in the full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. 2005 versus 2004 Total revenue grew in 2005 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue for 2005 increased as a result of higher commercial rental and contract related maintenance revenue and the impact of acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $21 million of total additional revenue in 2005. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2005 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.6%. Contractual revenue growth in 2005 was driven by growth in the full service lease product line and was slightly offset by contract maintenance revenue declines. Full service lease revenue increased in 2005 primarily from the acquisition completed in March 2004 and growth in Canada as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) in the first half of 2005. Our U.S. business showed improved revenue growth trends in the second half of 2005 as a result of positive net sales. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue, which generally represents ancillary services supporting core product lines, benefited from ongoing initiatives aimed at growing these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of stronger pricing and revenue contribution attributed to the acquisition completed in March 2004. During 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the fourth quarter of 2005, we also restructured our FMS operations to better service customers and drive future growth in full service lease. FMS NBT grew $42 million in 2005 as a result of improved commercial rental results from higher pricing, higher gains on disposal of used vehicles resulting from stronger volume and pricing, and lower overhead costs, including performance based incentive compensation. Our global fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment and contract maintenance vehicles is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2006 2005 2004 2006/ 2005/ 2005 2004 End of period vehicle count By type: Trucks 65,200 63,200 63,700 3 % (1 ) Tractors 56,100 52,700 51,700 6 2 Trailers 38,900 40,600 43,100 (4 ) (6 ) Other 5,700 5,800 5,900 (2 ) (2 ) Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) By ownership: Owned 160,800 156,500 157,000 3 % Leased 5,100 5,800 7,400 (12 ) (22 ) Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) By product line: Full service lease 117,500 113,700 115,300 3 % (1 ) Commercial rental 37,000 38,400 40,200 (4 ) (4 ) Service vehicles and other 3,500 3,300 3,000 6 10 Active units 158,000 155,400 158,500 2 (2 ) Held for sale(1) 7,900 6,900 5,900 14 17 Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 30,700 26,400 28,500 16 % (7 ) Year to date average vehicle count By product line: Full service lease 114,600 114,400 115,900 % (1 ) Commercial rental 38,700 40,200 39,900 (4 ) 1 Service vehicles and other 3,300 3,300 2,900 14 Active units 156,600 157,900 158,700 (1 ) (1 ) Held for sale(1) 6,700 7,000 5,600 (4 ) 25 Total 163,300 164,900 164,300 (1 )% Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 28,000 27,400 30,100 2 % (9 ) (1) Vehicles held for sale represent all units available for sale including units held for sale reported in the following table for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days (referred to as NLE units).

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The totals in the table above include the following non revenue earning equipment for the U.S. fleet (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ Number of Units 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 4,200 1,700 1,900 147 % (11 ) No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale 6,600 5,500 4,800 20 15 Other NLE units 1,900 1,400 1,600 36 (13 ) Total(1) 12,700 8,600 8,300 48 % 4 (1) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,700 in 2006 and 1,500 vehicles in 2005 and 2004, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. In 2006, the number of NYE units increased due to the volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2006 and 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to higher out servicing of rental units as well as the impact of increased lease replacement activity. We expect the number of NLE units to increase in the near term based on continuing lease replacement activity and planned out servicing of rental vehicles.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2006, GM accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect favorable revenue comparisons to continue over the near term. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups and better margins in our Brazil operations. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a $3 million benefit, net of variable compensation, related to a contract termination. 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was due primarily to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. In 2005, GM accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of 2005. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006 as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. Despite declining revenue growth trends in the second half of 2006, we expect favorable revenue comparisons in 2007 based on planned investments in sales and marketing initiatives. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs, including a hurricane related recovery. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 2005 versus 2004 Total CSS costs declined in 2005 due primarily to cost benefits associated with the insourcing and renegotiation of several information technology infrastructure services and lower performance based incentive compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarter facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarter relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Financing activities 488,202 241,505 (195,760 ) Investing activities (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) (720,113 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (2,327 ) (3,956 ) 9,368 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (88 ) 27,756 (39,656 ) 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, due primarily to higher earnings (adjusted for non cash items) and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Cash provided by financing activities for 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher vehicle capital spending. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. We manage our business to maximize net cash provided by operating activities (operating cash flows) and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,079 326,752 288,674 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,575 6,963 42,839 Collections on direct finance leases 66,274 70,408 63,795 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 Other, net 2,163 512 Total cash generated 1,254,678 1,183,185 1,381,202 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) Acquisitions (4,113 ) (15,110 ) (148,791 ) Free cash flow $ (444,499 ) (231,304 ) 140,253 We used $444 million of free cash flow compared to a use of $231 million in 2005 due to increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We used $231 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $140 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially offset by lower acquisition spending. We anticipate free cash flow levels to improve in 2007 as a result of lower anticipated vehicle capital spending. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,492,720 1,082,332 862,994 Commercial rental 195,023 251,278 241,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 1,104,852 Operating property and equipment 71,772 77,360 59,767 Total capital expenditures 1,759,515 1,410,970 1,164,619 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (64,451 ) (11,591 ) (72,461 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,695,064 1,399,379 1,092,158 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $0.4 million and $54 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital expenditures grew in 2006 and 2005 due to increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after market devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $1.33 billion in 2007 as a result of reduced replacement activity and lower planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2007 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $4 million in 2006, $15 million in 2005 and $149 million in 2004. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2007. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 328,641 188,271 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 600,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 120,568 162,124 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (213,195 ) (200,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (165,324 ) (343,933 ) 620,690 406,462 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (663 ) (4,152 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 2,295 433 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 9,255 (593 ) Total changes in debt 631,577 402,150 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2006, compared with 32% at December 31, 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2006 Equity 2005 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,816,943 164% $ 2,185,366 143 % Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 77,998 117,062 Total obligations $ 2,894,941 168% $ 2,302,428 151 % (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2006 was driven by our increased capital spending required to support our contractual full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A significant downgrade of Ryders debt rating would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2006). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. Throughout 2006, we were in compliance with this and all other restrictive covenants for our revolving credit facility and do not expect the covenants to significantly affect our operations. The ratio at December 31, 2006 was 146%. At December 31, 2006, $113 million was available under the credit facility. During 1986, we issued at a discount $100 million principal amount of unsecured debentures due May 2016, with a stated interest rate of 9.0%, payable semi annually. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we retired $63 million principal amount of these debentures at a premium, which resulted in a charge of $2 million. The charge represents the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. During 2006, we issued $550 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, Ryder filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that was carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had $250 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs that would cause early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 11, 2007. At December 31, 2006, there were no receivables outstanding under the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 113 Shelf registration statement 250 Trade receivables facility 200 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables facility will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. In connection with these leases we have provided limited guarantees of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions during 2004 that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We have not entered into any sale leaseback transactions since 2004. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. In October 2006, Ryder entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of its independent directors. The terms of the indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that to the extent permitted by Florida law, Ryder will indemnify such director acting in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Ryder, against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $17 million and $16 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million and $3 million, respectively, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 332,124 269,720 1,468,587 743,003 2,813,434 Capital lease obligations 621 1,109 474 1,305 3,509 Total debt 332,745 270,829 1,469,061 744,308 2,816,943 Interest on debt(1) 139,648 245,390 138,172 262,139 785,349 Operating leases(2) 108,878 128,425 85,637 47,034 369,974 Purchase obligations(3) 340,427 41,850 4,350 386,627 Total contractual cash obligations 588,953 415,665 228,159 309,173 1,541,950 Insurance obligations(4) 117,311 113,414 47,754 29,930 308,409 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 24,831 3,667 2,010 48,591 79,099 Total $ 1,063,840 803,575 1,746,984 1,132,002 4,746,401 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2006. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations, deferred compensation obligations and derivative contracts. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2007, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $58 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2007 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $56 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Information At December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated net equity charge (after tax) of $201 million compared to $221 million as of December 31, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record a charge related to the unrecognized net actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition asset. The after tax equity charge of $201 million includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 which increased the equity charge by $151 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the equity charge of $178 million, prior to the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158, was principally the 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) result of fully funding accumulated benefit obligations of our primary pension plan. The improved funding levels resulted from strong investment returns on pension plan assets, global pension contributions during 2006, and a reduction in pension obligations as a result of a higher interest rate environment. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 14% in 2006. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2006, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $130 million compared with $12 million in 2005. After considering the 2006 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $56 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute will take effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will have on future pension funding requirements. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plan effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and will participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that meet the grandfathering criteria will be given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plan or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan is being replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plan. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the May 2006 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since March 1, 2006. The May 2006 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the May 2006 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. At December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.8 million shares under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $93 million. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the October 2005 program. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since May 1, 2004. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions, and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the July 2004 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. In October 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a $90 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Under the October 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the October 2003 program. In 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, under the October 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $44 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004. During 2006, we increased our annual dividend to $0.72 per share of common stock. In February 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.03 increase from the $0.18 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2006. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of the interest 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex to comparable earnings from continuing 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2004 Activity During 2004, Ryder recorded net restructuring and other recoveries of $18 million that consisted of gains from the sale of the previous headquarters complex and reversals of severance and employee related accruals partially offset by contract termination costs. During 2004, we recognized $24 million in gains from properties sold in connection with the relocation of our headquarters. In May 2004, we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters facility for $39 million in cash and recognized a $22 million gain from the sale. In conjunction with this sale, we entered into a lease agreement with the purchaser to lease back the headquarters facility until we relocated to our new headquarters in April 2005. Also during 2004, we recognized gains totaling $2 million from the sale of properties ancillary to our main headquarters facility. In 2004, as part of ongoing cost containment initiatives, Ryder management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced information technology infrastructure services to Ryder employees. Under the terms of the outsourcing agreement, Ryder was obligated to pay termination costs in the event of termination prior to the expiration date of 2010. In accordance with the terms of the services agreement, Ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling $8 million for contract termination ($6 million) and transition costs incurred since termination ($2 million). By December 31, 2004, all transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses starting in 2005. See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges (Recoveries) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

(2) See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all of our business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each of our business segments and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, corporate communications, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 16,983 15,860 14,971 Dedicated Contract Carriage 16,749 16,800 17,757 Total $ 33,732 32,660 32,728 Fleet Management Solutions Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Full service lease $ 1,848,141 1,785,606 1,766,675 4 % 1 Contract maintenance 141,933 134,492 136,327 6 (1 ) Contractual revenue 1,990,074 1,920,098 1,903,002 4 1 Contract related maintenance 193,134 191,128 178,049 1 7 Commercial rental 665,730 686,343 649,847 (3 ) 6 Other 72,124 67,362 69,743 7 (3 ) Operating revenue(1) 2,921,062 2,864,931 2,800,641 2 2 Fuel services revenue 1,174,984 1,056,260 802,198 11 32 Total revenue $ 4,096,046 3,921,191 3,602,839 4 % 9 Segment NBT $ 368,069 354,354 312,706 4 % 13 Segment NBT as a % of total revenue 9.0% 9.0% 8.7% bps 30 bps Segment NBT as a % of operating revenue (1) 12.6% 12.4% 11.2% 20 bps 120 bps (1) We use operating revenue, a non GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of our FMS business segment and as a measure of sales activity. Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue grew in 2006 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue increased in 2006 due to full service lease growth primarily in North America. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.3%. Contractual revenue growth in 2006 was realized in both FMS product lines. Full service lease revenue grew in 2006 due to higher lease rates and higher levels of sales activity in North America. Contract maintenance revenue increased in 2006 due primarily to new sales activity. In 2007, we expect each of our contractual product lines to demonstrate revenue growth based on 2006 sales activity levels and ongoing investments in new sales and business retention initiatives. Commercial rental revenue decreased in 2006 reflecting a smaller average fleet and lower vehicle utilization from a weakening 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) U.S. commercial rental market. In the fourth quarter of 2006, commercial rental revenue decreased 7% reflecting lower vehicle utilization and pricing. We expect similar unfavorable commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue in 2007; however, we expect percentage revenue declines to be greater in the first half of 2007 and improve in the second half of 2007. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Change Years ended December 31 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 282,528 296,435 292,241 (5 )% 1 Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 277,461 284,187 257,828 (2 )% 10 Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 33,400 34,400 34,700 (3 )% (1 ) Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 24,600 24,700 24,000 % 3 Commercial rental utilization 71.9% 74.6% 76.9% (270 )bps (230 )bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT grew $14 million during 2006 primarily as a result of revenue growth in our full service lease and contract maintenance product lines. The favorable impact of contractual revenue growth was partially offset by reduced commercial rental volumes, higher sales and marketing expenses, compensation related expenses and higher interest expense due primarily to planned higher debt levels to support investments in the full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. 2005 versus 2004 Total revenue grew in 2005 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue for 2005 increased as a result of higher commercial rental and contract related maintenance revenue and the impact of acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $21 million of total additional revenue in 2005. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2005 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.6%. Contractual revenue growth in 2005 was driven by growth in the full service lease product line and was slightly offset by contract maintenance revenue declines. Full service lease revenue increased in 2005 primarily from the acquisition completed in March 2004 and growth in Canada as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) in the first half of 2005. Our U.S. business showed improved revenue growth trends in the second half of 2005 as a result of positive net sales. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue, which generally represents ancillary services supporting core product lines, benefited from ongoing initiatives aimed at growing these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of stronger pricing and revenue contribution attributed to the acquisition completed in March 2004. During 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the fourth quarter of 2005, we also restructured our FMS operations to better service customers and drive future growth in full service lease. FMS NBT grew $42 million in 2005 as a result of improved commercial rental results from higher pricing, higher gains on disposal of used vehicles resulting from stronger volume and pricing, and lower overhead costs, including performance based incentive compensation.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The totals in the table above include the following non revenue earning equipment for the U.S. fleet (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ Number of Units 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 4,200 1,700 1,900 147 % (11 ) No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale 6,600 5,500 4,800 20 15 Other NLE units 1,900 1,400 1,600 36 (13 ) Total(1) 12,700 8,600 8,300 48 % 4 (1) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,700 in 2006 and 1,500 vehicles in 2005 and 2004, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. In 2006, the number of NYE units increased due to the volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2006 and 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to higher out servicing of rental units as well as the impact of increased lease replacement activity. We expect the number of NLE units to increase in the near term based on continuing lease replacement activity and planned out servicing of rental vehicles.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2006, GM accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect favorable revenue comparisons to continue over the near term. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups and better margins in our Brazil operations. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a $3 million benefit, net of variable compensation, related to a contract termination. 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was due primarily to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. In 2005, GM accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of 2005. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006 as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. Despite declining revenue growth trends in the second half of 2006, we expect favorable revenue comparisons in 2007 based on planned investments in sales and marketing initiatives. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs, including a hurricane related recovery. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 2005 versus 2004 Total CSS costs declined in 2005 due primarily to cost benefits associated with the insourcing and renegotiation of several information technology infrastructure services and lower performance based incentive compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarter facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarter relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Financing activities 488,202 241,505 (195,760 ) Investing activities (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) (720,113 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (2,327 ) (3,956 ) 9,368 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (88 ) 27,756 (39,656 ) 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, due primarily to higher earnings (adjusted for non cash items) and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Cash provided by financing activities for 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher vehicle capital spending. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. We manage our business to maximize net cash provided by operating activities (operating cash flows) and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,079 326,752 288,674 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,575 6,963 42,839 Collections on direct finance leases 66,274 70,408 63,795 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 Other, net 2,163 512 Total cash generated 1,254,678 1,183,185 1,381,202 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) Acquisitions (4,113 ) (15,110 ) (148,791 ) Free cash flow $ (444,499 ) (231,304 ) 140,253 We used $444 million of free cash flow compared to a use of $231 million in 2005 due to increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We used $231 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $140 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially offset by lower acquisition spending. We anticipate free cash flow levels to improve in 2007 as a result of lower anticipated vehicle capital spending. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,492,720 1,082,332 862,994 Commercial rental 195,023 251,278 241,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 1,104,852 Operating property and equipment 71,772 77,360 59,767 Total capital expenditures 1,759,515 1,410,970 1,164,619 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (64,451 ) (11,591 ) (72,461 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,695,064 1,399,379 1,092,158 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $0.4 million and $54 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital expenditures grew in 2006 and 2005 due to increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after market devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $1.33 billion in 2007 as a result of reduced replacement activity and lower planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2007 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $4 million in 2006, $15 million in 2005 and $149 million in 2004. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2007. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 328,641 188,271 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 600,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 120,568 162,124 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (213,195 ) (200,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (165,324 ) (343,933 ) 620,690 406,462 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (663 ) (4,152 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 2,295 433 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 9,255 (593 ) Total changes in debt 631,577 402,150 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2006, compared with 32% at December 31, 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2006 Equity 2005 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,816,943 164% $ 2,185,366 143 % Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 77,998 117,062 Total obligations $ 2,894,941 168% $ 2,302,428 151 % (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2006 was driven by our increased capital spending required to support our contractual full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A significant downgrade of Ryders debt rating would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2006). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. Throughout 2006, we were in compliance with this and all other restrictive covenants for our revolving credit facility and do not expect the covenants to significantly affect our operations. The ratio at December 31, 2006 was 146%. At December 31, 2006, $113 million was available under the credit facility. During 1986, we issued at a discount $100 million principal amount of unsecured debentures due May 2016, with a stated interest rate of 9.0%, payable semi annually. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we retired $63 million principal amount of these debentures at a premium, which resulted in a charge of $2 million. The charge represents the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. During 2006, we issued $550 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, Ryder filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that was carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had $250 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs that would cause early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 11, 2007. At December 31, 2006, there were no receivables outstanding under the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 113 Shelf registration statement 250 Trade receivables facility 200 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables facility will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. In connection with these leases we have provided limited guarantees of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions during 2004 that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We have not entered into any sale leaseback transactions since 2004. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. In October 2006, Ryder entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of its independent directors. The terms of the indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that to the extent permitted by Florida law, Ryder will indemnify such director acting in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Ryder, against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $17 million and $16 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million and $3 million, respectively, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 332,124 269,720 1,468,587 743,003 2,813,434 Capital lease obligations 621 1,109 474 1,305 3,509 Total debt 332,745 270,829 1,469,061 744,308 2,816,943 Interest on debt(1) 139,648 245,390 138,172 262,139 785,349 Operating leases(2) 108,878 128,425 85,637 47,034 369,974 Purchase obligations(3) 340,427 41,850 4,350 386,627 Total contractual cash obligations 588,953 415,665 228,159 309,173 1,541,950 Insurance obligations(4) 117,311 113,414 47,754 29,930 308,409 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 24,831 3,667 2,010 48,591 79,099 Total $ 1,063,840 803,575 1,746,984 1,132,002 4,746,401 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2006. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations, deferred compensation obligations and derivative contracts. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2007, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $58 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2007 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $56 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Information At December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated net equity charge (after tax) of $201 million compared to $221 million as of December 31, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record a charge related to the unrecognized net actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition asset. The after tax equity charge of $201 million includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 which increased the equity charge by $151 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the equity charge of $178 million, prior to the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158, was principally the 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) result of fully funding accumulated benefit obligations of our primary pension plan. The improved funding levels resulted from strong investment returns on pension plan assets, global pension contributions during 2006, and a reduction in pension obligations as a result of a higher interest rate environment. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 14% in 2006. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2006, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $130 million compared with $12 million in 2005. After considering the 2006 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $56 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute will take effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will have on future pension funding requirements. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plan effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and will participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that meet the grandfathering criteria will be given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plan or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan is being replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plan. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the May 2006 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since March 1, 2006. The May 2006 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the May 2006 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. At December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.8 million shares under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $93 million. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the October 2005 program. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since May 1, 2004. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions, and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the July 2004 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. In October 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a $90 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Under the October 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the October 2003 program. In 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, under the October 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $44 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004. During 2006, we increased our annual dividend to $0.72 per share of common stock. In February 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.03 increase from the $0.18 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2006. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of the interest 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex to comparable earnings from continuing 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As part of managements evaluation of segment operating performance, we define the primary measurement of our segment financial performance as Net Before Tax (NBT), which includes an allocation of CSS and excludes restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net and 2006 net retirement plan charges. The following table provides a reconciliation of items excluded from our segment NBT measure to their classification within our Consolidated Statements of Earnings: Consolidated Years ended December 31 Statements of Earnings Description Line Item(1) 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Severance and employee related (costs) recoveries Restructuring $ (1,048 ) (2,449 ) 1,216 Facilities and related (costs) recoveries Restructuring (194 ) (181 ) 79 Early retirement of debt Restructuring (2,141 ) Contract termination and transition costs Restructuring (181 ) (746 ) (8,000 ) Gain on sale of headquarter complex Restructuring 24,308 Other Restructuring 73 Restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net (3,564 ) (3,376 ) 17,676 Pension accounting charge(2) Salaries (5,872 ) Pension remeasurement benefit(2) Salaries 4,667 Postretirement benefit plan charge(2) Salaries (1,842 ) 2006 net retirement plan (charges) (3,047 ) Restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net and 2006 net retirement plan charges $ (6,611 ) (3,376 ) 17,676 (1) Restructuring refers to the Restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net and Salaries refers to Salaries and employee related costs on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. (2) See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all of our business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each of our business segments and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, corporate communications, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 16,983 15,860 14,971 Dedicated Contract Carriage 16,749 16,800 17,757 Total $ 33,732 32,660 32,728 Fleet Management Solutions Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Full service lease $ 1,848,141 1,785,606 1,766,675 4 % 1 Contract maintenance 141,933 134,492 136,327 6 (1 ) Contractual revenue 1,990,074 1,920,098 1,903,002 4 1 Contract related maintenance 193,134 191,128 178,049 1 7 Commercial rental 665,730 686,343 649,847 (3 ) 6 Other 72,124 67,362 69,743 7 (3 ) Operating revenue(1) 2,921,062 2,864,931 2,800,641 2 2 Fuel services revenue 1,174,984 1,056,260 802,198 11 32 Total revenue $ 4,096,046 3,921,191 3,602,839 4 % 9 Segment NBT $ 368,069 354,354 312,706 4 % 13 Segment NBT as a % of total revenue 9.0% 9.0% 8.7% bps 30 bps Segment NBT as a % of operating revenue (1) 12.6% 12.4% 11.2% 20 bps 120 bps (1) We use operating revenue, a non GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of our FMS business segment and as a measure of sales activity. Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue grew in 2006 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue increased in 2006 due to full service lease growth primarily in North America. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.3%. Contractual revenue growth in 2006 was realized in both FMS product lines. Full service lease revenue grew in 2006 due to higher lease rates and higher levels of sales activity in North America. Contract maintenance revenue increased in 2006 due primarily to new sales activity. In 2007, we expect each of our contractual product lines to demonstrate revenue growth based on 2006 sales activity levels and ongoing investments in new sales and business retention initiatives. Commercial rental revenue decreased in 2006 reflecting a smaller average fleet and lower vehicle utilization from a weakening 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) U.S. commercial rental market. In the fourth quarter of 2006, commercial rental revenue decreased 7% reflecting lower vehicle utilization and pricing. We expect similar unfavorable commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue in 2007; however, we expect percentage revenue declines to be greater in the first half of 2007 and improve in the second half of 2007. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Change Years ended December 31 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 282,528 296,435 292,241 (5 )% 1 Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 277,461 284,187 257,828 (2 )% 10 Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 33,400 34,400 34,700 (3 )% (1 ) Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 24,600 24,700 24,000 % 3 Commercial rental utilization 71.9% 74.6% 76.9% (270 )bps (230 )bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT grew $14 million during 2006 primarily as a result of revenue growth in our full service lease and contract maintenance product lines. The favorable impact of contractual revenue growth was partially offset by reduced commercial rental volumes, higher sales and marketing expenses, compensation related expenses and higher interest expense due primarily to planned higher debt levels to support investments in the full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. 2005 versus 2004 Total revenue grew in 2005 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue for 2005 increased as a result of higher commercial rental and contract related maintenance revenue and the impact of acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $21 million of total additional revenue in 2005. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2005 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.6%. Contractual revenue growth in 2005 was driven by growth in the full service lease product line and was slightly offset by contract maintenance revenue declines. Full service lease revenue increased in 2005 primarily from the acquisition completed in March 2004 and growth in Canada as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) in the first half of 2005. Our U.S. business showed improved revenue growth trends in the second half of 2005 as a result of positive net sales. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue, which generally represents ancillary services supporting core product lines, benefited from ongoing initiatives aimed at growing these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of stronger pricing and revenue contribution attributed to the acquisition completed in March 2004. During 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the fourth quarter of 2005, we also restructured our FMS operations to better service customers and drive future growth in full service lease. FMS NBT grew $42 million in 2005 as a result of improved commercial rental results from higher pricing, higher gains on disposal of used vehicles resulting from stronger volume and pricing, and lower overhead costs, including performance based incentive compensation. Our global fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment and contract maintenance vehicles is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2006 2005 2004 2006/ 2005/ 2005 2004 End of period vehicle count By type: Trucks 65,200 63,200 63,700 3 % (1 ) Tractors 56,100 52,700 51,700 6 2 Trailers 38,900 40,600 43,100 (4 ) (6 ) Other 5,700 5,800 5,900 (2 ) (2 ) Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) By ownership: Owned 160,800 156,500 157,000 3 % Leased 5,100 5,800 7,400 (12 ) (22 ) Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) By product line: Full service lease 117,500 113,700 115,300 3 % (1 ) Commercial rental 37,000 38,400 40,200 (4 ) (4 ) Service vehicles and other 3,500 3,300 3,000 6 10 Active units 158,000 155,400 158,500 2 (2 ) Held for sale(1) 7,900 6,900 5,900 14 17 Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 30,700 26,400 28,500 16 % (7 ) Year to date average vehicle count By product line: Full service lease 114,600 114,400 115,900 % (1 ) Commercial rental 38,700 40,200 39,900 (4 ) 1 Service vehicles and other 3,300 3,300 2,900 14 Active units 156,600 157,900 158,700 (1 ) (1 ) Held for sale(1) 6,700 7,000 5,600 (4 ) 25 Total 163,300 164,900 164,300 (1 )% Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 28,000 27,400 30,100 2 % (9 ) (1) Vehicles held for sale represent all units available for sale including units held for sale reported in the following table for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days (referred to as NLE units).

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. In 2006, the number of NYE units increased due to the volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2006 and 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to higher out servicing of rental units as well as the impact of increased lease replacement activity. We expect the number of NLE units to increase in the near term based on continuing lease replacement activity and planned out servicing of rental vehicles.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2006, GM accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect favorable revenue comparisons to continue over the near term. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups and better margins in our Brazil operations. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a $3 million benefit, net of variable compensation, related to a contract termination. 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was due primarily to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. In 2005, GM accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of 2005. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006 as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. Despite declining revenue growth trends in the second half of 2006, we expect favorable revenue comparisons in 2007 based on planned investments in sales and marketing initiatives. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs, including a hurricane related recovery. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 2005 versus 2004 Total CSS costs declined in 2005 due primarily to cost benefits associated with the insourcing and renegotiation of several information technology infrastructure services and lower performance based incentive compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarter facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarter relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Financing activities 488,202 241,505 (195,760 ) Investing activities (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) (720,113 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (2,327 ) (3,956 ) 9,368 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (88 ) 27,756 (39,656 ) 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, due primarily to higher earnings (adjusted for non cash items) and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Cash provided by financing activities for 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher vehicle capital spending. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. We manage our business to maximize net cash provided by operating activities (operating cash flows) and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,079 326,752 288,674 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,575 6,963 42,839 Collections on direct finance leases 66,274 70,408 63,795 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 Other, net 2,163 512 Total cash generated 1,254,678 1,183,185 1,381,202 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) Acquisitions (4,113 ) (15,110 ) (148,791 ) Free cash flow $ (444,499 ) (231,304 ) 140,253 We used $444 million of free cash flow compared to a use of $231 million in 2005 due to increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We used $231 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $140 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially offset by lower acquisition spending. We anticipate free cash flow levels to improve in 2007 as a result of lower anticipated vehicle capital spending. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,492,720 1,082,332 862,994 Commercial rental 195,023 251,278 241,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 1,104,852 Operating property and equipment 71,772 77,360 59,767 Total capital expenditures 1,759,515 1,410,970 1,164,619 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (64,451 ) (11,591 ) (72,461 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,695,064 1,399,379 1,092,158 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $0.4 million and $54 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital expenditures grew in 2006 and 2005 due to increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after market devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $1.33 billion in 2007 as a result of reduced replacement activity and lower planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2007 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $4 million in 2006, $15 million in 2005 and $149 million in 2004. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2007. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 328,641 188,271 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 600,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 120,568 162,124 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (213,195 ) (200,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (165,324 ) (343,933 ) 620,690 406,462 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (663 ) (4,152 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 2,295 433 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 9,255 (593 ) Total changes in debt 631,577 402,150 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2006, compared with 32% at December 31, 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2006 Equity 2005 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,816,943 164% $ 2,185,366 143 % Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 77,998 117,062 Total obligations $ 2,894,941 168% $ 2,302,428 151 % (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2006 was driven by our increased capital spending required to support our contractual full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A significant downgrade of Ryders debt rating would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2006). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. Throughout 2006, we were in compliance with this and all other restrictive covenants for our revolving credit facility and do not expect the covenants to significantly affect our operations. The ratio at December 31, 2006 was 146%. At December 31, 2006, $113 million was available under the credit facility. During 1986, we issued at a discount $100 million principal amount of unsecured debentures due May 2016, with a stated interest rate of 9.0%, payable semi annually. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we retired $63 million principal amount of these debentures at a premium, which resulted in a charge of $2 million. The charge represents the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. During 2006, we issued $550 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, Ryder filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that was carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had $250 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs that would cause early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 11, 2007. At December 31, 2006, there were no receivables outstanding under the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 113 Shelf registration statement 250 Trade receivables facility 200 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables facility will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. In connection with these leases we have provided limited guarantees of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions during 2004 that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We have not entered into any sale leaseback transactions since 2004. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. In October 2006, Ryder entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of its independent directors. The terms of the indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that to the extent permitted by Florida law, Ryder will indemnify such director acting in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Ryder, against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $17 million and $16 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million and $3 million, respectively, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations.

Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2006. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations, deferred compensation obligations and derivative contracts. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2007, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $58 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2007 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $56 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Information At December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated net equity charge (after tax) of $201 million compared to $221 million as of December 31, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record a charge related to the unrecognized net actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition asset. The after tax equity charge of $201 million includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 which increased the equity charge by $151 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the equity charge of $178 million, prior to the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158, was principally the 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) result of fully funding accumulated benefit obligations of our primary pension plan. The improved funding levels resulted from strong investment returns on pension plan assets, global pension contributions during 2006, and a reduction in pension obligations as a result of a higher interest rate environment. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 14% in 2006. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2006, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $130 million compared with $12 million in 2005. After considering the 2006 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $56 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute will take effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will have on future pension funding requirements. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plan effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and will participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that meet the grandfathering criteria will be given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plan or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan is being replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plan. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the May 2006 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since March 1, 2006. The May 2006 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the May 2006 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. At December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.8 million shares under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $93 million. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the October 2005 program. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since May 1, 2004. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions, and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the July 2004 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. In October 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a $90 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Under the October 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the October 2003 program. In 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, under the October 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $44 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004. During 2006, we increased our annual dividend to $0.72 per share of common stock. In February 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.03 increase from the $0.18 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2006. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of the interest 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As part of managements evaluation of segment operating performance, we define the primary measurement of our segment financial performance as Net Before Tax (NBT), which includes an allocation of CSS and excludes restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net and 2006 net retirement plan charges. The following table provides a reconciliation of items excluded from our segment NBT measure to their classification within our Consolidated Statements of Earnings: Consolidated Years ended December 31 Statements of Earnings Description Line Item(1) 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Severance and employee related (costs) recoveries Restructuring $ (1,048 ) (2,449 ) 1,216 Facilities and related (costs) recoveries Restructuring (194 ) (181 ) 79 Early retirement of debt Restructuring (2,141 ) Contract termination and transition costs Restructuring (181 ) (746 ) (8,000 ) Gain on sale of headquarter complex Restructuring 24,308 Other Restructuring 73 Restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net (3,564 ) (3,376 ) 17,676 Pension accounting charge(2) Salaries (5,872 ) Pension remeasurement benefit(2) Salaries 4,667 Postretirement benefit plan charge(2) Salaries (1,842 ) 2006 net retirement plan (charges) (3,047 ) Restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net and 2006 net retirement plan charges $ (6,611 ) (3,376 ) 17,676 (1) Restructuring refers to the Restructuring and other (charges) recoveries, net and Salaries refers to Salaries and employee related costs on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. (2) See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all of our business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each of our business segments and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, corporate communications, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 16,983 15,860 14,971 Dedicated Contract Carriage 16,749 16,800 17,757 Total $ 33,732 32,660 32,728 Fleet Management Solutions Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Full service lease $ 1,848,141 1,785,606 1,766,675 4 % 1 Contract maintenance 141,933 134,492 136,327 6 (1 ) Contractual revenue 1,990,074 1,920,098 1,903,002 4 1 Contract related maintenance 193,134 191,128 178,049 1 7 Commercial rental 665,730 686,343 649,847 (3 ) 6 Other 72,124 67,362 69,743 7 (3 ) Operating revenue(1) 2,921,062 2,864,931 2,800,641 2 2 Fuel services revenue 1,174,984 1,056,260 802,198 11 32 Total revenue $ 4,096,046 3,921,191 3,602,839 4 % 9 Segment NBT $ 368,069 354,354 312,706 4 % 13 Segment NBT as a % of total revenue 9.0% 9.0% 8.7% bps 30 bps Segment NBT as a % of operating revenue (1) 12.6% 12.4% 11.2% 20 bps 120 bps (1) We use operating revenue, a non GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of our FMS business segment and as a measure of sales activity. Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue grew in 2006 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue increased in 2006 due to full service lease growth primarily in North America. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.3%. Contractual revenue growth in 2006 was realized in both FMS product lines. Full service lease revenue grew in 2006 due to higher lease rates and higher levels of sales activity in North America. Contract maintenance revenue increased in 2006 due primarily to new sales activity. In 2007, we expect each of our contractual product lines to demonstrate revenue growth based on 2006 sales activity levels and ongoing investments in new sales and business retention initiatives. Commercial rental revenue decreased in 2006 reflecting a smaller average fleet and lower vehicle utilization from a weakening 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) U.S. commercial rental market. In the fourth quarter of 2006, commercial rental revenue decreased 7% reflecting lower vehicle utilization and pricing. We expect similar unfavorable commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue in 2007; however, we expect percentage revenue declines to be greater in the first half of 2007 and improve in the second half of 2007. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Change Years ended December 31 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 282,528 296,435 292,241 (5 )% 1 Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 277,461 284,187 257,828 (2 )% 10 Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 33,400 34,400 34,700 (3 )% (1 ) Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 24,600 24,700 24,000 % 3 Commercial rental utilization 71.9% 74.6% 76.9% (270 )bps (230 )bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT grew $14 million during 2006 primarily as a result of revenue growth in our full service lease and contract maintenance product lines. The favorable impact of contractual revenue growth was partially offset by reduced commercial rental volumes, higher sales and marketing expenses, compensation related expenses and higher interest expense due primarily to planned higher debt levels to support investments in the full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. 2005 versus 2004 Total revenue grew in 2005 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue for 2005 increased as a result of higher commercial rental and contract related maintenance revenue and the impact of acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $21 million of total additional revenue in 2005. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2005 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.6%. Contractual revenue growth in 2005 was driven by growth in the full service lease product line and was slightly offset by contract maintenance revenue declines. Full service lease revenue increased in 2005 primarily from the acquisition completed in March 2004 and growth in Canada as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) in the first half of 2005. Our U.S. business showed improved revenue growth trends in the second half of 2005 as a result of positive net sales. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue, which generally represents ancillary services supporting core product lines, benefited from ongoing initiatives aimed at growing these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of stronger pricing and revenue contribution attributed to the acquisition completed in March 2004. During 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the fourth quarter of 2005, we also restructured our FMS operations to better service customers and drive future growth in full service lease. FMS NBT grew $42 million in 2005 as a result of improved commercial rental results from higher pricing, higher gains on disposal of used vehicles resulting from stronger volume and pricing, and lower overhead costs, including performance based incentive compensation. Our global fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment and contract maintenance vehicles is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2006 2005 2004 2006/ 2005/ 2005 2004 End of period vehicle count By type: Trucks 65,200 63,200 63,700 3 % (1 ) Tractors 56,100 52,700 51,700 6 2 Trailers 38,900 40,600 43,100 (4 ) (6 ) Other 5,700 5,800 5,900 (2 ) (2 ) Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) By ownership: Owned 160,800 156,500 157,000 3 % Leased 5,100 5,800 7,400 (12 ) (22 ) Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) By product line: Full service lease 117,500 113,700 115,300 3 % (1 ) Commercial rental 37,000 38,400 40,200 (4 ) (4 ) Service vehicles and other 3,500 3,300 3,000 6 10 Active units 158,000 155,400 158,500 2 (2 ) Held for sale(1) 7,900 6,900 5,900 14 17 Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 30,700 26,400 28,500 16 % (7 ) Year to date average vehicle count By product line: Full service lease 114,600 114,400 115,900 % (1 ) Commercial rental 38,700 40,200 39,900 (4 ) 1 Service vehicles and other 3,300 3,300 2,900 14 Active units 156,600 157,900 158,700 (1 ) (1 ) Held for sale(1) 6,700 7,000 5,600 (4 ) 25 Total 163,300 164,900 164,300 (1 )% Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 28,000 27,400 30,100 2 % (9 ) (1) Vehicles held for sale represent all units available for sale including units held for sale reported in the following table for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days (referred to as NLE units).

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The totals in the table above include the following non revenue earning equipment for the U.S. fleet (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ Number of Units 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 4,200 1,700 1,900 147 % (11 ) No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale 6,600 5,500 4,800 20 15 Other NLE units 1,900 1,400 1,600 36 (13 ) Total(1) 12,700 8,600 8,300 48 % 4 (1) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,700 in 2006 and 1,500 vehicles in 2005 and 2004, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. In 2006, the number of NYE units increased due to the volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2006 and 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to higher out servicing of rental units as well as the impact of increased lease replacement activity. We expect the number of NLE units to increase in the near term based on continuing lease replacement activity and planned out servicing of rental vehicles.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2006, GM accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect favorable revenue comparisons to continue over the near term. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups and better margins in our Brazil operations. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a $3 million benefit, net of variable compensation, related to a contract termination. 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was due primarily to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. In 2005, GM accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of 2005. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006 as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. Despite declining revenue growth trends in the second half of 2006, we expect favorable revenue comparisons in 2007 based on planned investments in sales and marketing initiatives. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs, including a hurricane related recovery. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 2005 versus 2004 Total CSS costs declined in 2005 due primarily to cost benefits associated with the insourcing and renegotiation of several information technology infrastructure services and lower performance based incentive compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarter facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarter relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Financing activities 488,202 241,505 (195,760 ) Investing activities (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) (720,113 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (2,327 ) (3,956 ) 9,368 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (88 ) 27,756 (39,656 ) 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, due primarily to higher earnings (adjusted for non cash items) and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Cash provided by financing activities for 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher vehicle capital spending. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. We manage our business to maximize net cash provided by operating activities (operating cash flows) and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,079 326,752 288,674 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,575 6,963 42,839 Collections on direct finance leases 66,274 70,408 63,795 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 Other, net 2,163 512 Total cash generated 1,254,678 1,183,185 1,381,202 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) Acquisitions (4,113 ) (15,110 ) (148,791 ) Free cash flow $ (444,499 ) (231,304 ) 140,253 We used $444 million of free cash flow compared to a use of $231 million in 2005 due to increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We used $231 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $140 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially offset by lower acquisition spending. We anticipate free cash flow levels to improve in 2007 as a result of lower anticipated vehicle capital spending. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,492,720 1,082,332 862,994 Commercial rental 195,023 251,278 241,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 1,104,852 Operating property and equipment 71,772 77,360 59,767 Total capital expenditures 1,759,515 1,410,970 1,164,619 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (64,451 ) (11,591 ) (72,461 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,695,064 1,399,379 1,092,158 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $0.4 million and $54 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital expenditures grew in 2006 and 2005 due to increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after market devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $1.33 billion in 2007 as a result of reduced replacement activity and lower planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2007 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $4 million in 2006, $15 million in 2005 and $149 million in 2004. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2007. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 328,641 188,271 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 600,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 120,568 162,124 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (213,195 ) (200,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (165,324 ) (343,933 ) 620,690 406,462 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (663 ) (4,152 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 2,295 433 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 9,255 (593 ) Total changes in debt 631,577 402,150 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2006, compared with 32% at December 31, 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2006 Equity 2005 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,816,943 164% $ 2,185,366 143 % Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 77,998 117,062 Total obligations $ 2,894,941 168% $ 2,302,428 151 % (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2006 was driven by our increased capital spending required to support our contractual full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A significant downgrade of Ryders debt rating would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2006). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. Throughout 2006, we were in compliance with this and all other restrictive covenants for our revolving credit facility and do not expect the covenants to significantly affect our operations. The ratio at December 31, 2006 was 146%. At December 31, 2006, $113 million was available under the credit facility. During 1986, we issued at a discount $100 million principal amount of unsecured debentures due May 2016, with a stated interest rate of 9.0%, payable semi annually. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we retired $63 million principal amount of these debentures at a premium, which resulted in a charge of $2 million. The charge represents the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. During 2006, we issued $550 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, Ryder filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that was carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had $250 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs that would cause early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 11, 2007. At December 31, 2006, there were no receivables outstanding under the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 113 Shelf registration statement 250 Trade receivables facility 200 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables facility will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. In connection with these leases we have provided limited guarantees of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions during 2004 that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We have not entered into any sale leaseback transactions since 2004. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. In October 2006, Ryder entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of its independent directors. The terms of the indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that to the extent permitted by Florida law, Ryder will indemnify such director acting in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Ryder, against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $17 million and $16 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million and $3 million, respectively, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 332,124 269,720 1,468,587 743,003 2,813,434 Capital lease obligations 621 1,109 474 1,305 3,509 Total debt 332,745 270,829 1,469,061 744,308 2,816,943 Interest on debt(1) 139,648 245,390 138,172 262,139 785,349 Operating leases(2) 108,878 128,425 85,637 47,034 369,974 Purchase obligations(3) 340,427 41,850 4,350 386,627 Total contractual cash obligations 588,953 415,665 228,159 309,173 1,541,950 Insurance obligations(4) 117,311 113,414 47,754 29,930 308,409 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 24,831 3,667 2,010 48,591 79,099 Total $ 1,063,840 803,575 1,746,984 1,132,002 4,746,401 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2006. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations, deferred compensation obligations and derivative contracts. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2007, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $58 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2007 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $56 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Information At December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated net equity charge (after tax) of $201 million compared to $221 million as of December 31, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record a charge related to the unrecognized net actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition asset. The after tax equity charge of $201 million includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 which increased the equity charge by $151 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the equity charge of $178 million, prior to the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158, was principally the 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) result of fully funding accumulated benefit obligations of our primary pension plan. The improved funding levels resulted from strong investment returns on pension plan assets, global pension contributions during 2006, and a reduction in pension obligations as a result of a higher interest rate environment. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 14% in 2006. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2006, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $130 million compared with $12 million in 2005. After considering the 2006 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $56 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute will take effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will have on future pension funding requirements. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plan effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and will participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that meet the grandfathering criteria will be given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plan or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan is being replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plan. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the May 2006 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since March 1, 2006. The May 2006 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the May 2006 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. At December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.8 million shares under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $93 million. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the October 2005 program. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since May 1, 2004. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions, and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the July 2004 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. In October 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a $90 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Under the October 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the October 2003 program. In 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, under the October 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $44 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004. During 2006, we increased our annual dividend to $0.72 per share of common stock. In February 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.03 increase from the $0.18 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2006. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of the interest 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex to comparable earnings from continuing 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue grew in 2006 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue increased in 2006 due to full service lease growth primarily in North America. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.3%. Contractual revenue growth in 2006 was realized in both FMS product lines. Full service lease revenue grew in 2006 due to higher lease rates and higher levels of sales activity in North America. Contract maintenance revenue increased in 2006 due primarily to new sales activity. In 2007, we expect each of our contractual product lines to demonstrate revenue growth based on 2006 sales activity levels and ongoing investments in new sales and business retention initiatives. Commercial rental revenue decreased in 2006 reflecting a smaller average fleet and lower vehicle utilization from a weakening 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) U.S. commercial rental market. In the fourth quarter of 2006, commercial rental revenue decreased 7% reflecting lower vehicle utilization and pricing. We expect similar unfavorable commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue in 2007; however, we expect percentage revenue declines to be greater in the first half of 2007 and improve in the second half of 2007. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Change Years ended December 31 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 282,528 296,435 292,241 (5 )% 1 Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 277,461 284,187 257,828 (2 )% 10 Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 33,400 34,400 34,700 (3 )% (1 ) Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 24,600 24,700 24,000 % 3 Commercial rental utilization 71.9% 74.6% 76.9% (270 )bps (230 )bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT grew $14 million during 2006 primarily as a result of revenue growth in our full service lease and contract maintenance product lines. The favorable impact of contractual revenue growth was partially offset by reduced commercial rental volumes, higher sales and marketing expenses, compensation related expenses and higher interest expense due primarily to planned higher debt levels to support investments in the full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. 2005 versus 2004 Total revenue grew in 2005 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue for 2005 increased as a result of higher commercial rental and contract related maintenance revenue and the impact of acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $21 million of total additional revenue in 2005. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2005 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.6%. Contractual revenue growth in 2005 was driven by growth in the full service lease product line and was slightly offset by contract maintenance revenue declines. Full service lease revenue increased in 2005 primarily from the acquisition completed in March 2004 and growth in Canada as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) in the first half of 2005. Our U.S. business showed improved revenue growth trends in the second half of 2005 as a result of positive net sales. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue, which generally represents ancillary services supporting core product lines, benefited from ongoing initiatives aimed at growing these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of stronger pricing and revenue contribution attributed to the acquisition completed in March 2004. During 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the fourth quarter of 2005, we also restructured our FMS operations to better service customers and drive future growth in full service lease. FMS NBT grew $42 million in 2005 as a result of improved commercial rental results from higher pricing, higher gains on disposal of used vehicles resulting from stronger volume and pricing, and lower overhead costs, including performance based incentive compensation. Our global fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment and contract maintenance vehicles is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2006 2005 2004 2006/ 2005/ 2005 2004 End of period vehicle count By type: Trucks 65,200 63,200 63,700 3 % (1 ) Tractors 56,100 52,700 51,700 6 2 Trailers 38,900 40,600 43,100 (4 ) (6 ) Other 5,700 5,800 5,900 (2 ) (2 ) Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) By ownership: Owned 160,800 156,500 157,000 3 % Leased 5,100 5,800 7,400 (12 ) (22 ) Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) By product line: Full service lease 117,500 113,700 115,300 3 % (1 ) Commercial rental 37,000 38,400 40,200 (4 ) (4 ) Service vehicles and other 3,500 3,300 3,000 6 10 Active units 158,000 155,400 158,500 2 (2 ) Held for sale(1) 7,900 6,900 5,900 14 17 Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 30,700 26,400 28,500 16 % (7 ) Year to date average vehicle count By product line: Full service lease 114,600 114,400 115,900 % (1 ) Commercial rental 38,700 40,200 39,900 (4 ) 1 Service vehicles and other 3,300 3,300 2,900 14 Active units 156,600 157,900 158,700 (1 ) (1 ) Held for sale(1) 6,700 7,000 5,600 (4 ) 25 Total 163,300 164,900 164,300 (1 )% Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 28,000 27,400 30,100 2 % (9 ) (1) Vehicles held for sale represent all units available for sale including units held for sale reported in the following table for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days (referred to as NLE units).

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The totals in the table above include the following non revenue earning equipment for the U.S. fleet (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ Number of Units 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 4,200 1,700 1,900 147 % (11 ) No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale 6,600 5,500 4,800 20 15 Other NLE units 1,900 1,400 1,600 36 (13 ) Total(1) 12,700 8,600 8,300 48 % 4 (1) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,700 in 2006 and 1,500 vehicles in 2005 and 2004, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. In 2006, the number of NYE units increased due to the volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2006 and 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to higher out servicing of rental units as well as the impact of increased lease replacement activity. We expect the number of NLE units to increase in the near term based on continuing lease replacement activity and planned out servicing of rental vehicles.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2006, GM accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect favorable revenue comparisons to continue over the near term. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups and better margins in our Brazil operations. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a $3 million benefit, net of variable compensation, related to a contract termination. 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was due primarily to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. In 2005, GM accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of 2005. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006 as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. Despite declining revenue growth trends in the second half of 2006, we expect favorable revenue comparisons in 2007 based on planned investments in sales and marketing initiatives. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs, including a hurricane related recovery. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 2005 versus 2004 Total CSS costs declined in 2005 due primarily to cost benefits associated with the insourcing and renegotiation of several information technology infrastructure services and lower performance based incentive compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarter facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarter relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Financing activities 488,202 241,505 (195,760 ) Investing activities (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) (720,113 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (2,327 ) (3,956 ) 9,368 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (88 ) 27,756 (39,656 ) 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, due primarily to higher earnings (adjusted for non cash items) and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Cash provided by financing activities for 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher vehicle capital spending. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. We manage our business to maximize net cash provided by operating activities (operating cash flows) and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,079 326,752 288,674 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,575 6,963 42,839 Collections on direct finance leases 66,274 70,408 63,795 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 Other, net 2,163 512 Total cash generated 1,254,678 1,183,185 1,381,202 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) Acquisitions (4,113 ) (15,110 ) (148,791 ) Free cash flow $ (444,499 ) (231,304 ) 140,253 We used $444 million of free cash flow compared to a use of $231 million in 2005 due to increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We used $231 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $140 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially offset by lower acquisition spending. We anticipate free cash flow levels to improve in 2007 as a result of lower anticipated vehicle capital spending. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,492,720 1,082,332 862,994 Commercial rental 195,023 251,278 241,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 1,104,852 Operating property and equipment 71,772 77,360 59,767 Total capital expenditures 1,759,515 1,410,970 1,164,619 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (64,451 ) (11,591 ) (72,461 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,695,064 1,399,379 1,092,158 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $0.4 million and $54 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital expenditures grew in 2006 and 2005 due to increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after market devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $1.33 billion in 2007 as a result of reduced replacement activity and lower planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2007 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $4 million in 2006, $15 million in 2005 and $149 million in 2004. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2007. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 328,641 188,271 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 600,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 120,568 162,124 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (213,195 ) (200,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (165,324 ) (343,933 ) 620,690 406,462 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (663 ) (4,152 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 2,295 433 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 9,255 (593 ) Total changes in debt 631,577 402,150 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2006, compared with 32% at December 31, 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2006 Equity 2005 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,816,943 164% $ 2,185,366 143 % Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 77,998 117,062 Total obligations $ 2,894,941 168% $ 2,302,428 151 % (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2006 was driven by our increased capital spending required to support our contractual full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A significant downgrade of Ryders debt rating would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2006). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. Throughout 2006, we were in compliance with this and all other restrictive covenants for our revolving credit facility and do not expect the covenants to significantly affect our operations. The ratio at December 31, 2006 was 146%. At December 31, 2006, $113 million was available under the credit facility. During 1986, we issued at a discount $100 million principal amount of unsecured debentures due May 2016, with a stated interest rate of 9.0%, payable semi annually. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we retired $63 million principal amount of these debentures at a premium, which resulted in a charge of $2 million. The charge represents the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. During 2006, we issued $550 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, Ryder filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that was carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had $250 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs that would cause early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 11, 2007. At December 31, 2006, there were no receivables outstanding under the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 113 Shelf registration statement 250 Trade receivables facility 200 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables facility will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. In connection with these leases we have provided limited guarantees of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions during 2004 that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We have not entered into any sale leaseback transactions since 2004. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. In October 2006, Ryder entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of its independent directors. The terms of the indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that to the extent permitted by Florida law, Ryder will indemnify such director acting in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Ryder, against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $17 million and $16 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million and $3 million, respectively, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 332,124 269,720 1,468,587 743,003 2,813,434 Capital lease obligations 621 1,109 474 1,305 3,509 Total debt 332,745 270,829 1,469,061 744,308 2,816,943 Interest on debt(1) 139,648 245,390 138,172 262,139 785,349 Operating leases(2) 108,878 128,425 85,637 47,034 369,974 Purchase obligations(3) 340,427 41,850 4,350 386,627 Total contractual cash obligations 588,953 415,665 228,159 309,173 1,541,950 Insurance obligations(4) 117,311 113,414 47,754 29,930 308,409 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 24,831 3,667 2,010 48,591 79,099 Total $ 1,063,840 803,575 1,746,984 1,132,002 4,746,401 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2006. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations, deferred compensation obligations and derivative contracts. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2007, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $58 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2007 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $56 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Information At December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated net equity charge (after tax) of $201 million compared to $221 million as of December 31, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record a charge related to the unrecognized net actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition asset. The after tax equity charge of $201 million includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 which increased the equity charge by $151 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the equity charge of $178 million, prior to the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158, was principally the 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) result of fully funding accumulated benefit obligations of our primary pension plan. The improved funding levels resulted from strong investment returns on pension plan assets, global pension contributions during 2006, and a reduction in pension obligations as a result of a higher interest rate environment. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 14% in 2006. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2006, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $130 million compared with $12 million in 2005. After considering the 2006 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $56 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute will take effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will have on future pension funding requirements. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plan effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and will participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that meet the grandfathering criteria will be given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plan or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan is being replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plan. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the May 2006 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since March 1, 2006. The May 2006 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the May 2006 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. At December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.8 million shares under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $93 million. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the October 2005 program. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since May 1, 2004. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions, and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the July 2004 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. In October 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a $90 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Under the October 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the October 2003 program. In 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, under the October 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $44 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004. During 2006, we increased our annual dividend to $0.72 per share of common stock. In February 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.03 increase from the $0.18 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2006. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of the interest 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex to comparable earnings from continuing 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) U.S. commercial rental market. In the fourth quarter of 2006, commercial rental revenue decreased 7% reflecting lower vehicle utilization and pricing. We expect similar unfavorable commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue in 2007; however, we expect percentage revenue declines to be greater in the first half of 2007 and improve in the second half of 2007. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Change Years ended December 31 2006/ 2005/ 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 282,528 296,435 292,241 (5 )% 1 Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 277,461 284,187 257,828 (2 )% 10 Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 33,400 34,400 34,700 (3 )% (1 ) Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 24,600 24,700 24,000 % 3 Commercial rental utilization 71.9% 74.6% 76.9% (270 )bps (230 )bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT grew $14 million during 2006 primarily as a result of revenue growth in our full service lease and contract maintenance product lines. The favorable impact of contractual revenue growth was partially offset by reduced commercial rental volumes, higher sales and marketing expenses, compensation related expenses and higher interest expense due primarily to planned higher debt levels to support investments in the full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. 2005 versus 2004 Total revenue grew in 2005 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue for 2005 increased as a result of higher commercial rental and contract related maintenance revenue and the impact of acquisitions. FMS acquisitions contributed approximately $21 million of total additional revenue in 2005. FMS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons for 2005 also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. FMS total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.6%. Contractual revenue growth in 2005 was driven by growth in the full service lease product line and was slightly offset by contract maintenance revenue declines. Full service lease revenue increased in 2005 primarily from the acquisition completed in March 2004 and growth in Canada as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced full service lease revenue in our base U.S. business (excluding acquisitions) in the first half of 2005. Our U.S. business showed improved revenue growth trends in the second half of 2005 as a result of positive net sales. Contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business. Contract related maintenance revenue, which generally represents ancillary services supporting core product lines, benefited from ongoing initiatives aimed at growing these service offerings. Commercial rental revenue increased as a result of stronger pricing and revenue contribution attributed to the acquisition completed in March 2004. During 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the fourth quarter of 2005, we also restructured our FMS operations to better service customers and drive future growth in full service lease. FMS NBT grew $42 million in 2005 as a result of improved commercial rental results from higher pricing, higher gains on disposal of used vehicles resulting from stronger volume and pricing, and lower overhead costs, including performance based incentive compensation. Our global fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment and contract maintenance vehicles is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2006 2005 2004 2006/ 2005/ 2005 2004 End of period vehicle count By type: Trucks 65,200 63,200 63,700 3 % (1 ) Tractors 56,100 52,700 51,700 6 2 Trailers 38,900 40,600 43,100 (4 ) (6 ) Other 5,700 5,800 5,900 (2 ) (2 ) Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) By ownership: Owned 160,800 156,500 157,000 3 % Leased 5,100 5,800 7,400 (12 ) (22 ) Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) By product line: Full service lease 117,500 113,700 115,300 3 % (1 ) Commercial rental 37,000 38,400 40,200 (4 ) (4 ) Service vehicles and other 3,500 3,300 3,000 6 10 Active units 158,000 155,400 158,500 2 (2 ) Held for sale(1) 7,900 6,900 5,900 14 17 Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 30,700 26,400 28,500 16 % (7 ) Year to date average vehicle count By product line: Full service lease 114,600 114,400 115,900 % (1 ) Commercial rental 38,700 40,200 39,900 (4 ) 1 Service vehicles and other 3,300 3,300 2,900 14 Active units 156,600 157,900 158,700 (1 ) (1 ) Held for sale(1) 6,700 7,000 5,600 (4 ) 25 Total 163,300 164,900 164,300 (1 )% Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 28,000 27,400 30,100 2 % (9 ) (1) Vehicles held for sale represent all units available for sale including units held for sale reported in the following table for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days (referred to as NLE units).

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. In 2006, the number of NYE units increased due to the volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2006 and 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to higher out servicing of rental units as well as the impact of increased lease replacement activity. We expect the number of NLE units to increase in the near term based on continuing lease replacement activity and planned out servicing of rental vehicles.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2006, GM accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect favorable revenue comparisons to continue over the near term. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups and better margins in our Brazil operations. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a $3 million benefit, net of variable compensation, related to a contract termination. 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was due primarily to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. In 2005, GM accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of 2005. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006 as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. Despite declining revenue growth trends in the second half of 2006, we expect favorable revenue comparisons in 2007 based on planned investments in sales and marketing initiatives. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs, including a hurricane related recovery. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 2005 versus 2004 Total CSS costs declined in 2005 due primarily to cost benefits associated with the insourcing and renegotiation of several information technology infrastructure services and lower performance based incentive compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarter facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarter relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Financing activities 488,202 241,505 (195,760 ) Investing activities (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) (720,113 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (2,327 ) (3,956 ) 9,368 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (88 ) 27,756 (39,656 ) 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, due primarily to higher earnings (adjusted for non cash items) and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Cash provided by financing activities for 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher vehicle capital spending. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. We manage our business to maximize net cash provided by operating activities (operating cash flows) and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,079 326,752 288,674 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,575 6,963 42,839 Collections on direct finance leases 66,274 70,408 63,795 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 Other, net 2,163 512 Total cash generated 1,254,678 1,183,185 1,381,202 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) Acquisitions (4,113 ) (15,110 ) (148,791 ) Free cash flow $ (444,499 ) (231,304 ) 140,253 We used $444 million of free cash flow compared to a use of $231 million in 2005 due to increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We used $231 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $140 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially offset by lower acquisition spending. We anticipate free cash flow levels to improve in 2007 as a result of lower anticipated vehicle capital spending. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,492,720 1,082,332 862,994 Commercial rental 195,023 251,278 241,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 1,104,852 Operating property and equipment 71,772 77,360 59,767 Total capital expenditures 1,759,515 1,410,970 1,164,619 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (64,451 ) (11,591 ) (72,461 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,695,064 1,399,379 1,092,158 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $0.4 million and $54 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital expenditures grew in 2006 and 2005 due to increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after market devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $1.33 billion in 2007 as a result of reduced replacement activity and lower planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2007 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $4 million in 2006, $15 million in 2005 and $149 million in 2004. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2007. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 328,641 188,271 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 600,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 120,568 162,124 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (213,195 ) (200,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (165,324 ) (343,933 ) 620,690 406,462 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (663 ) (4,152 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 2,295 433 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 9,255 (593 ) Total changes in debt 631,577 402,150 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2006, compared with 32% at December 31, 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2006 Equity 2005 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,816,943 164% $ 2,185,366 143 % Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 77,998 117,062 Total obligations $ 2,894,941 168% $ 2,302,428 151 % (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2006 was driven by our increased capital spending required to support our contractual full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A significant downgrade of Ryders debt rating would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2006). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. Throughout 2006, we were in compliance with this and all other restrictive covenants for our revolving credit facility and do not expect the covenants to significantly affect our operations. The ratio at December 31, 2006 was 146%. At December 31, 2006, $113 million was available under the credit facility. During 1986, we issued at a discount $100 million principal amount of unsecured debentures due May 2016, with a stated interest rate of 9.0%, payable semi annually. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we retired $63 million principal amount of these debentures at a premium, which resulted in a charge of $2 million. The charge represents the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. During 2006, we issued $550 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, Ryder filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that was carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had $250 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs that would cause early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 11, 2007. At December 31, 2006, there were no receivables outstanding under the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 113 Shelf registration statement 250 Trade receivables facility 200 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables facility will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. In connection with these leases we have provided limited guarantees of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions during 2004 that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We have not entered into any sale leaseback transactions since 2004. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. In October 2006, Ryder entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of its independent directors. The terms of the indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that to the extent permitted by Florida law, Ryder will indemnify such director acting in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Ryder, against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $17 million and $16 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million and $3 million, respectively, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 332,124 269,720 1,468,587 743,003 2,813,434 Capital lease obligations 621 1,109 474 1,305 3,509 Total debt 332,745 270,829 1,469,061 744,308 2,816,943 Interest on debt(1) 139,648 245,390 138,172 262,139 785,349 Operating leases(2) 108,878 128,425 85,637 47,034 369,974 Purchase obligations(3) 340,427 41,850 4,350 386,627 Total contractual cash obligations 588,953 415,665 228,159 309,173 1,541,950 Insurance obligations(4) 117,311 113,414 47,754 29,930 308,409 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 24,831 3,667 2,010 48,591 79,099 Total $ 1,063,840 803,575 1,746,984 1,132,002 4,746,401 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2006. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations, deferred compensation obligations and derivative contracts. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2007, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $58 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2007 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $56 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Information At December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated net equity charge (after tax) of $201 million compared to $221 million as of December 31, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record a charge related to the unrecognized net actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition asset. The after tax equity charge of $201 million includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 which increased the equity charge by $151 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the equity charge of $178 million, prior to the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158, was principally the 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) result of fully funding accumulated benefit obligations of our primary pension plan. The improved funding levels resulted from strong investment returns on pension plan assets, global pension contributions during 2006, and a reduction in pension obligations as a result of a higher interest rate environment. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 14% in 2006. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2006, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $130 million compared with $12 million in 2005. After considering the 2006 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $56 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute will take effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will have on future pension funding requirements. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plan effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and will participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that meet the grandfathering criteria will be given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plan or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan is being replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plan. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the May 2006 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since March 1, 2006. The May 2006 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the May 2006 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. At December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.8 million shares under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $93 million. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the October 2005 program. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since May 1, 2004. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions, and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the July 2004 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. In October 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a $90 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Under the October 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the October 2003 program. In 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, under the October 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $44 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004. During 2006, we increased our annual dividend to $0.72 per share of common stock. In February 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.03 increase from the $0.18 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2006. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of the interest 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex to comparable earnings from continuing 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) the fourth quarter of 2005, we also restructured our FMS operations to better service customers and drive future growth in full service lease. FMS NBT grew $42 million in 2005 as a result of improved commercial rental results from higher pricing, higher gains on disposal of used vehicles resulting from stronger volume and pricing, and lower overhead costs, including performance based incentive compensation. Our global fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment and contract maintenance vehicles is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2006 2005 2004 2006/ 2005/ 2005 2004 End of period vehicle count By type: Trucks 65,200 63,200 63,700 3 % (1 ) Tractors 56,100 52,700 51,700 6 2 Trailers 38,900 40,600 43,100 (4 ) (6 ) Other 5,700 5,800 5,900 (2 ) (2 ) Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) By ownership: Owned 160,800 156,500 157,000 3 % Leased 5,100 5,800 7,400 (12 ) (22 ) Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) By product line: Full service lease 117,500 113,700 115,300 3 % (1 ) Commercial rental 37,000 38,400 40,200 (4 ) (4 ) Service vehicles and other 3,500 3,300 3,000 6 10 Active units 158,000 155,400 158,500 2 (2 ) Held for sale(1) 7,900 6,900 5,900 14 17 Total 165,900 162,300 164,400 2 % (1 ) Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 30,700 26,400 28,500 16 % (7 ) Year to date average vehicle count By product line: Full service lease 114,600 114,400 115,900 % (1 ) Commercial rental 38,700 40,200 39,900 (4 ) 1 Service vehicles and other 3,300 3,300 2,900 14 Active units 156,600 157,900 158,700 (1 ) (1 ) Held for sale(1) 6,700 7,000 5,600 (4 ) 25 Total 163,300 164,900 164,300 (1 )% Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 28,000 27,400 30,100 2 % (9 ) (1) Vehicles held for sale represent all units available for sale including units held for sale reported in the following table for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days (referred to as NLE units).

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The totals in the table above include the following non revenue earning equipment for the U.S. fleet (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ Number of Units 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 4,200 1,700 1,900 147 % (11 ) No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale 6,600 5,500 4,800 20 15 Other NLE units 1,900 1,400 1,600 36 (13 ) Total(1) 12,700 8,600 8,300 48 % 4 (1) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,700 in 2006 and 1,500 vehicles in 2005 and 2004, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. In 2006, the number of NYE units increased due to the volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2006 and 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to higher out servicing of rental units as well as the impact of increased lease replacement activity. We expect the number of NLE units to increase in the near term based on continuing lease replacement activity and planned out servicing of rental vehicles.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2006, GM accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect favorable revenue comparisons to continue over the near term. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups and better margins in our Brazil operations. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a $3 million benefit, net of variable compensation, related to a contract termination. 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was due primarily to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. In 2005, GM accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of 2005. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006 as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. Despite declining revenue growth trends in the second half of 2006, we expect favorable revenue comparisons in 2007 based on planned investments in sales and marketing initiatives. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs, including a hurricane related recovery. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 2005 versus 2004 Total CSS costs declined in 2005 due primarily to cost benefits associated with the insourcing and renegotiation of several information technology infrastructure services and lower performance based incentive compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarter facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarter relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Financing activities 488,202 241,505 (195,760 ) Investing activities (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) (720,113 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (2,327 ) (3,956 ) 9,368 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (88 ) 27,756 (39,656 ) 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, due primarily to higher earnings (adjusted for non cash items) and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Cash provided by financing activities for 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher vehicle capital spending. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. We manage our business to maximize net cash provided by operating activities (operating cash flows) and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,079 326,752 288,674 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,575 6,963 42,839 Collections on direct finance leases 66,274 70,408 63,795 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 Other, net 2,163 512 Total cash generated 1,254,678 1,183,185 1,381,202 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) Acquisitions (4,113 ) (15,110 ) (148,791 ) Free cash flow $ (444,499 ) (231,304 ) 140,253 We used $444 million of free cash flow compared to a use of $231 million in 2005 due to increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We used $231 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $140 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially offset by lower acquisition spending. We anticipate free cash flow levels to improve in 2007 as a result of lower anticipated vehicle capital spending. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,492,720 1,082,332 862,994 Commercial rental 195,023 251,278 241,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 1,104,852 Operating property and equipment 71,772 77,360 59,767 Total capital expenditures 1,759,515 1,410,970 1,164,619 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (64,451 ) (11,591 ) (72,461 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,695,064 1,399,379 1,092,158 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $0.4 million and $54 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital expenditures grew in 2006 and 2005 due to increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after market devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $1.33 billion in 2007 as a result of reduced replacement activity and lower planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2007 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $4 million in 2006, $15 million in 2005 and $149 million in 2004. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2007. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 328,641 188,271 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 600,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 120,568 162,124 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (213,195 ) (200,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (165,324 ) (343,933 ) 620,690 406,462 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (663 ) (4,152 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 2,295 433 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 9,255 (593 ) Total changes in debt 631,577 402,150 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2006, compared with 32% at December 31, 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2006 Equity 2005 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,816,943 164% $ 2,185,366 143 % Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 77,998 117,062 Total obligations $ 2,894,941 168% $ 2,302,428 151 % (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2006 was driven by our increased capital spending required to support our contractual full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A significant downgrade of Ryders debt rating would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2006). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. Throughout 2006, we were in compliance with this and all other restrictive covenants for our revolving credit facility and do not expect the covenants to significantly affect our operations. The ratio at December 31, 2006 was 146%. At December 31, 2006, $113 million was available under the credit facility. During 1986, we issued at a discount $100 million principal amount of unsecured debentures due May 2016, with a stated interest rate of 9.0%, payable semi annually. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we retired $63 million principal amount of these debentures at a premium, which resulted in a charge of $2 million. The charge represents the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. During 2006, we issued $550 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, Ryder filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that was carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had $250 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs that would cause early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 11, 2007. At December 31, 2006, there were no receivables outstanding under the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 113 Shelf registration statement 250 Trade receivables facility 200 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables facility will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. In connection with these leases we have provided limited guarantees of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions during 2004 that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We have not entered into any sale leaseback transactions since 2004. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. In October 2006, Ryder entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of its independent directors. The terms of the indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that to the extent permitted by Florida law, Ryder will indemnify such director acting in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Ryder, against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $17 million and $16 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million and $3 million, respectively, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 332,124 269,720 1,468,587 743,003 2,813,434 Capital lease obligations 621 1,109 474 1,305 3,509 Total debt 332,745 270,829 1,469,061 744,308 2,816,943 Interest on debt(1) 139,648 245,390 138,172 262,139 785,349 Operating leases(2) 108,878 128,425 85,637 47,034 369,974 Purchase obligations(3) 340,427 41,850 4,350 386,627 Total contractual cash obligations 588,953 415,665 228,159 309,173 1,541,950 Insurance obligations(4) 117,311 113,414 47,754 29,930 308,409 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 24,831 3,667 2,010 48,591 79,099 Total $ 1,063,840 803,575 1,746,984 1,132,002 4,746,401 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2006. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations, deferred compensation obligations and derivative contracts. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2007, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $58 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2007 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $56 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Information At December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated net equity charge (after tax) of $201 million compared to $221 million as of December 31, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record a charge related to the unrecognized net actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition asset. The after tax equity charge of $201 million includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 which increased the equity charge by $151 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the equity charge of $178 million, prior to the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158, was principally the 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) result of fully funding accumulated benefit obligations of our primary pension plan. The improved funding levels resulted from strong investment returns on pension plan assets, global pension contributions during 2006, and a reduction in pension obligations as a result of a higher interest rate environment. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 14% in 2006. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2006, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $130 million compared with $12 million in 2005. After considering the 2006 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $56 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute will take effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will have on future pension funding requirements. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plan effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and will participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that meet the grandfathering criteria will be given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plan or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan is being replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plan. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the May 2006 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since March 1, 2006. The May 2006 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the May 2006 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. At December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.8 million shares under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $93 million. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the October 2005 program. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since May 1, 2004. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions, and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the July 2004 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. In October 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a $90 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Under the October 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the October 2003 program. In 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, under the October 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $44 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004. During 2006, we increased our annual dividend to $0.72 per share of common stock. In February 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.03 increase from the $0.18 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2006. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of the interest 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex to comparable earnings from continuing 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The totals in the table above include the following non revenue earning equipment for the U.S. fleet (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2006/ 2005/ Number of Units 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 4,200 1,700 1,900 147 % (11 ) No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale 6,600 5,500 4,800 20 15 Other NLE units 1,900 1,400 1,600 36 (13 ) Total(1) 12,700 8,600 8,300 48 % 4 (1) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,700 in 2006 and 1,500 vehicles in 2005 and 2004, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. In 2006, the number of NYE units increased due to the volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. In 2006 and 2005, the total number of NLE units increased due to higher out servicing of rental units as well as the impact of increased lease replacement activity. We expect the number of NLE units to increase in the near term based on continuing lease replacement activity and planned out servicing of rental vehicles.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2006, GM accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect favorable revenue comparisons to continue over the near term. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups and better margins in our Brazil operations. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a $3 million benefit, net of variable compensation, related to a contract termination. 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was due primarily to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. In 2005, GM accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of 2005. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006 as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. Despite declining revenue growth trends in the second half of 2006, we expect favorable revenue comparisons in 2007 based on planned investments in sales and marketing initiatives. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs, including a hurricane related recovery. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 2005 versus 2004 Total CSS costs declined in 2005 due primarily to cost benefits associated with the insourcing and renegotiation of several information technology infrastructure services and lower performance based incentive compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarter facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarter relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Financing activities 488,202 241,505 (195,760 ) Investing activities (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) (720,113 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (2,327 ) (3,956 ) 9,368 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (88 ) 27,756 (39,656 ) 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, due primarily to higher earnings (adjusted for non cash items) and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Cash provided by financing activities for 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher vehicle capital spending. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. We manage our business to maximize net cash provided by operating activities (operating cash flows) and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,079 326,752 288,674 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,575 6,963 42,839 Collections on direct finance leases 66,274 70,408 63,795 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 Other, net 2,163 512 Total cash generated 1,254,678 1,183,185 1,381,202 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) Acquisitions (4,113 ) (15,110 ) (148,791 ) Free cash flow $ (444,499 ) (231,304 ) 140,253 We used $444 million of free cash flow compared to a use of $231 million in 2005 due to increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We used $231 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $140 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially offset by lower acquisition spending. We anticipate free cash flow levels to improve in 2007 as a result of lower anticipated vehicle capital spending. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,492,720 1,082,332 862,994 Commercial rental 195,023 251,278 241,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 1,104,852 Operating property and equipment 71,772 77,360 59,767 Total capital expenditures 1,759,515 1,410,970 1,164,619 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (64,451 ) (11,591 ) (72,461 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,695,064 1,399,379 1,092,158 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $0.4 million and $54 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital expenditures grew in 2006 and 2005 due to increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after market devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $1.33 billion in 2007 as a result of reduced replacement activity and lower planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2007 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $4 million in 2006, $15 million in 2005 and $149 million in 2004. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2007. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 328,641 188,271 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 600,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 120,568 162,124 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (213,195 ) (200,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (165,324 ) (343,933 ) 620,690 406,462 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (663 ) (4,152 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 2,295 433 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 9,255 (593 ) Total changes in debt 631,577 402,150 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2006, compared with 32% at December 31, 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2006 Equity 2005 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,816,943 164% $ 2,185,366 143 % Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 77,998 117,062 Total obligations $ 2,894,941 168% $ 2,302,428 151 % (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2006 was driven by our increased capital spending required to support our contractual full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A significant downgrade of Ryders debt rating would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2006). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. Throughout 2006, we were in compliance with this and all other restrictive covenants for our revolving credit facility and do not expect the covenants to significantly affect our operations. The ratio at December 31, 2006 was 146%. At December 31, 2006, $113 million was available under the credit facility. During 1986, we issued at a discount $100 million principal amount of unsecured debentures due May 2016, with a stated interest rate of 9.0%, payable semi annually. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we retired $63 million principal amount of these debentures at a premium, which resulted in a charge of $2 million. The charge represents the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. During 2006, we issued $550 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, Ryder filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that was carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had $250 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs that would cause early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 11, 2007. At December 31, 2006, there were no receivables outstanding under the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 113 Shelf registration statement 250 Trade receivables facility 200 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables facility will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. In connection with these leases we have provided limited guarantees of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions during 2004 that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We have not entered into any sale leaseback transactions since 2004. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. In October 2006, Ryder entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of its independent directors. The terms of the indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that to the extent permitted by Florida law, Ryder will indemnify such director acting in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Ryder, against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $17 million and $16 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million and $3 million, respectively, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 332,124 269,720 1,468,587 743,003 2,813,434 Capital lease obligations 621 1,109 474 1,305 3,509 Total debt 332,745 270,829 1,469,061 744,308 2,816,943 Interest on debt(1) 139,648 245,390 138,172 262,139 785,349 Operating leases(2) 108,878 128,425 85,637 47,034 369,974 Purchase obligations(3) 340,427 41,850 4,350 386,627 Total contractual cash obligations 588,953 415,665 228,159 309,173 1,541,950 Insurance obligations(4) 117,311 113,414 47,754 29,930 308,409 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 24,831 3,667 2,010 48,591 79,099 Total $ 1,063,840 803,575 1,746,984 1,132,002 4,746,401 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2006. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations, deferred compensation obligations and derivative contracts. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2007, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $58 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2007 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $56 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Information At December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated net equity charge (after tax) of $201 million compared to $221 million as of December 31, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record a charge related to the unrecognized net actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition asset. The after tax equity charge of $201 million includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 which increased the equity charge by $151 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the equity charge of $178 million, prior to the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158, was principally the 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) result of fully funding accumulated benefit obligations of our primary pension plan. The improved funding levels resulted from strong investment returns on pension plan assets, global pension contributions during 2006, and a reduction in pension obligations as a result of a higher interest rate environment. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 14% in 2006. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2006, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $130 million compared with $12 million in 2005. After considering the 2006 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $56 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute will take effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will have on future pension funding requirements. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plan effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and will participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that meet the grandfathering criteria will be given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plan or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan is being replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plan. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the May 2006 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since March 1, 2006. The May 2006 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the May 2006 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. At December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.8 million shares under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $93 million. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the October 2005 program. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since May 1, 2004. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions, and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the July 2004 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. In October 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a $90 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Under the October 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the October 2003 program. In 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, under the October 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $44 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004. During 2006, we increased our annual dividend to $0.72 per share of common stock. In February 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.03 increase from the $0.18 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2006. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of the interest 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex to comparable earnings from continuing 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In 2006, GM accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. Based on sales activity to date, we expect favorable revenue comparisons to continue over the near term. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups and better margins in our Brazil operations. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a $3 million benefit, net of variable compensation, related to a contract termination. 2005 versus 2004 SCS total revenue growth in 2005 was due primarily to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. The favorable revenue comparisons for 2005 also reflect new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. In 2004, total revenue and operating revenue included $7 million associated with an international inventory procurement contract, the terms of which were favorably renegotiated late in the first quarter of 2004 to eliminate inventory risk that required net revenue reporting on a prospective basis. SCS total revenue and operating revenue also included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. In 2005, GM accounted for approximately 35% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $2 million in 2005 as a result of operating revenue growth from new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. These items were partially offset by lower volumes on certain automotive accounts, including the impact of plant shutdowns and launch costs associated with new business and lower margins in our Brazil operations during the first nine months of 2005. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006 as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. Despite declining revenue growth trends in the second half of 2006, we expect favorable revenue comparisons in 2007 based on planned investments in sales and marketing initiatives. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs, including a hurricane related recovery. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 2005 versus 2004 Total CSS costs declined in 2005 due primarily to cost benefits associated with the insourcing and renegotiation of several information technology infrastructure services and lower performance based incentive compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarter facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarter relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Financing activities 488,202 241,505 (195,760 ) Investing activities (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) (720,113 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (2,327 ) (3,956 ) 9,368 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (88 ) 27,756 (39,656 ) 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, due primarily to higher earnings (adjusted for non cash items) and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Cash provided by financing activities for 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher vehicle capital spending. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. We manage our business to maximize net cash provided by operating activities (operating cash flows) and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,079 326,752 288,674 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,575 6,963 42,839 Collections on direct finance leases 66,274 70,408 63,795 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 Other, net 2,163 512 Total cash generated 1,254,678 1,183,185 1,381,202 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) Acquisitions (4,113 ) (15,110 ) (148,791 ) Free cash flow $ (444,499 ) (231,304 ) 140,253 We used $444 million of free cash flow compared to a use of $231 million in 2005 due to increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We used $231 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $140 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially offset by lower acquisition spending. We anticipate free cash flow levels to improve in 2007 as a result of lower anticipated vehicle capital spending. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,492,720 1,082,332 862,994 Commercial rental 195,023 251,278 241,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 1,104,852 Operating property and equipment 71,772 77,360 59,767 Total capital expenditures 1,759,515 1,410,970 1,164,619 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (64,451 ) (11,591 ) (72,461 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,695,064 1,399,379 1,092,158 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $0.4 million and $54 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital expenditures grew in 2006 and 2005 due to increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after market devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $1.33 billion in 2007 as a result of reduced replacement activity and lower planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2007 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $4 million in 2006, $15 million in 2005 and $149 million in 2004. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2007. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 328,641 188,271 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 600,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 120,568 162,124 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (213,195 ) (200,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (165,324 ) (343,933 ) 620,690 406,462 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (663 ) (4,152 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 2,295 433 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 9,255 (593 ) Total changes in debt 631,577 402,150 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2006, compared with 32% at December 31, 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2006 Equity 2005 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,816,943 164% $ 2,185,366 143 % Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 77,998 117,062 Total obligations $ 2,894,941 168% $ 2,302,428 151 % (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2006 was driven by our increased capital spending required to support our contractual full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A significant downgrade of Ryders debt rating would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2006). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. Throughout 2006, we were in compliance with this and all other restrictive covenants for our revolving credit facility and do not expect the covenants to significantly affect our operations. The ratio at December 31, 2006 was 146%. At December 31, 2006, $113 million was available under the credit facility. During 1986, we issued at a discount $100 million principal amount of unsecured debentures due May 2016, with a stated interest rate of 9.0%, payable semi annually. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we retired $63 million principal amount of these debentures at a premium, which resulted in a charge of $2 million. The charge represents the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. During 2006, we issued $550 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, Ryder filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that was carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had $250 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs that would cause early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 11, 2007. At December 31, 2006, there were no receivables outstanding under the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 113 Shelf registration statement 250 Trade receivables facility 200 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables facility will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. In connection with these leases we have provided limited guarantees of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions during 2004 that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We have not entered into any sale leaseback transactions since 2004. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. In October 2006, Ryder entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of its independent directors. The terms of the indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that to the extent permitted by Florida law, Ryder will indemnify such director acting in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Ryder, against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $17 million and $16 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million and $3 million, respectively, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 332,124 269,720 1,468,587 743,003 2,813,434 Capital lease obligations 621 1,109 474 1,305 3,509 Total debt 332,745 270,829 1,469,061 744,308 2,816,943 Interest on debt(1) 139,648 245,390 138,172 262,139 785,349 Operating leases(2) 108,878 128,425 85,637 47,034 369,974 Purchase obligations(3) 340,427 41,850 4,350 386,627 Total contractual cash obligations 588,953 415,665 228,159 309,173 1,541,950 Insurance obligations(4) 117,311 113,414 47,754 29,930 308,409 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 24,831 3,667 2,010 48,591 79,099 Total $ 1,063,840 803,575 1,746,984 1,132,002 4,746,401 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2006. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations, deferred compensation obligations and derivative contracts. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2007, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $58 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2007 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $56 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Information At December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated net equity charge (after tax) of $201 million compared to $221 million as of December 31, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record a charge related to the unrecognized net actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition asset. The after tax equity charge of $201 million includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 which increased the equity charge by $151 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the equity charge of $178 million, prior to the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158, was principally the 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) result of fully funding accumulated benefit obligations of our primary pension plan. The improved funding levels resulted from strong investment returns on pension plan assets, global pension contributions during 2006, and a reduction in pension obligations as a result of a higher interest rate environment. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 14% in 2006. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2006, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $130 million compared with $12 million in 2005. After considering the 2006 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $56 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute will take effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will have on future pension funding requirements. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plan effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and will participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that meet the grandfathering criteria will be given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plan or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan is being replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plan. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the May 2006 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since March 1, 2006. The May 2006 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the May 2006 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. At December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.8 million shares under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $93 million. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the October 2005 program. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since May 1, 2004. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions, and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the July 2004 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. In October 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a $90 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Under the October 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the October 2003 program. In 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, under the October 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $44 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004. During 2006, we increased our annual dividend to $0.72 per share of common stock. In February 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.03 increase from the $0.18 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2006. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of the interest 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex to comparable earnings from continuing 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006 as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. Despite declining revenue growth trends in the second half of 2006, we expect favorable revenue comparisons in 2007 based on planned investments in sales and marketing initiatives. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs, including a hurricane related recovery. 2005 versus 2004 DCC revenue in 2005 increased as a result of new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $6 million reflecting the earnings leverage from new and expanded business and lower safety and other operating costs resulting from cost management and process improvement actions. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 2005 versus 2004 Total CSS costs declined in 2005 due primarily to cost benefits associated with the insourcing and renegotiation of several information technology infrastructure services and lower performance based incentive compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarter facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarter relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Financing activities 488,202 241,505 (195,760 ) Investing activities (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) (720,113 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (2,327 ) (3,956 ) 9,368 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (88 ) 27,756 (39,656 ) 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, due primarily to higher earnings (adjusted for non cash items) and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Cash provided by financing activities for 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher vehicle capital spending. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. We manage our business to maximize net cash provided by operating activities (operating cash flows) and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,079 326,752 288,674 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,575 6,963 42,839 Collections on direct finance leases 66,274 70,408 63,795 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 Other, net 2,163 512 Total cash generated 1,254,678 1,183,185 1,381,202 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) Acquisitions (4,113 ) (15,110 ) (148,791 ) Free cash flow $ (444,499 ) (231,304 ) 140,253 We used $444 million of free cash flow compared to a use of $231 million in 2005 due to increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We used $231 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $140 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially offset by lower acquisition spending. We anticipate free cash flow levels to improve in 2007 as a result of lower anticipated vehicle capital spending. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,492,720 1,082,332 862,994 Commercial rental 195,023 251,278 241,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 1,104,852 Operating property and equipment 71,772 77,360 59,767 Total capital expenditures 1,759,515 1,410,970 1,164,619 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (64,451 ) (11,591 ) (72,461 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,695,064 1,399,379 1,092,158 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $0.4 million and $54 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital expenditures grew in 2006 and 2005 due to increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after market devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $1.33 billion in 2007 as a result of reduced replacement activity and lower planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2007 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $4 million in 2006, $15 million in 2005 and $149 million in 2004. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2007. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 328,641 188,271 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 600,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 120,568 162,124 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (213,195 ) (200,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (165,324 ) (343,933 ) 620,690 406,462 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (663 ) (4,152 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 2,295 433 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 9,255 (593 ) Total changes in debt 631,577 402,150 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2006, compared with 32% at December 31, 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2006 Equity 2005 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,816,943 164% $ 2,185,366 143 % Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 77,998 117,062 Total obligations $ 2,894,941 168% $ 2,302,428 151 % (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2006 was driven by our increased capital spending required to support our contractual full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A significant downgrade of Ryders debt rating would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2006). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. Throughout 2006, we were in compliance with this and all other restrictive covenants for our revolving credit facility and do not expect the covenants to significantly affect our operations. The ratio at December 31, 2006 was 146%. At December 31, 2006, $113 million was available under the credit facility. During 1986, we issued at a discount $100 million principal amount of unsecured debentures due May 2016, with a stated interest rate of 9.0%, payable semi annually. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we retired $63 million principal amount of these debentures at a premium, which resulted in a charge of $2 million. The charge represents the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. During 2006, we issued $550 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, Ryder filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that was carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had $250 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs that would cause early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 11, 2007. At December 31, 2006, there were no receivables outstanding under the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 113 Shelf registration statement 250 Trade receivables facility 200 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables facility will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. In connection with these leases we have provided limited guarantees of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions during 2004 that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We have not entered into any sale leaseback transactions since 2004. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. In October 2006, Ryder entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of its independent directors. The terms of the indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that to the extent permitted by Florida law, Ryder will indemnify such director acting in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Ryder, against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $17 million and $16 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million and $3 million, respectively, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 332,124 269,720 1,468,587 743,003 2,813,434 Capital lease obligations 621 1,109 474 1,305 3,509 Total debt 332,745 270,829 1,469,061 744,308 2,816,943 Interest on debt(1) 139,648 245,390 138,172 262,139 785,349 Operating leases(2) 108,878 128,425 85,637 47,034 369,974 Purchase obligations(3) 340,427 41,850 4,350 386,627 Total contractual cash obligations 588,953 415,665 228,159 309,173 1,541,950 Insurance obligations(4) 117,311 113,414 47,754 29,930 308,409 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 24,831 3,667 2,010 48,591 79,099 Total $ 1,063,840 803,575 1,746,984 1,132,002 4,746,401 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2006. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations, deferred compensation obligations and derivative contracts. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2007, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $58 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2007 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $56 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Information At December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated net equity charge (after tax) of $201 million compared to $221 million as of December 31, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record a charge related to the unrecognized net actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition asset. The after tax equity charge of $201 million includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 which increased the equity charge by $151 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the equity charge of $178 million, prior to the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158, was principally the 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) result of fully funding accumulated benefit obligations of our primary pension plan. The improved funding levels resulted from strong investment returns on pension plan assets, global pension contributions during 2006, and a reduction in pension obligations as a result of a higher interest rate environment. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 14% in 2006. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2006, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $130 million compared with $12 million in 2005. After considering the 2006 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $56 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute will take effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will have on future pension funding requirements. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plan effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and will participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that meet the grandfathering criteria will be given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plan or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan is being replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plan. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the May 2006 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since March 1, 2006. The May 2006 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the May 2006 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. At December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.8 million shares under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $93 million. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the October 2005 program. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since May 1, 2004. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions, and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the July 2004 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. In October 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a $90 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Under the October 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the October 2003 program. In 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, under the October 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $44 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004. During 2006, we increased our annual dividend to $0.72 per share of common stock. In February 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.03 increase from the $0.18 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2006. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of the interest 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex to comparable earnings from continuing 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 2005 versus 2004 Total CSS costs declined in 2005 due primarily to cost benefits associated with the insourcing and renegotiation of several information technology infrastructure services and lower performance based incentive compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by higher spending in corporate services for moving and transition costs associated with the relocation to our new, smaller headquarter facility. Unallocated CSS expenses were up in 2005 largely due to the headquarter relocation costs and higher corporate initiatives spending. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Financing activities 488,202 241,505 (195,760 ) Investing activities (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) (720,113 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (2,327 ) (3,956 ) 9,368 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (88 ) 27,756 (39,656 ) 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, due primarily to higher earnings (adjusted for non cash items) and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Cash provided by financing activities for 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher vehicle capital spending. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. We manage our business to maximize net cash provided by operating activities (operating cash flows) and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,079 326,752 288,674 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,575 6,963 42,839 Collections on direct finance leases 66,274 70,408 63,795 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 Other, net 2,163 512 Total cash generated 1,254,678 1,183,185 1,381,202 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) Acquisitions (4,113 ) (15,110 ) (148,791 ) Free cash flow $ (444,499 ) (231,304 ) 140,253 We used $444 million of free cash flow compared to a use of $231 million in 2005 due to increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We used $231 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $140 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially offset by lower acquisition spending. We anticipate free cash flow levels to improve in 2007 as a result of lower anticipated vehicle capital spending. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,492,720 1,082,332 862,994 Commercial rental 195,023 251,278 241,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 1,104,852 Operating property and equipment 71,772 77,360 59,767 Total capital expenditures 1,759,515 1,410,970 1,164,619 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (64,451 ) (11,591 ) (72,461 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,695,064 1,399,379 1,092,158 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $0.4 million and $54 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital expenditures grew in 2006 and 2005 due to increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after market devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $1.33 billion in 2007 as a result of reduced replacement activity and lower planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2007 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $4 million in 2006, $15 million in 2005 and $149 million in 2004. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2007. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 328,641 188,271 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 600,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 120,568 162,124 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (213,195 ) (200,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (165,324 ) (343,933 ) 620,690 406,462 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (663 ) (4,152 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 2,295 433 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 9,255 (593 ) Total changes in debt 631,577 402,150 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2006, compared with 32% at December 31, 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2006 Equity 2005 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,816,943 164% $ 2,185,366 143 % Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 77,998 117,062 Total obligations $ 2,894,941 168% $ 2,302,428 151 % (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2006 was driven by our increased capital spending required to support our contractual full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A significant downgrade of Ryders debt rating would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2006). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. Throughout 2006, we were in compliance with this and all other restrictive covenants for our revolving credit facility and do not expect the covenants to significantly affect our operations. The ratio at December 31, 2006 was 146%. At December 31, 2006, $113 million was available under the credit facility. During 1986, we issued at a discount $100 million principal amount of unsecured debentures due May 2016, with a stated interest rate of 9.0%, payable semi annually. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we retired $63 million principal amount of these debentures at a premium, which resulted in a charge of $2 million. The charge represents the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. During 2006, we issued $550 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, Ryder filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that was carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had $250 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs that would cause early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 11, 2007. At December 31, 2006, there were no receivables outstanding under the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 113 Shelf registration statement 250 Trade receivables facility 200 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables facility will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. In connection with these leases we have provided limited guarantees of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions during 2004 that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We have not entered into any sale leaseback transactions since 2004. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. In October 2006, Ryder entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of its independent directors. The terms of the indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that to the extent permitted by Florida law, Ryder will indemnify such director acting in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Ryder, against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $17 million and $16 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million and $3 million, respectively, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 332,124 269,720 1,468,587 743,003 2,813,434 Capital lease obligations 621 1,109 474 1,305 3,509 Total debt 332,745 270,829 1,469,061 744,308 2,816,943 Interest on debt(1) 139,648 245,390 138,172 262,139 785,349 Operating leases(2) 108,878 128,425 85,637 47,034 369,974 Purchase obligations(3) 340,427 41,850 4,350 386,627 Total contractual cash obligations 588,953 415,665 228,159 309,173 1,541,950 Insurance obligations(4) 117,311 113,414 47,754 29,930 308,409 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 24,831 3,667 2,010 48,591 79,099 Total $ 1,063,840 803,575 1,746,984 1,132,002 4,746,401 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2006. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations, deferred compensation obligations and derivative contracts. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2007, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $58 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2007 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $56 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Information At December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated net equity charge (after tax) of $201 million compared to $221 million as of December 31, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record a charge related to the unrecognized net actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition asset. The after tax equity charge of $201 million includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 which increased the equity charge by $151 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the equity charge of $178 million, prior to the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158, was principally the 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) result of fully funding accumulated benefit obligations of our primary pension plan. The improved funding levels resulted from strong investment returns on pension plan assets, global pension contributions during 2006, and a reduction in pension obligations as a result of a higher interest rate environment. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 14% in 2006. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2006, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $130 million compared with $12 million in 2005. After considering the 2006 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $56 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute will take effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will have on future pension funding requirements. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plan effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and will participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that meet the grandfathering criteria will be given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plan or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan is being replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plan. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the May 2006 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since March 1, 2006. The May 2006 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the May 2006 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. At December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.8 million shares under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $93 million. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the October 2005 program. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since May 1, 2004. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions, and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the July 2004 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. In October 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a $90 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Under the October 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the October 2003 program. In 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, under the October 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $44 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004. During 2006, we increased our annual dividend to $0.72 per share of common stock. In February 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.03 increase from the $0.18 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2006. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of the interest 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex to comparable earnings from continuing 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, due primarily to higher earnings (adjusted for non cash items) and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Cash provided by financing activities for 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and $114 million of estimated 2004 and 2005 tax payments made during 2005. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 compared with cash used in financing activities in 2004 due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to higher vehicle capital spending. The increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. We manage our business to maximize net cash provided by operating activities (operating cash flows) and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,079 326,752 288,674 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,575 6,963 42,839 Collections on direct finance leases 66,274 70,408 63,795 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 Other, net 2,163 512 Total cash generated 1,254,678 1,183,185 1,381,202 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) Acquisitions (4,113 ) (15,110 ) (148,791 ) Free cash flow $ (444,499 ) (231,304 ) 140,253 We used $444 million of free cash flow compared to a use of $231 million in 2005 due to increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We used $231 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $140 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially offset by lower acquisition spending. We anticipate free cash flow levels to improve in 2007 as a result of lower anticipated vehicle capital spending. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,492,720 1,082,332 862,994 Commercial rental 195,023 251,278 241,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 1,104,852 Operating property and equipment 71,772 77,360 59,767 Total capital expenditures 1,759,515 1,410,970 1,164,619 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (64,451 ) (11,591 ) (72,461 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,695,064 1,399,379 1,092,158 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $0.4 million and $54 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital expenditures grew in 2006 and 2005 due to increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after market devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $1.33 billion in 2007 as a result of reduced replacement activity and lower planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2007 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $4 million in 2006, $15 million in 2005 and $149 million in 2004. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2007. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 328,641 188,271 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 600,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 120,568 162,124 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (213,195 ) (200,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (165,324 ) (343,933 ) 620,690 406,462 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (663 ) (4,152 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 2,295 433 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 9,255 (593 ) Total changes in debt 631,577 402,150 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2006, compared with 32% at December 31, 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2006 Equity 2005 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,816,943 164% $ 2,185,366 143 % Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 77,998 117,062 Total obligations $ 2,894,941 168% $ 2,302,428 151 % (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2006 was driven by our increased capital spending required to support our contractual full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A significant downgrade of Ryders debt rating would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2006). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. Throughout 2006, we were in compliance with this and all other restrictive covenants for our revolving credit facility and do not expect the covenants to significantly affect our operations. The ratio at December 31, 2006 was 146%. At December 31, 2006, $113 million was available under the credit facility. During 1986, we issued at a discount $100 million principal amount of unsecured debentures due May 2016, with a stated interest rate of 9.0%, payable semi annually. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we retired $63 million principal amount of these debentures at a premium, which resulted in a charge of $2 million. The charge represents the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. During 2006, we issued $550 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, Ryder filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that was carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had $250 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs that would cause early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 11, 2007. At December 31, 2006, there were no receivables outstanding under the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 113 Shelf registration statement 250 Trade receivables facility 200 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables facility will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. In connection with these leases we have provided limited guarantees of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions during 2004 that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We have not entered into any sale leaseback transactions since 2004. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. In October 2006, Ryder entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of its independent directors. The terms of the indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that to the extent permitted by Florida law, Ryder will indemnify such director acting in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Ryder, against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $17 million and $16 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million and $3 million, respectively, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 332,124 269,720 1,468,587 743,003 2,813,434 Capital lease obligations 621 1,109 474 1,305 3,509 Total debt 332,745 270,829 1,469,061 744,308 2,816,943 Interest on debt(1) 139,648 245,390 138,172 262,139 785,349 Operating leases(2) 108,878 128,425 85,637 47,034 369,974 Purchase obligations(3) 340,427 41,850 4,350 386,627 Total contractual cash obligations 588,953 415,665 228,159 309,173 1,541,950 Insurance obligations(4) 117,311 113,414 47,754 29,930 308,409 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 24,831 3,667 2,010 48,591 79,099 Total $ 1,063,840 803,575 1,746,984 1,132,002 4,746,401 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2006. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations, deferred compensation obligations and derivative contracts. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2007, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $58 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2007 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $56 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Information At December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated net equity charge (after tax) of $201 million compared to $221 million as of December 31, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record a charge related to the unrecognized net actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition asset. The after tax equity charge of $201 million includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 which increased the equity charge by $151 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the equity charge of $178 million, prior to the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158, was principally the 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) result of fully funding accumulated benefit obligations of our primary pension plan. The improved funding levels resulted from strong investment returns on pension plan assets, global pension contributions during 2006, and a reduction in pension obligations as a result of a higher interest rate environment. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 14% in 2006. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2006, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $130 million compared with $12 million in 2005. After considering the 2006 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $56 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute will take effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will have on future pension funding requirements. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plan effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and will participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that meet the grandfathering criteria will be given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plan or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan is being replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plan. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the May 2006 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since March 1, 2006. The May 2006 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the May 2006 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. At December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.8 million shares under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $93 million. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the October 2005 program. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since May 1, 2004. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions, and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the July 2004 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. In October 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a $90 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Under the October 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the October 2003 program. In 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, under the October 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $44 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004. During 2006, we increased our annual dividend to $0.72 per share of common stock. In February 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.03 increase from the $0.18 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2006. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of the interest 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex to comparable earnings from continuing 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 853,587 779,062 866,849 Sales of revenue earning equipment 326,079 326,752 288,674 Sales of operating property and equipment 6,575 6,963 42,839 Collections on direct finance leases 66,274 70,408 63,795 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 118,533 Other, net 2,163 512 Total cash generated 1,254,678 1,183,185 1,381,202 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) (1,092,158 ) Acquisitions (4,113 ) (15,110 ) (148,791 ) Free cash flow $ (444,499 ) (231,304 ) 140,253 We used $444 million of free cash flow compared to a use of $231 million in 2005 due to increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We used $231 million of free cash flow in 2005 compared to generating $140 million in 2004 due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially offset by lower acquisition spending. We anticipate free cash flow levels to improve in 2007 as a result of lower anticipated vehicle capital spending. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 1,492,720 1,082,332 862,994 Commercial rental 195,023 251,278 241,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 1,104,852 Operating property and equipment 71,772 77,360 59,767 Total capital expenditures 1,759,515 1,410,970 1,164,619 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (64,451 ) (11,591 ) (72,461 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,695,064 1,399,379 1,092,158 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $0.4 million and $54 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital expenditures grew in 2006 and 2005 due to increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after market devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $1.33 billion in 2007 as a result of reduced replacement activity and lower planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2007 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $4 million in 2006, $15 million in 2005 and $149 million in 2004. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2007. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 328,641 188,271 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 600,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 120,568 162,124 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (213,195 ) (200,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (165,324 ) (343,933 ) 620,690 406,462 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (663 ) (4,152 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 2,295 433 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 9,255 (593 ) Total changes in debt 631,577 402,150 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2006, compared with 32% at December 31, 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2006 Equity 2005 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,816,943 164% $ 2,185,366 143 % Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 77,998 117,062 Total obligations $ 2,894,941 168% $ 2,302,428 151 % (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2006 was driven by our increased capital spending required to support our contractual full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A significant downgrade of Ryders debt rating would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2006). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. Throughout 2006, we were in compliance with this and all other restrictive covenants for our revolving credit facility and do not expect the covenants to significantly affect our operations. The ratio at December 31, 2006 was 146%. At December 31, 2006, $113 million was available under the credit facility. During 1986, we issued at a discount $100 million principal amount of unsecured debentures due May 2016, with a stated interest rate of 9.0%, payable semi annually. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we retired $63 million principal amount of these debentures at a premium, which resulted in a charge of $2 million. The charge represents the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. During 2006, we issued $550 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, Ryder filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that was carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had $250 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs that would cause early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 11, 2007. At December 31, 2006, there were no receivables outstanding under the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 113 Shelf registration statement 250 Trade receivables facility 200 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables facility will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. In connection with these leases we have provided limited guarantees of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions during 2004 that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We have not entered into any sale leaseback transactions since 2004. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. In October 2006, Ryder entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of its independent directors. The terms of the indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that to the extent permitted by Florida law, Ryder will indemnify such director acting in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Ryder, against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $17 million and $16 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million and $3 million, respectively, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 332,124 269,720 1,468,587 743,003 2,813,434 Capital lease obligations 621 1,109 474 1,305 3,509 Total debt 332,745 270,829 1,469,061 744,308 2,816,943 Interest on debt(1) 139,648 245,390 138,172 262,139 785,349 Operating leases(2) 108,878 128,425 85,637 47,034 369,974 Purchase obligations(3) 340,427 41,850 4,350 386,627 Total contractual cash obligations 588,953 415,665 228,159 309,173 1,541,950 Insurance obligations(4) 117,311 113,414 47,754 29,930 308,409 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 24,831 3,667 2,010 48,591 79,099 Total $ 1,063,840 803,575 1,746,984 1,132,002 4,746,401 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2006. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations, deferred compensation obligations and derivative contracts. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2007, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $58 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2007 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $56 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Information At December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated net equity charge (after tax) of $201 million compared to $221 million as of December 31, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record a charge related to the unrecognized net actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition asset. The after tax equity charge of $201 million includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 which increased the equity charge by $151 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the equity charge of $178 million, prior to the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158, was principally the 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) result of fully funding accumulated benefit obligations of our primary pension plan. The improved funding levels resulted from strong investment returns on pension plan assets, global pension contributions during 2006, and a reduction in pension obligations as a result of a higher interest rate environment. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 14% in 2006. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2006, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $130 million compared with $12 million in 2005. After considering the 2006 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $56 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute will take effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will have on future pension funding requirements. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plan effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and will participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that meet the grandfathering criteria will be given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plan or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan is being replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plan. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the May 2006 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since March 1, 2006. The May 2006 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the May 2006 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. At December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.8 million shares under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $93 million. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the October 2005 program. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since May 1, 2004. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions, and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the July 2004 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. In October 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a $90 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Under the October 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the October 2003 program. In 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, under the October 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $44 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004. During 2006, we increased our annual dividend to $0.72 per share of common stock. In February 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.03 increase from the $0.18 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2006. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of the interest 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex to comparable earnings from continuing 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital expenditures grew in 2006 and 2005 due to increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after market devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $1.33 billion in 2007 as a result of reduced replacement activity and lower planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2007 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2005 and 2004, Ryder completed an acquisition related to the FMS segment. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was $4 million in 2006, $15 million in 2005 and $149 million in 2004. See Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2007. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2006 2005 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,185,366 1,783,216 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 328,641 188,271 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 600,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 120,568 162,124 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (213,195 ) (200,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (165,324 ) (343,933 ) 620,690 406,462 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (663 ) (4,152 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 2,295 433 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 9,255 (593 ) Total changes in debt 631,577 402,150 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2006, compared with 32% at December 31, 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2006 Equity 2005 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,816,943 164% $ 2,185,366 143 % Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 77,998 117,062 Total obligations $ 2,894,941 168% $ 2,302,428 151 % (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2006 was driven by our increased capital spending required to support our contractual full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A significant downgrade of Ryders debt rating would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2006). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. Throughout 2006, we were in compliance with this and all other restrictive covenants for our revolving credit facility and do not expect the covenants to significantly affect our operations. The ratio at December 31, 2006 was 146%. At December 31, 2006, $113 million was available under the credit facility. During 1986, we issued at a discount $100 million principal amount of unsecured debentures due May 2016, with a stated interest rate of 9.0%, payable semi annually. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we retired $63 million principal amount of these debentures at a premium, which resulted in a charge of $2 million. The charge represents the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. During 2006, we issued $550 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, Ryder filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that was carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had $250 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs that would cause early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 11, 2007. At December 31, 2006, there were no receivables outstanding under the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 113 Shelf registration statement 250 Trade receivables facility 200 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables facility will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. In connection with these leases we have provided limited guarantees of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions during 2004 that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We have not entered into any sale leaseback transactions since 2004. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. In October 2006, Ryder entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of its independent directors. The terms of the indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that to the extent permitted by Florida law, Ryder will indemnify such director acting in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Ryder, against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $17 million and $16 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million and $3 million, respectively, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations.

Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes.

Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations, deferred compensation obligations and derivative contracts. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2007, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $58 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2007 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $56 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Information At December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated net equity charge (after tax) of $201 million compared to $221 million as of December 31, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record a charge related to the unrecognized net actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition asset. The after tax equity charge of $201 million includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 which increased the equity charge by $151 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the equity charge of $178 million, prior to the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158, was principally the 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) result of fully funding accumulated benefit obligations of our primary pension plan. The improved funding levels resulted from strong investment returns on pension plan assets, global pension contributions during 2006, and a reduction in pension obligations as a result of a higher interest rate environment. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 14% in 2006. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2006, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $130 million compared with $12 million in 2005. After considering the 2006 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $56 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute will take effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will have on future pension funding requirements. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plan effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and will participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that meet the grandfathering criteria will be given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plan or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan is being replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plan. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the May 2006 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since March 1, 2006. The May 2006 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the May 2006 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. At December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.8 million shares under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $93 million. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the October 2005 program. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since May 1, 2004. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions, and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the July 2004 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. In October 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a $90 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Under the October 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the October 2003 program. In 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, under the October 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $44 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004. During 2006, we increased our annual dividend to $0.72 per share of common stock. In February 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.03 increase from the $0.18 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2006. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of the interest 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % to December 31, % to 2006 Equity 2005 Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,816,943 164% $ 2,185,366 143 % Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 77,998 117,062 Total obligations $ 2,894,941 168% $ 2,302,428 151 % (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments Ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. Debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in leverage ratios in 2006 was driven by our increased capital spending required to support our contractual full service lease business, pension contributions and stock repurchases. Our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300% while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets. A significant downgrade of Ryders debt rating would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) Ryder can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2006). At Ryders option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. Throughout 2006, we were in compliance with this and all other restrictive covenants for our revolving credit facility and do not expect the covenants to significantly affect our operations. The ratio at December 31, 2006 was 146%. At December 31, 2006, $113 million was available under the credit facility. During 1986, we issued at a discount $100 million principal amount of unsecured debentures due May 2016, with a stated interest rate of 9.0%, payable semi annually. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we retired $63 million principal amount of these debentures at a premium, which resulted in a charge of $2 million. The charge represents the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. During 2006, we issued $550 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, Ryder filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that was carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had $250 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs that would cause early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 11, 2007. At December 31, 2006, there were no receivables outstanding under the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 113 Shelf registration statement 250 Trade receivables facility 200 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables facility will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. In connection with these leases we have provided limited guarantees of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions during 2004 that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We have not entered into any sale leaseback transactions since 2004. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. In October 2006, Ryder entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of its independent directors. The terms of the indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that to the extent permitted by Florida law, Ryder will indemnify such director acting in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Ryder, against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $17 million and $16 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million and $3 million, respectively, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 332,124 269,720 1,468,587 743,003 2,813,434 Capital lease obligations 621 1,109 474 1,305 3,509 Total debt 332,745 270,829 1,469,061 744,308 2,816,943 Interest on debt(1) 139,648 245,390 138,172 262,139 785,349 Operating leases(2) 108,878 128,425 85,637 47,034 369,974 Purchase obligations(3) 340,427 41,850 4,350 386,627 Total contractual cash obligations 588,953 415,665 228,159 309,173 1,541,950 Insurance obligations(4) 117,311 113,414 47,754 29,930 308,409 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 24,831 3,667 2,010 48,591 79,099 Total $ 1,063,840 803,575 1,746,984 1,132,002 4,746,401 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2006. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations, deferred compensation obligations and derivative contracts. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2007, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $58 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2007 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $56 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Information At December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated net equity charge (after tax) of $201 million compared to $221 million as of December 31, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record a charge related to the unrecognized net actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition asset. The after tax equity charge of $201 million includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 which increased the equity charge by $151 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the equity charge of $178 million, prior to the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158, was principally the 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) result of fully funding accumulated benefit obligations of our primary pension plan. The improved funding levels resulted from strong investment returns on pension plan assets, global pension contributions during 2006, and a reduction in pension obligations as a result of a higher interest rate environment. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 14% in 2006. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2006, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $130 million compared with $12 million in 2005. After considering the 2006 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $56 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute will take effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will have on future pension funding requirements. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plan effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and will participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that meet the grandfathering criteria will be given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plan or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan is being replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plan. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the May 2006 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since March 1, 2006. The May 2006 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the May 2006 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. At December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.8 million shares under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $93 million. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the October 2005 program. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since May 1, 2004. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions, and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the July 2004 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. In October 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a $90 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Under the October 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the October 2003 program. In 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, under the October 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $44 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004. During 2006, we increased our annual dividend to $0.72 per share of common stock. In February 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.03 increase from the $0.18 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2006. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of the interest 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex to comparable earnings from continuing 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, Ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. Throughout 2006, we were in compliance with this and all other restrictive covenants for our revolving credit facility and do not expect the covenants to significantly affect our operations. The ratio at December 31, 2006 was 146%. At December 31, 2006, $113 million was available under the credit facility. During 1986, we issued at a discount $100 million principal amount of unsecured debentures due May 2016, with a stated interest rate of 9.0%, payable semi annually. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we retired $63 million principal amount of these debentures at a premium, which resulted in a charge of $2 million. The charge represents the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. During 2006, we issued $550 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. During 2005, we issued $600 million of unsecured medium term notes, of which $225 million mature in April 2010, $175 million mature in April 2011 and $200 million mature in June 2012. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. During 2005, Ryder filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue up to $800 million of securities, including $65 million of available securities that was carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement. Proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had $250 million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement. In September 2005, Ryder Receivable Funding, II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, entered into a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with various financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC who in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. Ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in Ryders unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs that would cause early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 11, 2007. At December 31, 2006, there were no receivables outstanding under the Trade Receivables Agreement. At December 31, 2006, Ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 113 Shelf registration statement 250 Trade receivables facility 200 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables facility will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. In connection with these leases we have provided limited guarantees of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions during 2004 that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We have not entered into any sale leaseback transactions since 2004. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. In October 2006, Ryder entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of its independent directors. The terms of the indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that to the extent permitted by Florida law, Ryder will indemnify such director acting in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Ryder, against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $17 million and $16 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million and $3 million, respectively, as a corresponding liability.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 332,124 269,720 1,468,587 743,003 2,813,434 Capital lease obligations 621 1,109 474 1,305 3,509 Total debt 332,745 270,829 1,469,061 744,308 2,816,943 Interest on debt(1) 139,648 245,390 138,172 262,139 785,349 Operating leases(2) 108,878 128,425 85,637 47,034 369,974 Purchase obligations(3) 340,427 41,850 4,350 386,627 Total contractual cash obligations 588,953 415,665 228,159 309,173 1,541,950 Insurance obligations(4) 117,311 113,414 47,754 29,930 308,409 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 24,831 3,667 2,010 48,591 79,099 Total $ 1,063,840 803,575 1,746,984 1,132,002 4,746,401 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2006. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations, deferred compensation obligations and derivative contracts. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2007, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $58 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2007 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $56 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Information At December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated net equity charge (after tax) of $201 million compared to $221 million as of December 31, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record a charge related to the unrecognized net actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition asset. The after tax equity charge of $201 million includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 which increased the equity charge by $151 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the equity charge of $178 million, prior to the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158, was principally the 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) result of fully funding accumulated benefit obligations of our primary pension plan. The improved funding levels resulted from strong investment returns on pension plan assets, global pension contributions during 2006, and a reduction in pension obligations as a result of a higher interest rate environment. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 14% in 2006. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2006, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $130 million compared with $12 million in 2005. After considering the 2006 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $56 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute will take effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will have on future pension funding requirements. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plan effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and will participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that meet the grandfathering criteria will be given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plan or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan is being replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plan. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the May 2006 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since March 1, 2006. The May 2006 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the May 2006 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. At December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.8 million shares under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $93 million. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the October 2005 program. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since May 1, 2004. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions, and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the July 2004 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. In October 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a $90 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Under the October 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the October 2003 program. In 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, under the October 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $44 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004. During 2006, we increased our annual dividend to $0.72 per share of common stock. In February 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.03 increase from the $0.18 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2006. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of the interest 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex to comparable earnings from continuing 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. During 2004, we completed two sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be VIEs and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions totaled $97 million. In connection with these leases we have provided limited guarantees of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. Proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions during 2004 that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were $22 million. We have not entered into any sale leaseback transactions since 2004. Guarantees. Ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require Ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by Ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow Ryder to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, Ryders obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. In October 2006, Ryder entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of its independent directors. The terms of the indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that to the extent permitted by Florida law, Ryder will indemnify such director acting in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Ryder, against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $17 million and $16 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million and $3 million, respectively, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 332,124 269,720 1,468,587 743,003 2,813,434 Capital lease obligations 621 1,109 474 1,305 3,509 Total debt 332,745 270,829 1,469,061 744,308 2,816,943 Interest on debt(1) 139,648 245,390 138,172 262,139 785,349 Operating leases(2) 108,878 128,425 85,637 47,034 369,974 Purchase obligations(3) 340,427 41,850 4,350 386,627 Total contractual cash obligations 588,953 415,665 228,159 309,173 1,541,950 Insurance obligations(4) 117,311 113,414 47,754 29,930 308,409 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 24,831 3,667 2,010 48,591 79,099 Total $ 1,063,840 803,575 1,746,984 1,132,002 4,746,401 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2006. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations, deferred compensation obligations and derivative contracts. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2007, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $58 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2007 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $56 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Information At December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated net equity charge (after tax) of $201 million compared to $221 million as of December 31, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record a charge related to the unrecognized net actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition asset. The after tax equity charge of $201 million includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 which increased the equity charge by $151 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the equity charge of $178 million, prior to the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158, was principally the 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) result of fully funding accumulated benefit obligations of our primary pension plan. The improved funding levels resulted from strong investment returns on pension plan assets, global pension contributions during 2006, and a reduction in pension obligations as a result of a higher interest rate environment. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 14% in 2006. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2006, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $130 million compared with $12 million in 2005. After considering the 2006 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $56 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute will take effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will have on future pension funding requirements. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plan effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and will participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that meet the grandfathering criteria will be given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plan or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan is being replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plan. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the May 2006 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since March 1, 2006. The May 2006 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the May 2006 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. At December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.8 million shares under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $93 million. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the October 2005 program. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since May 1, 2004. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions, and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the July 2004 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. In October 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a $90 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Under the October 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the October 2003 program. In 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, under the October 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $44 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004. During 2006, we increased our annual dividend to $0.72 per share of common stock. In February 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.03 increase from the $0.18 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2006. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of the interest 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex to comparable earnings from continuing 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 332,124 269,720 1,468,587 743,003 2,813,434 Capital lease obligations 621 1,109 474 1,305 3,509 Total debt 332,745 270,829 1,469,061 744,308 2,816,943 Interest on debt(1) 139,648 245,390 138,172 262,139 785,349 Operating leases(2) 108,878 128,425 85,637 47,034 369,974 Purchase obligations(3) 340,427 41,850 4,350 386,627 Total contractual cash obligations 588,953 415,665 228,159 309,173 1,541,950 Insurance obligations(4) 117,311 113,414 47,754 29,930 308,409 Other long term liabilities(5),(6) 24,831 3,667 2,010 48,591 79,099 Total $ 1,063,840 803,575 1,746,984 1,132,002 4,746,401 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2006. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations, deferred compensation obligations and derivative contracts. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2007, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $58 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2007 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next 5 years is approximately $56 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Information At December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated net equity charge (after tax) of $201 million compared to $221 million as of December 31, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 required us to record a charge related to the unrecognized net actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition asset. The after tax equity charge of $201 million includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 which increased the equity charge by $151 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the equity charge of $178 million, prior to the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158, was principally the 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) result of fully funding accumulated benefit obligations of our primary pension plan. The improved funding levels resulted from strong investment returns on pension plan assets, global pension contributions during 2006, and a reduction in pension obligations as a result of a higher interest rate environment. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 14% in 2006. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2006, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $130 million compared with $12 million in 2005. After considering the 2006 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $56 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute will take effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will have on future pension funding requirements. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plan effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and will participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that meet the grandfathering criteria will be given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plan or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan is being replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plan. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the May 2006 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since March 1, 2006. The May 2006 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the May 2006 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. At December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.8 million shares under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $93 million. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the October 2005 program. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since May 1, 2004. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions, and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the July 2004 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. In October 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a $90 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Under the October 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the October 2003 program. In 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, under the October 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $44 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004. During 2006, we increased our annual dividend to $0.72 per share of common stock. In February 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.03 increase from the $0.18 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2006. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of the interest 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex to comparable earnings from continuing 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required by ITEM 7A is included in ITEM 7 (pages 48 through 50) of PART II of this report. 56 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) result of fully funding accumulated benefit obligations of our primary pension plan. The improved funding levels resulted from strong investment returns on pension plan assets, global pension contributions during 2006, and a reduction in pension obligations as a result of a higher interest rate environment. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 14% in 2006. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2006, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $130 million compared with $12 million in 2005. After considering the 2006 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $56 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2006 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute will take effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will have on future pension funding requirements. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plan effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and will participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that meet the grandfathering criteria will be given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plan or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan is being replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plan. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the May 2006 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since March 1, 2006. The May 2006 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the May 2006 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. At December 31, 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.8 million shares under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $93 million. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the October 2005 program. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since May 1, 2004. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions, and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the July 2004 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. In October 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a $90 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Under the October 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the October 2003 program. In 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, under the October 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $44 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004. During 2006, we increased our annual dividend to $0.72 per share of common stock. In February 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.03 increase from the $0.18 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2006. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of the interest 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex to comparable earnings from continuing 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required by ITEM 7A is included in ITEM 7 (pages 48 through 50) of PART II of this report. 56 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the October 2005 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed the October 2005 program. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Under the July 2004 program, shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan since May 1, 2004. The July 2004 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 3.5 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions, and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management established a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the July 2004 program, which allowed for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we replaced the July 2004 program with the October 2005 program noted previously. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.0 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million and $62 million, respectively. In October 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a $90 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Under the October 2003 program, shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since January 1, 2003. Share repurchases of common stock were made periodically in open market transactions and were subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the October 2003 program. In 2004, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, under the October 2003 program at an aggregate cost of $87 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $44 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $39 million in 2004. During 2006, we increased our annual dividend to $0.72 per share of common stock. In February 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.03 increase from the $0.18 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2006. Market Risk In the normal course of business, Ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of the interest 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex to comparable earnings from continuing 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required by ITEM 7A is included in ITEM 7 (pages 48 through 50) of PART II of this report. 56 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swap. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.52 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.51 billion, including the effects of interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2005 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as a liability totaling $0.2 million. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $661 million of variable rate debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $185 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% to LIBOR based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.8 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2007 pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a $78 million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million and $10 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $0.3 million. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $10 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2006, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex to comparable earnings from continuing 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact Ryders results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The operations of Ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $1 million in 2006 and 2005 and $2 million in 2004. We incurred environmental expenses of $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2006 levels in the near term. The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on Ryders financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on Ryders financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. We consider factors such 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2006, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2007, which will cause depreciation expense in 2007 to decrease by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2007 by approximately $80 million. Ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2006, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2007 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. Ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 77% equity securities and 23% debt securities and other investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss beginning December 31, 2006. Previously, these amounts were not recorded. We have an actuarial loss of $318 million at the end of 2006 compared with a loss of $428 million at the end of 2005. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2006 resulted from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates and plan assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) active participants. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2007 will be $165 million. The effect on years beyond 2007 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2006 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2007 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2007 Net December 31, 2006 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 5.73% + 0.25% $6 million $39 million Discount rate decrease 5.73% 0.25% + $5 million + $39 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. On an annual basis, third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2006, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2007 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2006, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled $159 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. As a result of entering into a management subcontracted transportation contract in 2005, under which we have determined we are acting as principal, the amount of managed subcontracted transportation expense and corresponding revenue has increased significantly. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Ryders overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $238 million and $235 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 and 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. In 2005, the IRS began auditing our federal income tax returns for 2001 to 2003. We believe that Ryder has not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in its most recent audit.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations excluding net tax benefits, pension accounting charge and gain on sale of headquarter complex. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
